            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Conſideration has induced me to ſet the Example of the Holy Jeſus before my ſelf and you, in theſe <hi>Plain, Practical Notes</hi> upon the <hi>Holy Evangeliſts,</hi> which contain Remarks upon the Hiſtory of our Saviour's <hi>Life, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and of His <hi>Death, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> To the Intent that the <hi>Temper</hi> of our <hi>Minds;</hi> and the <hi>Actions</hi> of our <hi>Lives,</hi> may be a lively Tranſcript of the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Redeemer.</hi> That we may <hi>Admire</hi> and <hi>Imitate</hi> His unſpotted <hi>Purity,</hi> His Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending <hi>Humility,</hi> His Fervent <hi>Charity,</hi> His <hi>Patience</hi> under Sufferings and Reproaches, His Readineſs to <hi>Forgive</hi> Injuries, and His entire <hi>Reſignation</hi> to the <hi>Divine Will</hi> in all Conditions of Life whatſoever. That ſo following our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> in all the Steps of an <hi>Imitable Vertue,</hi> and ſetting His <hi>Example</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before us, we may be Daily Correcting and Reforming of our Lives by that <hi>Glorious Pattern;</hi> for without preſent Likeneſs to Him, we have no Grounds to hope that we ſhall hereafter Live with Him.</p>
            <p>A true <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to your <hi>Souls,</hi> and a fervent Deſire to farther their <hi>Salvation</hi> from the <hi>Preſs,</hi> as well as from the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> has put me upon Redeeming Time for this <hi>Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must acknowledge my conſtant Preaching thrice a Week unto you, (beſides Occaſionals) and Viſiting as often a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſcattering Pariſh from Houſe to Houſe amongſt you, (which I have always accounted a most Important Part of my Duty) would allow me but little, <hi>too little Time,</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Work</hi> as <hi>This,</hi> which I heartily wiſh had fallen upon the Shoulder of one that had <hi>more Leiſure,</hi> and <hi>Greater Abilities</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:4"/> for it. But thus much I can truly ſay, that earnestly Imploring Divine Aſſiſtance, <hi>I have done what I could;</hi> my <hi>Work</hi> has been my <hi>Recreation,</hi> and the Lord accept it, and ſucceed it.</p>
            <p>And I have this Obſervation to Ground my Hope of <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Succeſs</hi> upon, that Almighty God has in all Ages ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thoſe Labours of his Servants, (how mean ſoever in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) most Acceptable and Uſeful, which have been employed in the profitable Explication of any part of the Holy Scriptures. As if <hi>He</hi> who Imprinted ſuch a Majeſty upon the Text, delighted alſo to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect an Honour upon the Interpreters thereof.</p>
            <p>My Deſign in preparing and giving theſe Notes into your Hands, is to <hi>Oblige</hi> you to <hi>Read</hi> a part of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> in your <hi>Families</hi> every Day; and to invite you thereunto, the Sacred Text is here at large Recited, Controverſies Declined, and References Avoided. I have choſen to Tranſcribe and Write over again upon <hi>another Evangeliſt</hi> what was obſerved in a <hi>Former,</hi> rather than give you the Trouble of looking back upon what is written elſewhere.</p>
            <p>And I do moſt Affectionately Request you not to ſuffer the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word of God,</hi> which is in all your Hands, to lye by you as a <hi>Neglected Book,</hi> but daily to Read it in and to your <hi>Families,</hi> with a Simplicity of Mind to be Directed and Inſtructed by it.</p>
            <p>All the Return I deſire from you for this <hi>my Labour of Love,</hi> is your living in a daily Imitation of that Grand Pattern of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obedience, which is here ſet before you, and in every Page Recommended to you; and that we may continue to ſtrive together in our Prayers one with, and one for another, for that Grace, which may enable us to the Faithful Diſcharge of our Reſpective Duties towards God, towards each other, and all Mankind. And that the Happy Unity and Unanimity which has hitherto been amongst us, may continue and encreaſe ſtill with us, to the Glory of God, the Honour of our Holy Religion, the preſent Benefit and Comfort, and the Eternal Joy and Rejoycing both of Miniſter and People in the Day of the Lord Jeſus. Which, as it is the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer, ſo it ſhall be the conſtant Endeavour of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Miniſter, whoſe Highest Ambition it is to ſerve you in the Faith and Fellowſhip of the Goſpel, whilst I am,</p>

The Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contains the Law and the Prophets: The Writings of the New Teſtament are either Hiſtories or Epiſtles; the Hiſtories are the Four <hi>Goſpels</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> The Four <hi>Goſpels</hi> were written by the Four <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> whoſe Names they bear; of whom St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> were Eye-Witneſſes of what they wrote, but St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> had what they wrote from the Relation of others.</p>
               <p>This Goſpel before us of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> contains an Hiſtory of the Birth, Life, Miracles, Death and Reſurrection of the Holy <hi>JESUS:</hi> All which are the moſt Stupendious and Amazing Matters, as well as the moſt Neceſſary Truths to be Known and Believed in the World: And,</p>
               <p>This Chapter before us contains the Genealogy or Pedigree of our Saviour <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> as he was Man, unto <hi>Verſ. 17.</hi> and then relates the Fact of his Wonderful Incarnation, to the End of the Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">1 THE book of the generation of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſon of David, the ſon of Abraham.</p>
               <p>Our Evangeliſt deſigning to write a Narrative of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Life, begins with his Pedigree and Genealogy, and ſhews whom he deſcended from, namely, from <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. That <hi>David</hi> is named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he being a King, and an Illuſtrious Type of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, and do to this day expect, that the Son of <hi>David</hi> ſhould reign over them; and that they ſhould enjoy a Temporal Kingdom by him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Names given to our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Christ; Jeſus</hi> is his <hi>Hebrew</hi> Name, and ſignifies a Saviour; <hi>Christ</hi> is his <hi>Greek</hi> Name, and ſignifies A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: From whence ſome do inferr an Intimation and Encouragement, that both <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> may alike come unto Chriſt for Life and Salvation; he being the common Saviour of both; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of St. <hi>John, Epist.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>He is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 Abraham begat Iſaac, and Iſaac begat Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren. 3 And Judas begat Pharez, and Zara of Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and Pharez begat Eſrom, and Eſrom begat Aram. 4 And Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naaſſon, and Naaſſon begat Salmon.</p>
               <p>Both the Evangeliſts, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> make mention of our Saviour's Pedigree; the former by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Father's Side, the latter by his Mother's Side: the deſign of both, was to preſent us with a general Draught of our Lord's Pedigree and Deſcent, and not to be ſtrict and accurate in enumerating every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This ſhould teach us, not to be over-curious in ſcanning the Parts of this Genealogy, much leſs captiouſly to object againſt it: For if the Evangeliſts were not critical and exact in compoſing this Genealogy, why ſhould we ſhew our ſelves ſo, in examining of it? Rather let us attend to the Deſign of the Holy Ghoſt in Writing of it, which was twofold: Firſt, For the Honour of our Saviour, as Man; ſhewing who were his Noble and Royal Progenitors accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh. Secondly, For the Confirmation of our Faith, touching the Reality of our Redeemer's Incarnation. The Scripture making mention of all his Progenitors, from the firſt Man <hi>Adam</hi> to his reputed Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> will not ſuffer us to doubt, either of the Truth of his Human Nature, or of the Certainty of his being the promiſed <hi>Meſſias. Learn hence,</hi> That the Wiſdom of God has taken all neceſſary Care, and uſed all needful Means for the ſatisfying the Minds of all unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Perſons touching the Reality of Chriſt's Human Nature, and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:6"/> the Certainty of his being the promiſed <hi>Meſſias:</hi> For both theſe Ends is our Saviour's Genealogy and Deſcent recorded in the Holy Scriptures.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Here are ſeveral Women mentioned in our Saviour's Genealogy, and all, or moſt of them, have a Brand of Infamy upon them. <hi>Thamar</hi> was one, with whom her Father-in-Law <hi>Judah</hi> committed <hi>Incest; Rachab</hi> is called <hi>an Harlot; Ruth</hi> came of <hi>Moab,</hi> whom <hi>Lot</hi> begat of his own <hi>Daughter;</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the Wife of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> was one with whom <hi>David</hi> had committed <hi>Adultery.</hi> Now the Wiſdom of God has thought fit to leave all this upon Record for ſeveral Ends and Purpoſes. 1. To denote the Freeneſs of God's Grace, which extends it ſelf in the Saving Effects and Benefits of it to them that are moſt unworthy, and ill-deſerving. 2. To encourage the greateſt Sinners to go unto Chriſt by Faith, and ſeek to be ingrafted into him: For as Chriſt by the Power of his Godhead did purifie our Nature from all the Pollution of his Anceſtors, ſo he can by the Power of his Grace and Spirit, Sanctifie our Perſons and Natures, how foul and impure ſoever they either are, or have been. 3. Hereby our Lord gives us to underſtand, That he came to Save the moſt Notorious Sinners, as well as thoſe, whoſe Lives have been leſs Scandalous. 4. This is recorded for the Support of ſuch as are Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and Baſe-born, how vile ſoever their Parent's Sin has rendered them in the Eyes of Men, 'tis their own Sin only which expoſes them to Contempt in the ſight of God. Tis not Illegitimacy, but Unregeneracy, that makes us Objects of God's Wrath.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Now the birth of Jeſus Chriſt was on this wiſe: When as his mother Mary was eſpouſed to Joſeph, (before they came together) ſhe was found with child of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>This Eſpouſal of <hi>Mary</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was for the Safety of <hi>Christ,</hi> and for the Credit and Reputation of the <hi>Virgin:</hi> It was for our Saviour's Safety, becauſe being to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he has <hi>Joſeph</hi> his reputed Father to take care of him; and it was for the Virgin's Reputation, leſt ſhe ſhould have been accounted unclean. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> What a ſpecial Regard Almighty God has to the Fame and Reputation of his Children; he would have them free from the leaſt Suſpicion of Evil and Diſhoneſty. <hi>Mary</hi> being eſpouſed to an Husband, frees her ſelf from the Suſpicion of Naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and her Son from the Imputation of an Illegitimate Birth. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The Miraculous Conception of the Holy <hi>Jeſus;</hi> the Holy Ghoſt overſhadowed the Virgin, and did miraculouſly cauſe her Conception without the help of an Human Father. Thus Chriſt was the Son of God as well in his Human, as in his Divine Nature: He muſt needs be a perfectly Holy Perſon, who was conceived purely by the Holy Spirit's Operation.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then Joſeph her husband, being a juſt man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>
               <p>That is, being an holy Perſon, he was unwilling to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a defiled Woman, and therefore minded <hi>to put her away;</hi> but being kind and gentle, he intended <hi>to put her away privily,</hi> leſt ſhe ſhould have been expoſed and ſtoned to death. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How early our Dear Lord's Sufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; he and his Mother are deſigned <hi>to be put away,</hi> even when he was but an <hi>Embryo</hi> in the Womb. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> From the great Clemency of <hi>Joſeph</hi> toward the ſuſpected Virgin, That kind and merciful Men always preſume the beſt, and proſecute with gentleneſs, eſpecially where Life is concerned. Meek <hi>Joſeph</hi> doth reſolve upon the milder courſe, and chooſes rather <hi>to put her away privily,</hi> than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to expoſe her.</p>
               <p n="20">20 But while he thought on theſe things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, ſaying, Joſeph thou ſon of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Two things are here <hi>obſervable;</hi> namely, the Care that Almighty God takes, 1. For <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Satisfaction. 2. For Vindicating the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s Reputation. For <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, an Angel is diſpatcht to give him aſſurance, that the <hi>Virgin</hi> was not defiled by Man, but overſhadowed by the Holy Ghoſt. Whence <hi>Note,</hi> That Almighty God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find out Ways and Means for his People's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when they are willing, and deſirous above all things, to come to the Knowledge and right Underſtanding of their Duty. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How the Angel clears the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin's Innocency, as well as ſatisfies <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Doubtings, by aſſuring, that what was conceived in her was by the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That God will in his own time clear the Innocency of ſuch as ſuffer in their Name and Reputation, for the ſake of Chriſt, tho' for the preſent, they may ly under the Burden of Diſgrace and Shame.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And ſhe ſhall bring forth a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus: for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. A Prediction of our Saviour's Birth; the Virgin <hi>ſhall bring forth a Son.</hi> 2. A Precept for the Impoſition of his Name; <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus,</hi> that is, a Saviour. 3. The Reaſon why that Name was given him; becauſe <hi>he ſhould ſave a People,</hi> not temporally, as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their Enemies; but ſpiritually and eternally, <hi>from their Sins;</hi> not <hi>in their Sins,</hi> but <hi>from them;</hi> that is, from the Guilt and Puniſhment, from the Power and Dominion of them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The peculiar Subjects of this Priviledge; <hi>His People: He ſhall ſave his People from their Sins. Learn,</hi> 1. That Sin is the Evil of Evils; or, that Sin conſidered in it ſelf, is incomparably the greateſt and the worſt of Evils. 2. That the great End of Chriſt's coming into the World, was to be a Saviour from this Evil. 3. That Chriſt's own People do want, and ſtand in need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as well as others; if he does not ſave them from their Sins, they muſt Die in, and for their Sins, as well as others.</p>
               <p n="22">22 (Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet, ſaying, 23 Behold a virgin ſhall be with child, and ſhall bring forth a ſon, and they ſhall call his name Emmanuel, which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, is, God with us.</p>
               <p>Of all the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> has the Honour to be firſt recited in the New. Here
<pb facs="tcp:46556:6"/> the Evangeliſt quotes his Prophecy of Chriſt's Incarnation. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall be with Child. Learn</hi> thence, That the great Myſtery of our Saviour's wonderful Incarnation, was (tho' darkly) revealed to the Church of God under the Old Teſtament. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, The Name given to our Saviour under the Old Teſtament, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that is, <hi>God with us:</hi> God manifeſted in our Fleſh; God appearing in our Nature; God reconciling Man to himſelf. Oh Happy and Bleſſed Union of Two Natures in One Perſon! Chriſt is God and Man united, that God and Men may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Then Joſeph being raiſed from ſleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> is no ſooner aſſured that <hi>Mary</hi> is with Child by the Overſhadowing Power of the Holy Ghoſt, but he inſtantly obeys the Lord's Command, and takes <hi>Mary</hi> to him, without farther diſputing or delaying. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That a Gracious Perſon, when once ſatisfied in God's Word of Command, diſputes no farther, but inſtantly complies with the Will of God, even in the moſt hazardous and difficult Duties.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And knew her not, till ſhe had brought forth her firſt-born ſon, and he called his Name Jeſus.</p>

                  </gap>uſly Believed, tho' not poſitively in Scripture Aſſerted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Virgin had no other Child but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; it is a very probable Opinion, tho' not an infallible Article of Faith, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would make it: For the word <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil</hi> ſignifies in Scripture, as much as Never. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. <hi>I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have promiſed;</hi> that is, <hi>I will never leave thee.</hi> So the Words following, <hi>Her first-born Son,</hi> do not imply that ſhe had any Child after; but that ſhe had none before. That Child which firſt openeth the Womb, is uſually in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called the Firſt-born, tho' there was no other born after. Thus <hi>Joſh.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Machir</hi> is called the Firſt-born of <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> tho' he had no more Children. So that Chriſt, not only as God, but alſo as he was Man, was the Firſt-born, and Only Son. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expounds and applies <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. <hi>v.</hi> 2. to the Virgin <hi>Mary; This Gate ſhall be ſhut, it ſhall not be opened, and no Man ſhall enter in by it; becauſe the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath entered in by it, therefore it ſhall be ſhut.</hi> And others of the Ancients ſay, That as Chriſt lay in the Tomb, in which none lay before himſelf, ſo he lodg'd in a Womb, in which none ever lay, either before or after himſelf.</p>

                  <p> Our Saviour's Miraculous Conception by the Power of the Holy Ghost, being recorded in the First Chapter; ſeveral remarkable Circumſtances relating to his Birth, are ſet down in this: As namely, the Place of his Birth, <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and the Time, <hi>In the days of</hi> Herod <hi>the King.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. The Place of our Lord's Birth, <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem;</hi> he was Born, not at <hi>Athens,</hi> not at <hi>Rome,</hi> not at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> not in any Opulent or Magnificent City, but in the meaneſt of the Cities of <hi>Judah:</hi> Thereby ſhewing us, that his Kingdom was not of this World, and that he little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Pomp and outward Greatneſs. Oh how can we be Abaſed enough for Chriſt, that thus Neglected himſelf for us? <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Time of our Lord's Birth, <hi>In the Days of</hi> Herod <hi>the King.</hi> This <hi>Herod</hi> being a Foreigner, and King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which now reigned over the <hi>Jews;</hi> in him was fulfilled <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>That the Scepter ſhould not depart from Judah;</hi> that is, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of their own Nation <hi>until Shiloh come:</hi> That is, until Chriſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> come in the Fleſh.

That Tribute of Honour which was paid unto our Saviour at his Birth; the Wiſe Men of the Eaſt came and Worſhipped him: That is, the <hi>Chaldean, Arabian,</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Aſtronomers, who as the Firſt-Fruits of the Gentiles, ſeek after Chriſt; whilſt the <hi>Jews</hi> his own People rejected him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Inquiry that they make after Chriſt; they do not ask <hi>whether</hi> he was Born, but <hi>where</hi> he was Born; not doubting of the Fact, but ignorant of the Place. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Ground of their Inquiry; <hi>For we have ſeen his Star:</hi> They had ſeen a Star, but how did they know it was his Star? Doubtleſs, by Divine Revelation, they had a Light within, as well as a Star without, or they had never found Chriſt: No doubt, the Holy Spirit's Illumination accompanied the Star's Apparition. As God made known the Birth of Chriſt to the <hi>Jews</hi> by an Angel, ſo he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the ſame to the Gentiles by a new-created Star. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The End of their Journey; <hi>We are come to Worſhip him;</hi> that is, to Pay all that Honour and Homage which is due to a Great and Mighty Prince: All that Adoration and Worſhip, which belongs to the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Redeemer of the World. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That all Honour and Homage, all Glory and Worſhip is due to Chriſt from the Sons of Men, and will be given him by thoſe that know him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When Herod the king heard <hi>theſe things,</hi> he was troubled, and all Jeruſalem with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> That when Chriſt came into the World to Save Men, it caſt the World into Conſternation, and cauſed wonderful Diſturbance. <hi>Herod</hi> is firſt concerned, and next, <hi>all</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with him; Herod</hi> for fear of loſing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for fear of loſing their Prince. Thus Chriſt, who was the Angel's Song, the Wiſe Men's Joy, <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Conſolation, becomes <hi>Herod</hi>'s Fear, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Terrour. But why was <hi>Herod</hi> thus diſturbed? 'Tis true, a King is Born, but one whoſe Kingdom is not of this World; 'twas <hi>Herod</hi>'s falſe Apprehenſion, that was the Cauſe of this Perturbation. Hence we ſee, that the greateſt Enmities, and bittereſt Animoſities, have ariſen from cauſleſs Fears, and groundleſs Jealouſies.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And when he had gathered all the chief prieſts and ſcribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Chriſt ſhould be born. 5 And they ſaid unto him, In Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet; 6 And thou Bethlehem <hi>in</hi> the land of Juda, art not the leaſt among the princes of Juda: for out of thee ſhall come a Governour, that ſhall rule my people Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> being in great Perplexity, conven'd a Council of the Chief Prieſts and Scribes, and demands of them the Place where Chriſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be Born; they readily reply out of the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> ch. 5.2. that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is the Place; this was the City of <hi>David</hi>'s Birth, and of Chriſt's the Son of <hi>David. Bethlehem</hi> ſignifies the Houſe of Bread, and was ſo called from its Fertility and Fruitfulneſs, and as ſome think, with Reference to Chriſt the True Bread of Life, Born there. <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was a mean and contemptible Place in it ſelf, but being Honoured with Chriſt's Preſence, how great is it? <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the Preſence of Chriſt dignifies and exalts a Place, how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in it ſelf. <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> tho' a little City in it ſelf, yet is not the leaſt amongſt the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe Chriſt is Born there.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wiſe men, inquired of them diligently what time the ſtar appeared: 8 And he ſent them to Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, and ſaid, Go and ſearch diligently for
<pb facs="tcp:46556:7"/> the young child, and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How <hi>Herod</hi> cloaks his intended Cruelty, with diſguiſed Hypocriſie; he had Murder in his Heart, when he pretended to Worſhip Chriſt with his Mouth. There is no Villany ſo great, but will mask it ſelf under a Pretence and Shew of Piety. <hi>Herod</hi> veils his Intent to Kill Chriſt, with a Pretence to Worſhip him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Herod</hi> calls him <hi>the young Child,</hi> not <hi>the young King;</hi> that Word was too big to come out of <hi>Herod</hi>'s proud Mouth, he could neither bear the Thing, nor brook the Title. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. How craftily <hi>Herod</hi> lays his Plot; he deſires the Wiſe Men to inquire tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, and to inform him privately. To be Wiſe in doing Miſchief, is the worſt Wiſdom in the World: 'Tis not the Wiſdom from above, but from Hell beneath.</p>
               <p n="9">9 When they had heard the king, they departed, and lo, the ſtar which they ſaw in the eaſt, went before them, till it came, and ſtood over where the young child was. 10 When they ſaw the ſtar, they rejoyced with exceeding great joy. 11 And when they were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe, they ſaw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worſhipped him: and when they had opened their treaſures, they preſented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincenſe, and myrrh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Star, which for ſome time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, now appears again, to their farther Direction in finding Chriſt: <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That God will not be wanting to ſuch as are on the Way to ſeek Chriſt, but will renew Directions and Encouragements to them, according as they ſtand in need; none ever ſincerely ſought Chriſt, but they certainly found him at the laſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That the Joy which ariſes in ſuch a Soul as has found Chriſt, is unutterable and unſpeakable; the Wiſe Men here <hi>Rejoyced with Joy, with great Joy, with exceeding great Joy. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Wiſe Men having found this young King, they bring Preſents to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the Eaſtern Countries; namely, Gold, Frankincenſe, and Myrrh, which were the principal Commodities of the Eaſt: But the beſt Preſent we can make to Chriſt, is our Selves; he ſeeks not Ours, but Us; and rather deſires what we are, than what we have. Yet the Providence of God was wonderfully ſeen in theſe Preſents, for hereby Proviſion was made for the Suſtenance of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Child <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in their Exile, or Flight into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which they were ſhortly to undergo.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And being warned of God in a dream, that they ſhould not return to Herod, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted into their own countrey another way.</p>
               <p>God having warned the Wiſe Men in a Dream, not to go back to <hi>Herod,</hi> they return home another way. But did theſe Wiſe Men play the Parts of Honeſt Men, in that they returned not again to <hi>Herod? Anſw.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not that they promiſed <hi>Herod</hi> to return, tho' he expected it; or if they did, it was, in conſideration that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould Come and Worſhip Chriſt, not Murther and Deſtroy him: But if they promiſed him never ſo poſitively, God Almighty gave them a Diſpenſation from that Promiſe, by commanding them to return home another way. <hi>Herod</hi> kept his Deſign againſt Chriſt cloſe from the Wiſe Men, but he could not conceal his Intentions from the infinitely Wiſe God; he knew the Purpoſes of his Heart, and by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, kept Chriſt out of his Hand: There is no Wiſdom, nor Underſtanding, nor Counſel againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joſeph in a dream, ſaying, Ariſe, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod will ſeek the young child to deſtroy him. 14 When he aroſe, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt 15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet, ſaying, Out of Egypt have I called my Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. How our Lord himſelf in a time of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flies for Safety, who was able a thouſand ways to have preſerv'd himſelf from Danger: <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That in times of Difficulty and Danger, 'tis neither unwarrantable nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming, to preſerve our Lives by flight; ſurely 'tis no Shame for us to fly, when our Captain doth both practiſe it, and command it alſo. Chriſt by his own Example has ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified that State of Life unto us, and by his Command has made it lawful for us. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Place which Chriſt flies unto for Safety, and that is <hi>Egypt;</hi> an unlikely Place, conſidered in it ſelf: Who could expect Liberty in that Houſe of Bondage? But any Place is good, if God ſends us thither, and Chriſt be in our company, his Preſence can make <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf not only ſafe, but delightful alſo. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. How readily <hi>Joſeph</hi> complies with the Divine Command; inſtantly <hi>He aroſe, and took the young Child, and fled. Teaching us,</hi> That when our Direction is clear, our Compliance ſhould be ſpeedy: We cannot be too forward and expeditious, in the Execution of Divine Commands. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Tho' <hi>Joſeph</hi> at the Command of God, flies preſently from <hi>Herod</hi>'s Rage, yet he flies privately, by Night, and prudentially begins his Journey when leaſt Notice ſhould be taken of his Motion: <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That altho' we have never ſo many Promiſes of Safety and Deliverance, yet we muſt not put God up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Working Miracles for our Preſervation, when it may be obtained in the Uſe of Means.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then Herod, when he ſaw that he was mocked of the wiſe men, was exceeding wroth, and ſent forth, and ſlew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coaſts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wiſe men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> How <hi>Herod</hi> having play'd the Fox before, he acts the Lion now; his ſecret Policy not ſucceeding, he breaks out into open and inhumane Cruelty. <hi>Learn,</hi> That when Fraud and Subtilty fail the Enemies of the Church, they then fall to open Rage and barbarous Inhumanity: Thus here, theſe Holy Innocents fall, as a Sacrifice to <hi>Herod</hi>'s Rage, and Die for Chriſt, who came to Die for them; and ſo were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Deed, tho' not in Will. Some affirm, that <hi>Herod</hi> did not ſpare his own Child then at Nurſe in the Coaſts of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> which made <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſay, He had rather be <hi>Herod</hi>'s Hog, than <hi>Herod</hi>'s Child; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> did kill and eat no Swine's Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Jeremy the prophet, ſaying, 18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning: Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The loud and bitter Cry which the Mothers of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> make for the Death of their innocent Children, which were barbarouſly ſlain by the Sword of <hi>Herod:</hi> Here was Lamentation, Weeping, and great Mourning made by <hi>Rachel,</hi> that is, by the Women inhabiting in and about <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Sepulcher was; for the Land about <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was called <hi>Rachel,</hi> from her Sepulcher, ſo famous in thoſe Parts. <hi>Rachel</hi> here is not the Name of a Perſon, but of a Place. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Cauſe and Reaſon of this Cry, and bitter Lamentation; the Mothers weep, not becauſe their Children are, but becauſe they are not; they did not with ſome wicked Parents, repine becauſe they had Children, but becauſe they had loſt them: Mothers have the ſharpeſt Throws both in their Childrens Births and Burials. As Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their Births, are their Mothers <hi>Benjamins;</hi> ſo in their Burial, they are their Mothers <hi>Benoni's,</hi> Sons of Sorrow.</p>
               <p n="19">19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joſeph
<pb facs="tcp:46556:7"/> in Egypt, ſaying, 20 Ariſe, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Iſrael: for they are dead which ſought the young child's life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death, like a Bloody Perſecutor, he is ſent unlamented to his Grave; Hiſtorians ſay, that out of his Body iſſued forth ſuch impure Streams of Blood, that the Loathſomneſs and Pain made him attempt the killing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God ſeldom ſuffers Perſecutors to paſs in quiet to their Graves; they rarely die the common Death of all Men, having no other Balm at their Funeral, than their own Blood. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The happy Conſequent of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death, Chriſt is now call'd Home without Danger; <hi>Herod</hi> being ſent to his Grave, the Coaſt is clear for the Return of the Holy Family: The Death of Perſecutors, is the Delivery of the Perſecuted.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And he aroſe, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Iſrael. 22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea, in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithſtanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aſide into the parts of Galilee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The juſt Fear that <hi>Joſeph</hi> has upon his Mind, that <hi>Herod</hi>'s Son would be as Bloody a Tyrant as his Flagitious Father. No wonder, that the Children of Cruel Perſecutors are ſuſpected to tread in their Bloody Parents Steps. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How God's Warrant and Direction doth quiet <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Mind, reſolve his Doubts, and remove his Fears, and makes him readily comply with the Command of God; <hi>Being warned of God, he removes out of</hi> Egypt <hi>into</hi> Galilee. Oh how ſafe and ſatisfactory is it, in all our Ways to follow the Call and Command of God! <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> durſt not move their Feet, no not out of <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf, till God gives them a Warrant for their departure, and bids them go.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet, He ſhall be called a Nazarene.</p>
               <p>A threefold Interpretation is given of theſe Words, <hi>He ſhall be called a</hi> Nazarene. Some read the Words, 1. <hi>He ſhall be called a</hi> Nazarite; the <hi>Nazarites</hi> were a Religious and Separate Rank of Perſons among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who abſtained from Wine, and came not near the Dead for fear of Pollution: Chriſt was a Holy Perſon, but no <hi>Nazarite</hi> in a ſtrict ſence; for he drank Wine, and touched the Dead. 2. Others read the Words, <hi>He ſhall be called</hi> Netzer, a Branch, in Alluſion to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1. where he is called a <hi>Branch of the Root of</hi> Jeſſe. Chriſt was that True Branch, of which the Prophets had ſo often ſpoken. 3. Others will have the Word <hi>Nazarene</hi> referr to the City <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where Chriſt was conceived, and lived moſt of his time: <hi>He ſhall be called a</hi> Nazarene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dwelt at <hi>Nazareth;</hi> hence his Diſciples were called the Sect of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> that is, the Followers of him that dwelt at <hi>Nazareth;</hi> and Chriſt himſelf is pleaſed to own the Title, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.8. <hi>I am</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>whom thou perſecutest. Learn from hence,</hi> The great Humility of Mind that was found in our Saviour: He was Born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a little City; he Lives at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a poor contemptible Place: He aſpires not after the Grandeur of the World, but is meek and lowly in Spirit; may the ſame humble Mind be in us, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> This Evangelist having declared our Saviour's Miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, in the First Chapter, and recorded ſeveral remarkable Circumſtances relating to his Birth, in the Second Chapter; in this Chapter before us, he paſſes over in ſilence the whole Courſe of our Saviour's Life in private; taking no notice how he ſpent his Minority whilst he dwelt at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which was till he was Thirty Years old; at which time he entred upon his Publick Miniſtry, having <hi>John</hi> the Baptist for his Harbinger and Forerunner; at this Chapter fully informs us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 IN thoſe days came John the Baptiſt, preaching in the wilderneſs of Judea, 2 And ſaying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Preacher ſent by God, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt a Pattern of Mortification, and a Preacher of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Place he is ſent to Preach in, <hi>The Wilderneſs of</hi> Judea; not in Populous <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Wilderneſs, where Inhabitants were ſew, and probably very ignorant and rude. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to ſend forth the Preachers of the Goſpel, when and whither, and to what People he pleaſes; and none muſt Aſſume the Office before they be Sent. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that he preaches, namely, the Doctrine of Repentance, <hi>Repent ye:</hi> This was to prepare the People for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Grace of the Goſpel. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the Preaching of the Doctrine of Repentance is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to the preparing of the Hearts of Sinners for the receiving of Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Motive which St. <hi>John</hi> uſes to inforce the Exhortation to Repentance, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> that is, now is the ſo much expected Time of the Appearing of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> come; the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation is now to be Aboliſhed, and the Mercy and Grace of the Goſpel is now to be Revealed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Repent, and Amend your Lives. <hi>Note thence,</hi> That the free and full Tenders of Grace and Mercy in the Goſpel, are the moſt alluring Arguments to move a Sinner to Repent, and to Convert to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For this is he that was ſpoken of by the prophet Eſaias, ſaying, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> from <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's living in the Wilderneſs, would make him the firſt Founder of the Order of the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> but very groundleſly. For, 1. What he did, was by God's Command; what they do, is by the Dictates of their their own Fancy. 2. He buſied himſelf in Preaching in the Wilderneſs; they bury themſelves alive, and do nothing. 3. He lived in the Wilderneſs but for a time, afterwards we find him at Court, Preaching a Sermon to <hi>Herod;</hi> but they bind themſelves with a Vow, to live and die <hi>Hermits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 And the ſame John had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his meat was locuſts and wild honey.</p>
               <p>The plaineſs of <hi>John</hi>'s Habit and Diet, is here declared; he was habited in a plain Suit of Camels Hair, much as <hi>Elijah</hi> was, before him; and as his Habit was plain, ſo his Diet was ordinary, feeding upon Herbs, and ſuch Things as the Wilderneſs affords; hence it was that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaid he was all Voice; a Voice in his Habit, a Voice in his Diet, and a Voice in his whole Converſation: His Example <hi>Teaches us,</hi> That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are not to affect Bravery in Apparel, or Delicacy in Diet; but having the neceſſary Comforts, and needful Conveniencies of Life, to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Then went out to him Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> The great Encouragement, which <hi>John</hi> had in his Miniſtry, from the People's Attendance upon it; he was now Fiſhing for Souls, and God brought the People very thick about the Net of the Goſpel, and multitudes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is matter of great Rejoicing to the Miniſters of Chriſt, when they find their People for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to encourage their Miniſtry by a diligent Attendance.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their ſins.</p>
               <p>This Place the <hi>Papiſts</hi> bring to ſupport their Doctrine of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> but very groundleſly: For, 1. The Conſeſſion of thoſe Converts was voluntary, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. 2. It was general, and not of every particular Sin. 3. It was publick and open, not in the Ear of a Prieſt. <hi>Note,</hi> That Confeſſion of Sin paſt, together with a Profeſſion
<pb facs="tcp:46556:8"/> of Faith in, and Obedience to Chriſt for the time to come, are neceſſary Requiſites and Qualifications in all Perſons of riper years that are admitted to Baptiſm; <hi>John</hi> admitted theſe Perſons to Baptiſm, upon their Confeſſion of Sin, and Promiſe of Amendment.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But when he ſaw many of the Phariſees and Sadduces come to his baptiſm, he ſaid unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come. 8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance. 9 And think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have Abraham to our father: for I ſay unto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Entertainment which <hi>John</hi> gave to his unexpected Auditors, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> which came to Hear him, and to be Baptized by him: He gives them, firſt a quick and cutting Compellation, <hi>Oh Generation of Vipers;</hi> next, a ſharp and ſevere Reprehenſion, <hi>Who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come?</hi> It was matter of Wonder and Admiration, to ſee ſuch Men turn Proſelytes. <hi>Note thence;</hi> That the Condition of proud <hi>Phariſees,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and falſe-hearted Hypocrites, tho' it be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, yet is not hopeleſs and deſperate; and their Salvation, tho' very improbable, yet muſt not be deſpaired of as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: And accordingly, the Baptiſt having given them a ſmart Reproof, ſubjoins a ſeaſonable Exhortation, <hi>Bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Do not ſatisfie your ſelves with a bare Profeſſion of Repentance, but let us ſee the Fruits of Repentance in your daily Converſation. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That ſincere Repentance is not a barren thing, but conſtantly brings forth the Fruits of Holineſs anſwerable to its Nature: As the Body without the Spirit, and as Faith without Works is dead, ſo Repentance without Fruits is dead alſo. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> How he enforces his Exhortation, with a neceſſary Caution; <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Truſt not to your outward Priviledges, and glory not in them; flatter not your ſelves, that becauſe you are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the only Viſible Church, that therefore the Judgments of God will not reach you; for God can out of the obdurate Gentile World raiſe up a People to himſelf, and take them into Covenant with himſelf, and caſt you all out. Now from St. <hi>John</hi>'s plain-dealing with theſe Hypocritical <hi>Phariſees,</hi> we <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is the Duty, and ought to be the Endeavour of the Miniſters of Chriſt, to drive Hypocrites from their vain Confidence, who do conſtantly bear up themſelves upon their External Priviledges, in the Enjoyment of which, they promiſe themſelves a freedom from the Judgments of God. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And now alſo the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and caſt into the fire.</p>
               <p>The Baptiſt had preacht the Doctrine of Repentance in the former Verſes, he backs it with a powerful Motive in this Verſe; drawn from the Certainty, the Severity and Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Vengeance which would come upon them, if they continued impenitent: <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the Root of the Trees. Learn,</hi> 1. That thoſe whoſe Hearts are not pierced with the Sword of God's Word, ſhall certainly be cut down and deſtroyed by the Ax of his Judgments. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That it is not unſuitable for Goſpel-Preachers to preſs Repentance and Holineſs of Life upon their Hearers, from Arguments of Terrour; <hi>John</hi> does it here, and Chriſt elſewhere. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> That foraſmuch as the Sin here ſpecified is a Sin of Omiſſion, which brings this ſore and ſevere Judgment; <hi>Every Tree that bringeth not forth Good Fruit,</hi> as well as that which bringeth forth Evil Fruit, <hi>is hewn down and cast into the Fire;</hi> we may gather, That Sins of Omiſſion are certainly Damning, as well as Sins of Commiſſion; the Neglects of Duty as are dangerous and damnable, as the Acts of Sin: Such Trees as ſtand in God's Orchard and bring forth no Good Fruit, are markt out as Fuel for the Devil's Fire.</p>
               <p n="11">11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear: he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</p>
               <p>In theſe Words <hi>John</hi> declares the Excellency of Chriſt's Perſon and Miniſtry above his own: As to his Perſon, he owns that he was not worthy to carry his Shoes after him, or to perform the loweſt Offices of Service for him: And as to his Office, he declares that Chriſt ſhould not Baptize as he did, with Water, but with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire; that is, ſhould plentifully pour down of the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit upon his Proſelytes, which like Fire in their Operation ſhould purifie their Hearts from Sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming their Luſts and Corruptions; but at the ſame time he has a Fiery Indignation and Flaming Judgments, to deſtroy and burn up Impenitent Sinners, like combuſtible Stubble. <hi>Where obſerve,</hi> How Chriſt is repreſented by one and the ſame Metaphor of Fire, in a way of Comfort to his Children, and in a way of Terrour to his Enemies; he is a Fire unto both: He ſits in his Church as a Refiner's Fire, he is amongſt his Enemies as a Conſuming Fire; a Fire for his Church to take Comfort in, a Fire for his Enemies to Periſh by.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Whoſe fan is in his hand, and he will thorowly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner: but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>
               <p>In theſe Words, the Baptiſt compares Chriſt the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to an Husbandman, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church to a Barn-Floor; the Office of the Husbandman is to Threſh, Fan, and Winnow his Corn, ſeparating it from the Chaff; preſerving the one, and conſuming the other. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Church is Chriſt's Floor. 2. That this Floor Chriſt will Purge, and that throughly. 3. That the Word of Chriſt is the Fan in his Hands, by and with which, he will thoroughly Purge his Floor: The Church is compared to a Floor, upon the Account of that Mixture which is in the Church; in a Floor there is Straw as well as Grain, Chaff as well as Corn; Tares as well as Wheat, Cockle and Darnel, as well as Good Seed: Thus in the Church there is, and will be a Mixture of Good and Bad, Saints and Sinners, Hypocrites and Sincere Chriſtians. But this Floor Chriſt will <hi>Purge;</hi> Purge it, but not Break it up; Purge out its Corruptions, but not Deſtroy its Eſſence and Exiſtence; and the Fan with which he will Purge his Floor, is his Word, accompanied with the Wing of Diſcipline: The Fan detects and diſcovers the Chaff, and the Wing diſſipates and ſcatters it; and by the help of both, the Floor is Purged. <hi>His Fan is in his Hand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then cometh Jeſus from Galilee to Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan unto John, to be baptized of him:</p>
               <p>Here we have our Saviour's Solemn Inauguration, and Publick Entrance upon his Prophetick Office by Baptiſm, or Waſhing with Water, according to the Manner of the Prieſts under the Ceremonial Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.4. Where we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> 1. The Circumſtance of Time; <hi>Then cometh Jeſus;</hi> that is, after he had lain hid in <hi>Nazareth</hi> Thirty Years, he comes abroad, and enters upon his Publick Miniſtry. <hi>Teaching us</hi> by his Example, That when we are ripe and fit for Publick Service, we ſhould no leſs willingly leave our Obſcurity, than we took the Benefit of it, for our Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Action it ſelf. Chriſt is <hi>Baptized</hi> now, as he was <hi>Circumciſed</hi> before; not becauſe there was any Impurity in him, either Filth, or Foreskin, which wanted either the Circumciſing-Knife, or the Baptiſmal-Water; yet Purity it ſelf condeſcends to be Waſhed, Chriſt to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; for theſe Reaſons: 1. That by this Symbol he might enter himſelf into the Society of Chriſtians, as by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion he had done into the Society of <hi>Jews;</hi> as a King condeſcends ſometimes to be made a Freeman of a City or Corporation. 2. That he might by his own Baptiſm Sanctifie the Ordinance of Baptiſm unto his Church. 3. That thereby he might fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Ceremonial Law, which required the Waſhing of the Prieſts in Water, when they entred upon their Office, as appears from <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The great Dignation and Condeſcention of Chriſt, in ſeeking and ſubmitting to the Baptiſm of <hi>John. Christ cometh to</hi> John, not <hi>John</hi> to Chriſt. Behold! the Lord ſeeking to his Servant, Chriſt will be Baptized of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger: Our Saviour's Deſign hereby no doubt was, to put
<pb facs="tcp:46556:8"/> Honour upon the Miniſtry of <hi>John.</hi> Oh how dare the Greateſt upon Earth deſpiſe the Miniſtry of Man, being appointed by God, which Chriſt honoured in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and graced with his own Preſence!</p>
               <p n="14">14 But John forbad him, ſaying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. The Modeſty of <hi>John</hi>'s Refuſal; <hi>John forbad him,</hi> and refuſed to admit him: But why? 1. In regard of Chriſt, becauſe he knew he needed it not; ſuch was his Majeſty and Greatneſs, that he was above it; and ſuch was his Purity and Holineſs, that he could not want it. 2. In reſpect of himſelf, he knew his own Uncleanneſs; <hi>I have need to be Baptized of thee,</hi> &amp;c. He thought it unſuitable, that a Sinner ſhould Baptize and Waſh him that was no Sinner. 3. With reſpect to the People; leſt they ſeeing Chriſt Baptized, ſhould apprehend him to be a Sinner, and one that wanted the Baptiſm of Repentance, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. As the Modeſty of <hi>John</hi>'s Refuſal, ſo the Reaſon he aſſigns for it; <hi>I have need to be Baptized of thee:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Thou art Purity, I am Pollution; thou art Spirit, I am Fleſh: Thou are the Son of God, I am the Son of <hi>Adam:</hi> Such an humble Apprehenſion has this Holy Man of himſelf. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the more Holy a Perſon is, the more ſenſible he is of his Unholineſs; where there is moſt Grace, there is the greateſt ſenſe of the want of Grace.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto him, Suffer it to be ſo now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteouſneſs: Then he ſuffered him.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words contain our Saviour's Reaſon, why he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, becauſe it became him to fulfil all Righteouſneſs; that is, particularly the Righteouſneſs of the Ceremonial Law, which required the Waſhing of the Prieſts in Water, when they entred upon their Office, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That whatever the Law required, in order to perfect Righteouſneſs, that Chriſt fulfilled in moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Perfection; both in his own Perſon, and alſo in the Name of all Believers. 2. That as it became Chriſt to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Ceremonial Law for himſelf, ſo it is our Duty and Intereſt to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Moral Law for our ſelves, as an Evidence of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteous in God's Sight, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous, even as he is righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 And Jeſus when he was baptized, went up ſtraightway out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a dove, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him. 17 And lo, a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Here we have the ſolemn Inveſting of Chriſt into his Office, accompanied with a threefold Miracle. 1. The Opening of the Heavens. 2. The Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt in the likeneſs of a Dove. 3. God the Father's Voice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Son. The Heavens were opened, to ſhew, that Heaven which was cloſed and ſhut againſt us for our Sins, is now opened to us, by Chriſt's Undertaking for us. As the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhuts us out of Heaven, the Second <hi>Adam</hi> lets us into it; he opened Heaven to us by his Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſion, and he keeps it open by his Prevailing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. Next, the Holy Ghoſt deſcends like a Dove upon our Saviour; here we have an Evidence of the Bleſſed Trinity; the Father ſpeaks from Heaven, the Son comes out of the Water, and the Holy Ghoſt appears in the likeneſs of a Dove. <hi>Hence we gather,</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt is not a Quality, or an Operation, but a Perſon; and a Perſon really diſtinct from the Father and the Son. But why did the Holy Spirit now deſcend upon Chriſt? <hi>First,</hi> For the Deſignation of his Perſon, to ſhew that Chriſt was the Perſon ſet apart for the Work and Office of a Mediator. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Qualification of his Perſon, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Office. This was Chriſt's Unction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. when he was Anointed above his Fellows, to be the King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church. <hi>Last of all,</hi> We have the audible Voice of God the Father, pronouncing, 1. The Nearneſs of Chriſt's Relation to himſelf, <hi>This is my Son.</hi> 2. The Endearedneſs of his Perſon, This is <hi>my Beloved</hi> Son. 3. The Fruit and Benefit of this near and dear Relation unto us, <hi>In him I am well pleaſed. Note,</hi> 1. That there is no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for any Perſon to pleaſe God out of Chriſt: both our <hi>Perſons</hi> and our <hi>Performances,</hi> find <hi>Acceptance</hi> only for His ſake. 2. That in and through <hi>Christ,</hi> God is well-pleaſed with all <hi>Believers: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The former part of this Chapter acquaints us with our Bleſſed Saviour's Combat with, and Conquest over Satan; and the first Verſe informs us of the Time when, and Place where the Combat was fought.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THEN was Jeſus led up of the Spirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Time when Chriſt entred the Liſts with Satan, implied in the word <hi>Then;</hi> that is, Firſt, Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his Baptiſm; he is no ſooner out of the Water of Baptiſm, but he is in the Fire of Temptation. Secondly, Immediately after the Spirit deſcended upon him, and the Father had by a Voice from Heaven manifeſted his Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Satisfaction in him, <hi>This is my Beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Note thence,</hi> That great Manifeſtations of Love from God, are uſually followed with great Temptations from Satan. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The Place where this Combat was fought, and that is, <hi>in the Wilderneſs. Learn thence,</hi> That no Place can pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge us from Temptation, or be a Sanctuary from Satan's Aſſaults; the ſolitary Wilderneſs has a Tempter in it, yea, Satan ſometimes makes uſe of Mens Solitarineſs, to farther his Temptations; a Cell, a Nunnery, or a Cloiſter, are as open to Satan, as the open Fields; and the Perſons that live in them, have a Tempter without, and an Enticer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as well as other Men. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Efficient Cauſe of Chriſt's going into the Wilderneſs to be Tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; <hi>He was led up of the Spirit,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew; The Spirit drove him,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Mark:</hi> That is, the Holy Spirit of God, not Satan the Unclean Spirit; for the Devil is ſeldom, if ever called <hi>The Spirit,</hi> but uſually ſome Brand of Reproach is annexed, as the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirit.</hi> Chriſt was <hi>Led by the Spirit;</hi> that is, he was carried by a ſtrong Impulſe of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God into the Wilderneſs, to be Tempted by <hi>Satan. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That none of the Children of God ought to expect a Freedom from Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſeeing Chriſt himſelf, in the Days of his Fleſh, was ſtrongly ſolicited by <hi>Satan</hi> unto Sin. 2. That all the Temptations wherewith the Children of God are aſſaulted, are ordered by Divine and Special Diſpenſation. Satan could not aſſault our Saviour, till he was <hi>Led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs</hi> for that End; and he ſhall not aſſault any of his Members, but by Divine Permiſſion and ſpecial Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And when he had faſted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. How the Divine Power upheld the Human Nature of Chriſt without Food. What <hi>Moſes</hi> did at the Giving of the Law, Chriſt doth at the Beginning of the Goſpel, namely, <hi>Faſt Forty Days and Forty Nights.</hi> Chriſt hereby intended our Admiration, not our Imitation; or if our Imitation, of the Action only, not of the Time. Chriſt teaches us, by Faſting and Prayer to prepare our ſelves for a Conflict with our Spiritual Enemies; as he prepared himſelf by Faſting to grapple with the Tempter, ſo ſhould we.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And when the tempter came to him, he ſaid, If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Occaſion of the Temptation. 2. The Temptation it ſelf. The Occaſion was our Saviour's Hunger, and want of Bread. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That when God ſuffers any of his Dear Children to fall into Want, and to be ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Outward Things, Satan takes a mighty Advantage thereupon, to Tempt and Aſſault them. But what doth he Tempt our Saviour to? To the Sin of Diſtruſt, to queſtion his Sonſhip; <hi>If thou be the Son of God:</hi> And next, to diſtruſt his Father's Providence and Care, <hi>Command that theſe Stones
<pb facs="tcp:46556:9"/> be made Bread. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Satan's grand Deſign is, firſt, to tempt the Children of God to doubt of their Adoption; and next, to Diſtruſt God's Fatherly Care over them, and Proviſion for them; and laſt of all, to uſe Unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Means to help themſelves. Thus Satan dealt with Chriſt, and thus he deals with Chriſtians: For to work a Miracle at Satan's Direction; was not a Lawful Means of providing Food for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But he anſwered and ſaid, It is written, Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Weapon which our Saviour made uſe of to repell the Temptation, and to vanquiſh the Tempter; and that is the Word of God, <hi>It is written. Learn,</hi> That the Scriptures, or the Written Word of God, is the only ſure Weapon wherewith to vanquiſh Satan, and to beat back all his Fiery Temptations.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and ſetteth him on a pinacle of the temple,</p>
               <p>That is, Satan by God's permiſſion took up his Body and carried it in the Air, and ſet it upon one of the Battlements of the Temple. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. What a mighty Power Evil Spirits have over our Bodies, if God permits them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and exerciſe their Power upon them. 2. That it is owing to the gracious Care, and watchful Providence of God over us, that we are not hurried away bodily by Satan. Thanks be to God, tho' the Devil's Malice be infinite, yet his Power is limited and bounded; as he cannot do all the Miſchief he would to the Bodies and Souls of Men, ſo he ſhall not do all he can.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And ſaith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down: for it is written, He ſhall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</p>
               <p>Here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> Firſt, the <hi>Sin</hi> which Satan tempts Chriſt unto; and next, the Argument, which he tempts him from: The Sin tempted to, is the Sin of Self-Murther, <hi>Cast thy ſelf down.</hi> Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That Self-Murther is a Sin which Chriſt himſelf was, and the beſt of Saints may, by Satan be tempted to the Commiſſion of. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Satan tempted Chriſt to murther himſelf, but had not power to do it himſelf; do thou <hi>cast thy ſelf down:</hi> We <hi>Learn,</hi> That tho' Satan may tempt, yet he cannot compel; he may entice, but cannot enforce any to Sin, againſt their own Conſent. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Argument which Satan uſes, it is a Scripture-Argument; he quotes the Promiſe of God, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee.</hi> What a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel is here, to find Satan with a Bible under his Arm, and a Text of Scripture in his Mouth? Chriſt had alledged Scripture before to Satan, here Satan retorts Scripture back again to Chriſt: <hi>It is written,</hi> ſays Chriſt; <hi>It is written,</hi> ſays Satan. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is no wonder, to hear Hereticks and Hypocrites quote Scripture, when Satan himſelf durſt recite them: He that had prophanely toucht the Sacred Body of Chriſt with his Hand, ſticks not preſumptuouſly to handle the Holy Scriptures of God with his Tongue. <hi>Yet Obſerve,</hi> How wretchedly the Devil wreſts, perverts, and miſapplies the Scriptures: When God promiſes his Angels ſhall keep us, it is <hi>in Viis, non in Praecipitiis,</hi> 'tis in all God's Ways, not in any of our own crooked Paths. <hi>Note here,</hi> That altho' the Children of God have the Promiſe of the Guardianſhip of Holy Angels, yet then only may they expect their Protection, when they are walking in the Way of their Duty.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Jeſus ſaid unto him, It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> Tho' the Devil had wreſted and abuſed Scripture, yet ſtill Chriſt alledges Scripture. The Abuſe of the Holy Scriptures by Hereticks and Seducers, is no Argument againſt the Uſe of them: As Chriſt here compares <hi>Scripture</hi> with <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſo ſhould we, in order to the finding out the true <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and ſheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them: 9 And ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Sin</hi> which Satan tempts our Saviour to, is the <hi>Sin</hi> of Idolatry, even to Worſhip the Devil himſelf. Oh thou Impudent and Foul <hi>Spirit!</hi> To deſire thy Creator to Adore thee an Apoſtate-Creature! Surely there can be no <hi>Sin</hi> ſo black and foul, ſo groſs and monſtrous, but that the Chriſtian may be tempted to it, when Chriſt himſelf was tempted to Worſhip the Tempter. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> reads the Words, <hi>If thou wilt fall down and Worſhip me;</hi> St. <hi>Luke, If thou wilt Worſhip before me.</hi> Whence we may <hi>gather,</hi> That if to Worſhip before the Devil, be to Worſhip the Devil; then to Worſhip before an Image, is to Worſhip the Image. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Bait which Satan makes uſe of to allure our Saviour to the Sin of Idolatry; and that was, in repreſenting to his Eye and View all the Glories of the World in the moſt inviting manner, and that in a Moment of Time; to the intent it might affect him the more, and prevail the ſooner. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the Pomp and Greatneſs, the Glory and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of this World, is made uſe of by Satan, as a dangerous Snare to draw Men to a Compliance with him, in his Temptations unto Sin.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Then ſaith Jeſus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. With what Zeal and Indignation of Spirit, our Bleſſed Saviour repells and beats back this Temptation of Satan, <hi>Get thee hence. Note thence,</hi> That the greater the Sins are which the Devil tempts us to, the greater our Zeal and Indignation ought to be in oppoſing and reſiſting of the Temptation to them. A great Temptation muſt be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with great Reſolution. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Weapon with which he repells and beats back the Fiery Dart of Satan's Temptation, and that is with the Shield of Scripture: <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God. Learn thence,</hi> That GOD is the Sole Object of all Religious Worſhip; it is ſo peculiarly the Creator's Due, that to give it to any Creature, is groſs Idolatry, and repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and miniſtred unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Iſſue of this Combat, Satan is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and quits the Field; <hi>Then the Devil leaveth him. Teaching us,</hi> That nothing like a vigorous Reſiſtance of Temptation, cauſes the Tempter to flee from us; <hi>Reſist the Devil, and be will flee from you. Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Lord's Triumph over his Enemy; <hi>Behold, Angels came and miniſtred unto him;</hi> Food to his hungry Body, and Comfort to his tempted Soul. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That thoſe who in the Hour of Temptation do hold out in reſiſting Satan, ſhall find the Power and Faithfulneſs of God will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, to ſend in Succour and Relief in the End.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Now when Jeſus had heard that John was caſt into priſon, he departed into Galilee. 13 And leaving Nazareth, he came, and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the ſea-coaſt, in the borders of Zebulon and Nephthalim: 14 That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Eſaias the prophet, ſaying, 15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the ſea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: 16 The people which ſat in darkneſs, ſaw great light: and to them which ſat in the region and ſhadow of death, light is ſprung up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Our Saviour hearing of <hi>John</hi>'s Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, provides for his own Safety by departing into <hi>Galilee.</hi> As our Holy Lord avoided Perſecution, ſo may we. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The Place in <hi>Galilee</hi> he comes to, <hi>Capernaum:</hi> Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:9"/> had three Cities, which he called his own; <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he was Bred; <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where he was Born; and <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> where he dwelt; this was a Sea-coaſt Town in the Borders of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nephthali. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Special Providence of God, in this Change of our Saviour's Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for by that means the Prophecy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1. was fulfilled; which declares, that in that dark part of the Country the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the True Light ſhould ſhine forth. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That a People deſtitute of the Saving Knowledge of the Goſpel, are in great Darkneſs, how great ſoever the Light of their Outward Comforts may be. This People had Natural Light enough, and Civil Light enough, they had an Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wealth and Riches, Peace and Plenty, but they wanted the Light of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and therefore are ſaid to ſit in Darkneſs. 2. That where-ever the Goſpel is Preached amongſt a People, it is as a Light ſpringing up and ſhining forth amongſt them; quickning and enlivening, reviving and chearing the Souls of thoſe that entertain it, how great ſoever their outward Darkneſs and Diſtreſs may be. <hi>The People that ſate in Darkneſs ſaw great Light, and to them which ſate in the Region and Shadow of Death, Light is ſprung up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="17">17 From that time Jeſus began to preach, and to ſay, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour begins to enter upon his Prophetick Office, and by Preaching, to make known the Will of God to Mankind; and <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The Doctrine which he Preached is the ſame that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did Preach, namely, the Doctrine of Repentance, <hi>Repent ye;</hi> and the Argument is the ſame alſo, <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> that is, now is the ſo much expected Time of the Appearing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Meſſiah. Learn hence,</hi> That the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Ambaſſadors is alike and the ſame in Subſtance: They both Teach the Doctrine of Repentance to a Loſt World, as moſt ſuitable to the Time and Diſpenſation of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And Jeſus walking by the ſee of Galilee, ſaw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his brother, caſting a net into the ſea, (for they were fiſhers) 19 And he ſaith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men. 20 And they ſtraightway left their nets and followed him. 21 And going on from thence, he ſaw other two brethren, James the ſon of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ſhip with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them. 22 And they immediately left the ſhip, and their father, and followed him.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour, as he was the Great Prophet of his Church, had Power and Authority to Appoint Teachers under him; and accordingly here he begins to call his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to that great Work; and in this Call, we have ſeveral Particulars very <hi>Obſervable:</hi> As, 1. The Meaneſs of the Perſons whom he calls, Illiterate <hi>Fiſhermen;</hi> not a <hi>Paul,</hi> that had long Studied at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> is firſt called, but <hi>Peter,</hi> who was a Stranger to Eloquence and Humane Learning. Hereby our Saviour took effectual Care, that his Goſpel ſhould be known to be <hi>the Power of God,</hi> and not <hi>the Wiſdom</hi> and Device of Man; and that the Inſtrument ſhould not carry away the Glory of the Work. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How our Saviour calls his Apoſtles by Couples, two and two, <hi>Peter and Andrew, James and John;</hi> to let us underſtand, That the Work of the Miniſtry requires the Concurrence of all Hands that are called to it: All the Miniſters of God ſhould put their Hands, join their Hearts, and ſet their Shoulders as one Man, to this Great Work; and all little enough, to carry it on with Advantage and Succeſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Work which they are called to, from being <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> to be <hi>Fiſhers of Men:</hi> They catcht Fiſh before with the Labour of their Hands, they ſhall catch Men now, with the Labour of their Tongues. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Our Saviour's Command, firſt, to follow him, before they are ſent out by him; <hi>Follow me, and I will make you Fiſhers of Men.</hi> We muſt be Chriſt's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, before we are his Miniſters, his Followers, before his Ambaſſadors. We muſt Learn Chriſt, before we Preach him; otherwiſe, we may Fiſh for a Livelihood, for Honour and Applauſe, but not for Souls: If we be not firſt incloſed our ſelves in the Net of the Goſpel, we can have but ſmall Hopes of bringing in of others. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Promiſe, which Chriſt gives his Apoſtles for their Encouragement: 1. To Qualifie them, <hi>I will make you Fiſhers.</hi> 2. To Succeed them, <hi>I will make you Fiſhers of Men.</hi> Faithfulneſs and Care, Diligence and Endeavour i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some Fiſh cleave to the Rocks, others play upon the Sands and more wallow in the Mud; and we ſhall labour all our Days, and catch nothing, if Chriſt doth not bring our Fiſh to Net, and incloſe them in it, as well as aſſiſt us in the throwing of it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. The Apoſtles ready Compliance with our Saviour's Call, <hi>Straightway they followed him.</hi> Whom Chriſt calls, he calls Perſwaſively and Effectually; whom he calls, he draws, and works them to a willing Compliance with their Duty. <hi>Laſtly Obſerve,</hi> Upon their Call to the Miniſtry, they leave off their Trade, they forſake <hi>their Ship</hi> and <hi>their Nets,</hi> and lye cloſe to their Miniſterial Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould wholly give themſelves to their Work, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber themſelves with Secular Affairs; nothing but an indiſpenſible neceſſity in providing for a Family, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a Miniſter's entangling himſelf with Worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>

What ſhall we ſay to thoſe lazy Fiſhermen, who can ſet others to the Drag, and care only to feed themſelves with the Fiſh, not willing to wet their Hands with the Net? Our Bleſſed Saviour, when he ſent forth his Apoſtles, went along with them, and laboured himſelf as much as any of them.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1.

               <argument>
                  <p> This <hi>Chapter</hi> and the two next following, contain Christ's Famous Sermon upon the Mount, which comprehends the Sum and Subſtance both of the Old and New Teſtament. Our Saviour begins this his Sermon with an Exhortation to Duty, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nnexes a Reward to the Performance of that Duty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 AND ſeeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was ſat, his diſciples came unto him. 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Preacher; <hi>He,</hi> that is, Chriſt, the Great Prophet and Teacher of his Church. 2. The Place where he Preached, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon a Mountain;</hi> probably for Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to Himſelf, and Advantage to his Auditors: Tho' ſome will have a Myſtery in it; that as the Law at firſt was given on a Mountain, ſo Chriſt would now explain it upon a Mountain. 3. The Poſture in which he Preached, Sitting; <hi>When he was ſet, he Taught,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, who ſat, to ſhew their Authority. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 4. The Sermon it ſelf, which begins with Beatitudes and Bleſſings, and is accompanied with Promiſes of Reward: Not as the Law was delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Thunder, with Fire and Earthquake, but in a ſtill and ſoft Voice: Our Lord's Lips are full of Grace, they drop as the Honey-comb. Bleſſings and Promiſes are our Encouragements to Obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> the poor in ſpirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. It is not ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Eſtate,</hi> but, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit;</hi> 'tis not a Poverty of Poſſeſſion, but a Poverty of Spirit, that Entitles us to the Bleſſing. 2. 'Tis not ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the Spiritually Poor,</hi> but, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit:</hi> He that is deſtitute of the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt, that has no ſenſe of his Spiritual Wants, he is Spiritually Poor, but he is not <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi> Farther, 3. 'Tis not ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor-Spirited,</hi> but, <hi>the Poor in Spirit;</hi> ſuch as Act below and beneath themſelves as Men, and as Chriſtians, theſe are <hi>Poor-Spirited</hi> Men; but theſe are not <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi> 4. 'Tis not ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that make themſelves Poor,</hi> by leaving their Eſtates and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and turning Beggars, as ſome do among the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> But Bleſſed are they whom the Goſpel makes Poor, by giving them a ſight of their Spiritual Wants and Neceſſities, and directing them to Chriſt, that they may be made Rich. In Sum, not thoſe that are Poor in Eſtate, or thoſe whom the World has made Poor in Poſſeſſion, but thoſe whom the Goſpel has made Poor in Spirit, have a Right and Title to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> they that mourn: for they ſhall be comforted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. That Mourning for Sin is a Goſpel-Duty; the Law allows no place for Repentance, tho' we ſeek it carefully with Tears. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Time and Seaſon for this Duty. Bleſſed are they that <hi>Now</hi> Mourn. Sorrow for Sin is Phyſick on Earth, but 'tis Food in Hell. Repentance is here a Grace, but there a Puniſhment. 3. As Mourning goes before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſo Comfort ſhall follow after Mourning. Our Godly Sorrow for Sin, ſhall end in Everlaſting Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> the meek: for they ſhall inherit the earth.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The Grace and Duty recommended, <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 2. The Wages and Reward belonging to that Grace and Duty, <hi>The Inheritance of the Earth; Meekneſs</hi> either reſpects God, or our Neighbour. As it reſpects God, ſo it implies Flexibleneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o his Commanding Will, and Submiſſiveneſs to his Providential Pleaſure. As it reſpects our Neighbour, it conſiſts in Forgiving Injuries, Bearing Reproaches, and Recompencing Good for Evil. The Reward and Bleſſing Inſured to this Grace and Duty is, the <hi>Inheritance of the Earth</hi> where Heaven is not excluded, but included; yet the Earth is mentioned, to ſhew that Men ſhall be no Loſers by their Meekneſs, as to their Outward Eſtates; for Almighty God will make good to them, whatever they loſe for <hi>Peace</hi>-ſake. Oh Happy Temper of Mind, that at once Secures Heaven and Earth to boot! <hi>Bleſſed are the Meek, for they ſhall inherit the Earth</hi> in this Life, and Heaven in the next.</p>

Wherein their <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> doth conſiſt: <hi>They ſhall be filled.</hi> By <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> we are to underſtand, 1. A <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Juſtification;</hi> the Righteouſneſs of the Mediator imputed to us, by which we ſtand <hi>Righteous</hi> in God's ſight, being freed from Condemnation. 2. A <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> wrought in us by the Holy Spirit, enabling us to Act Righteouſly. By the former, there is a Relative Change in our Condition; by the latter, a Real Change in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. <hi>Learn,</hi> That all, and only ſuch as do Spiritually Hunger and Thirſt after Chriſt and his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> are in an Happy and Bleſſed Condition.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> the merciful: for they ſhall obtain mercy.</p>
               <p>Here our Bleſſed <hi>Redeemer</hi> recommends to us a Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Regard towards the Miſeries of Others, and that both in Soul and Body, Name and Eſtate; to be forward to <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> to <hi>Relieve</hi> and <hi>Help,</hi> to <hi>Give</hi> and <hi>Forgive.</hi> And as an Encouragement he adds, That as we deal with others, God will deal with us; our Charity towards Men, ſhall be Crowned with Mercy from GOD, and that in Abundance too; for our Rivulet of Charity, we ſhall partake of an Ocean of Mercy. <hi>Bleſſed are the Merciful, for they ſhall obtain Mercy. Learn,</hi> That the Merciful Man is a Bleſſed Man, and therefore Bleſſed, becauſe he ſhall obtain Mercy, when he moſt wants it, and moſt deſires it.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee God.</p>

The Duty required and called for, <hi>Purity of Heart and Life;</hi> the firſt expreſſed, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; for a clean Heart will be accompanied with a clean Life: Where there is a <hi>Principle</hi> of Grace within, there will be the <hi>Actings</hi> of Grace without. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The Incentive to this Duty; the <hi>Pure in Heart</hi> and <hi>Holy in Life,</hi> ſhall <hi>See</hi> and <hi>Enjoy GOD;</hi> the infinitely <hi>Pure,</hi> and perfectly <hi>Holy</hi> GOD: They ſhall ſee him <hi>Spiritually</hi> and <hi>Mediately</hi> in this Life, <hi>Gloriouſly,</hi> and <hi>Immediately</hi> in the Life to come.</p>

The Connexion between <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Purity; Purity of Heart</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs of Life</hi> accompany one another; there is no <hi>Inward Purity,</hi> where there is not an Endeavour after <hi>Outward Peace.</hi> 2. The Duty exhorted to, namely, to Love <hi>Peace,</hi> and to Labour after <hi>Peace;</hi> to Love it our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and Promote it amongſt <hi>others;</hi> to be not only <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> but <hi>Peace-makers. Note,</hi> 3. The Title of <hi>Honour</hi> that is here put upon ſuch as are of this <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>Peace-making</hi> Temper; they ſhall be called the <hi>Children of God;</hi> that is, they ſhall be reputed and eſteemed God's Children, for their likeneſs to him who is the <hi>God of Peace.</hi> And they ſhall be dignified and honoured with the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>God's Children;</hi> namely, <hi>Grace</hi> here, and <hi>Glory</hi> herefafter.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Bleſſed <hi>are</hi> ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute <hi>you,</hi> and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the prophets which were before you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. That all the <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Followers</hi> of Chriſt, live they never ſo Holily and Inoffenſively in the World, yet muſt they expect <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Perſecution.</hi> 2. That the keeneſt and ſharpeſt Edge of <hi>Perſecution</hi> is uſually turn'd againſt the Miniſters of Chriſt, and falls heavieſt on the Prophets of God. 3. That ſuch <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> as will Afford a Man Solid <hi>Comfort,</hi> and Entitle
<pb facs="tcp:46556:10"/> him to Real <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> muſt be endured and undergone <hi>for Righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> 4. That it is the Will and Command of Chriſt, that thoſe which <hi>Suffer</hi> for Him and for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-ſake, ſhould not only be Meek and Patient, but Joyous and Chearful: <hi>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad.</hi> 5. That ſuch a patient and chearful <hi>Suffering</hi> of <hi>Perſecution</hi> for Chriſt in this Life, ſhall certainly be Rewarded with the Glory and Bleſſedneſs of the Life that is to come. <hi>Great is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Ye are the ſalt of the earth: but if the ſalt have loſt his ſavour, wherewith ſhall it be ſalted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt out, and to be troden under foot of men.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour compares Chriſtians in general, and his Miniſters in particular, unto <hi>Salt,</hi> for a double Reaſon. Firſt, Becauſe it is the nature of <hi>Salt</hi> to preſerve things from Corruption and Putrefaction, and to render them ſavoury and pleaſant. Thus are the Miniſters of the Goſpel to labour and endeavour by the Purity of their Doctrine, to ſweeten putrefying Sinners, that they may become ſavoury to God and Man; and may be kept from being Fly-blown with Errours and Falſe Doctrine. Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Salt</hi> has a piercing Power in it, which ſubdues the whole Lump, and turns it into its own nature: Such a piercing Power is there in the Miniſtry of the Word, that it ſubdues the whole Man to the Obedience of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is ſet on an hill, cannot be hid. 15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a buſhel: but on a candleſtick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the houſe. 16 Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. Our Saviour's Doctrine. 2. The Inference which he draws from it, by way of <hi>Application.</hi> The Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered is this, That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general, and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in particular, are the <hi>Light of the World.</hi> But how? Not Originally, but Derivatively; not Efficiently, but Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally. Chriſt himſelf is the <hi>Light of the World</hi> by way of Original, his Miniſters are <hi>Lights</hi> by way of Derivation and Participation from him. Farther, Chriſt teaches them the End why he communicated <hi>Light</hi> unto them, namely, to inlighten, direct, and quicken others: Even as the Sun in the Firmament, and a Candle in the Houſe, diffuſes and diſperſes its Light to all that are within the reach of it; ſo ſhould all Chriſtians, and particularly Chriſt's Miniſters, by the Light of Life and Doctrine, direct People in their Way towards Heaven. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Inference which our Saviour draws from the foregoing Doctrine; <hi>Ye are the Light of the World,</hi> therefore, <hi>Let your Light ſhine before Men.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That our <hi>Good Works</hi> muſt ſhine, but not blaze; all Vain-glory and Oſtentation muſt be avoided in the <hi>Good Works</hi> we do. 2. Altho' we muſt abound in <hi>Good Works,</hi> that Men may ſee them, yet not to be ſeen of Men. 3. That the <hi>Glorifying</hi> of God, and doing <hi>Good</hi> to Mankind, muſt be the great End we propound in all the <hi>Good Works</hi> which we perform.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Think not that I am come to deſtroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here informs his <hi>Followers,</hi> That he had no Deſign to Abrogate any part of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> or to Looſe Mankind from the leaſt Meaſure of their <hi>Duty,</hi> either towards <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man;</hi> but that he came <hi>To Fulfil it.</hi> 1. By yielding a <hi>Perſonal Obedience to it.</hi> 2. By giving a fuller and ſtricter <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of it, than the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were wont to give; for they taught that the Law did only reach the outward Man, and reſtrain outward Actions. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the <hi>Law of God</hi> is ſuch a perfect <hi>Rule of Life,</hi> that Chriſt Added no new <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> to it; much leſs intended to Abrogate or Aboliſh any <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Precept</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="18">18 For verily I ſay unto you, Till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law, till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Reaſon</hi> is here given by our Saviour, why he had no intention to Abrogate or Aboliſh the Law; and that is drawn from the <hi>Duration</hi> and <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs</hi> and <hi>Immutability</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> Sooner ſhall Heaven and Earth be aboliſhed, than the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> be diſſolved. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Law of God is an Eternal and Unchangeable Rule of Life and Manners, and is to ſtand in Force as long as the World ſtands, and the Frame of Heaven and Earth endures.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of theſe leaſt commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdom of heaven: but whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>To evidence yet farther, that the Moral Law is a perfect Rule of Life, our Saviour tells his Diſciples, That if any of them did either by their Doctrine or Practice, make void any one of the leaſt of God's Commands, either by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in the Omiſſion of any known Duty, or in the Commiſſion of any known Sin, he ſhould never enter into the Kingdom of God. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as allows himſelf in the leaſt <hi>Voluntary Tranſgreſſion,</hi> either of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and encourages others by his Example to do the like, is certainly in a State of <hi>Damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 For I ſay unto you, That except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A Glorious Prize or Reward ſet before the Chriſtian, as Attainable; namely, <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 2. The Means required, in order to our obtaining of this Prize, and laying hold of this Reward; we muſt be Holy and Righteous Perſons: Heaven is the Reward of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Reward conferred only upon Righteous Perſons. 3. Here is the Special Qualification of that Righteouſneſs expreſſed, which will Intitle us to Heaven and Salvation: It muſt be a Righteouſneſs which <hi>Exceeds the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> and that theſe Three Ways: 1. In its Principle and Motive; Love to God, and Obedience to his Command; not the Applauſe and Commendation of Men. 2. In its Aim and End. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> made Themſelves, their own Credit and Eſteem, their Wordly Gain and Intereſt, their Ultimate End, and not God's Glory, their ſupreme Aim. 3. In the Manner of Performance; the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Duty wanted that Purity and Spirituality which the Law of God required; they had reſpect only to the Outward Action, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the Inward Intention, and to that Purity of Heart which God required. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Heart, and Righteouſneſs of Life, as the Spirituality of God's Law requires of us, is abſolutely and indiſpenſibly neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not kill: and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 22 But I ſay unto you, That whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judgment: and whoſoever ſhall ſay unto his brother, Racha, ſhall be in danger of the council: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, <hi>Thou</hi> fool, ſhall be in danger of hell-fire.</p>
               <p>Here our Bleſſed Saviour begins to Expound the Spiritual Sence and Meaning of the Law, and to Vindicate it from the corrupt Gloſſes of the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Chriſt doth not deliver a New Law, but expounds the Old; and doth not Injoin New Duties, but Inforces the Old Ones. The Law of God was always perfect, requiring the Sons of Men to Love God with all their Hearts, and their Neighbour as themſelves. In this Expoſition of the Law, Chriſt begins with the Sixth Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill:</hi> Where he ſhews, That beſides the actual taking away of Life, a Perſon may violate
<pb facs="tcp:46556:11"/> that Command. 1. By Raſh Anger. 2. By Diſgraceful and Reviling Words. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That every Evil Motion of our Hearts againſt our Neighbour, all unjuſt Anger towards him, all Terms of Contempt put upon him, are forbidden by the Law of God, no leſs than the groſs Act of Murther it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee; 24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 25 Agree with thine adverſary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him: leſt at any time the adverſary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be caſt into priſon. 26 Verily, I ſay unto thee, Thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>For preventing the Sin of raſh Anger, which in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Account is a Degree of Murder, he exhorts all his Diſciples and Followers to Brotherly Agreement, and to ſeek Mutual Reconciliation with each other. <hi>Agree with thine Adverſary:</hi> That is, thy offended, or offending Brother: <hi>Agree with him,</hi> as becomes a Man; <hi>Quickly,</hi> as becomes a Chriſtian: Implying, that it is a neceſſary Duty for every Chriſtian to ſeek Reconciliation ſincerely and ſpeedily, with ſuch as have offended him, or have been offended by him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Argument or Motive with which Chriſt enforces his Exhortation to Brotherly Reconciliation; drawn from the Peril and Danger of the Neglect; and this is Twofold: The Firſt reſpects our preſent Duties and Services, when we wait upon God at his Altar, and attend upon him in Holy Offices. None of our Performances will find Acceptance with God, if there be found Malice and Hatred, Anger and Ill-will againſt our Brother. <hi>Learn,</hi> That no Sacrifice we can offer will be acceptable to God, ſo long as we our ſelves are Implacable to Men. A Second Danger reſpects us, when we appear before God in Judgment; then God will be our Adverſary, Chriſt our Judge, Satan our Accuſer, Hell our Tormentor; <hi>If now from the Heart we do not every one of us forgive our Brother his Treſpaſſes.</hi>

               <p n="27">27 Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, 28 But I ſay unto you, That whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour next proceeds to Explain the Seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which forbids Adultery; by which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> underſtood, only the groſs Act of Uncleanneſs, and Carnal Lying with a Woman. But, ſays our Saviour, Whoever ſecretly in his Heart deſires ſuch a thing, and caſts his Eye upon a Woman in order to ſuch an Act, entertaining only a Thought of it with Pleaſure and Delight, he is an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer in God's Account. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch is the Purity and Spirituality of the Law of God, that it condemns Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Wantonneſs, no leſs than Practical Uncleanneſs; and forbids not only the outward Action, but the ſecret Purpoſe and Intention, and firſt Out-goings of the Soul after unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects.</p>
               <p n="29">29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell. 30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour had condemned Ocular Adultery in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Verſe,</hi> or the Adultery of the Eye; <hi>He that looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her in his Heart.</hi> Whence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Eye is an Inlet to Sin, eſpecially the Sin of Uncleanneſs; Luſt enters the Heart at the Window of the Eye. Now in theſe <hi>Verſes</hi> Chriſt preſcribes a Remedy for the Cure of this Eye-Malady; <hi>If thine Eye offend thee, pluck it out:</hi> Which is not to be underſtood Literally, as if Chriſt commanded any Man to maim his Bodily Members; but Spiritually, to Mortifie the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Luſts of the Eye, which otherwiſe will prove a dangerous Snare to the Soul. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Sin may be avoided; it is our Duty to avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever leads to it, or may be an Occaſion of it; if we find the View of an Inſnaring Object will Inflame us, we muſt, tho' not put out our Eye, yet make a Covenant with our Eye, that we will not look upon it. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That the beſt Courſe we can take to be kept from the Outward Acts of Sin, is to Mortifie our Inward Affection and Love to Sin. This is to Kill it in the Root; and if once our Inward Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be mortified, our Bodily Members may be ſpared and preſerved; for they will no longer be Weapons of Sin, but Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="31">31 It hath been ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. 32 But I ſay unto you, That whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, ſaving for the cauſe of fornication, cauſeth her to commit adultery: and whoſoever ſhall marry her that is divorced, committeth adultery.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour ſtill proceeds in Vindicating and Clearing the Seventh Commandment from the corrupt Gloſſes of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Almighty God had tolerated the <hi>Jews</hi> in Caſe of Uncleanneſs to put away their Wives, by a Bill of Divorce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Hereupon the <hi>Phariſees</hi> maintained it Lawful to put away the Wife upon every ſlight Occaſion. This Abuſe Chriſt corrects, and ſhews, That Divorce, except in Caſe of Adultery, is a certain Breach of the Seventh Commandment. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That ſo Indiſſoluble is the Marriage-Covenant betwixt Two Perſons, that nothing but Adultery, which violates the Bands of Marriage, can diſſolve or diſannul it. 2. When Perſons are juſtly put away, it is unlawful for them to Marry to any other, or for others knowingly to Marry to them.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. 34 But I ſay unto you, Swear nor at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne: 35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footſtool: neither by Jeruſalem, for it is the city of the great king. 36 Neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy head, becauſe thou canſt not make one hair white or black.</p>
               <p>The next Commandment which our Saviour Expounds and Vindicates, is the Third, which requires a Reverent Uſe of God's Name. Now the <hi>Phariſees</hi> taught, that Perjury was the only Breach of this Commandment; and that Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was nothing, if they did not Forſwear themſelves: And that Perſons were only obliged to Swear by the Name of God in Publick Courts of Juſtice; but in their ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcourſe, they might Swear by any of the Creatures. Now in oppoſition to theſe Wicked Principles and Practices, Chriſt ſays, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> That is, 1. Swear not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely in your ordinary Diſcourſe. 2. Swear not Unduly by any of the Creatures; for that is to aſcribe a Deity to them. 3. Swear not Lightly, upon any Trifling or Frivolous Occaſion; for Oaths upon ſmall Occaſions, are great Sins: So that an Oath is not here forbidden by our Saviour, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. <hi>Learn,</hi> That tho' light and needleſs, common and ordinary Swearing be a very great Sin; yet to take an Oath upon a Solemn Occaſion, when Lawfully called thereunto, is a Chriſtian and Neceſſary Duty.</p>
               <p n="37">37 But let your communication be, yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil.</p>
               <p>Here our Lord preſcribes a proper Means and Remedy for ſhunning the Occaſion and Danger of Raſh Swearing; and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:11"/> that is, by uſing and accuſtoming our ſelves in Converſation, to a true Simplicity, and conſtant Plaineſs of Speech; either Affirming or Denying, according to the Nature of the Thing; letting Oaths alone, till we are called to them upon great Occaſions, for ending Strife between Man and Man. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the great End of Speech being to Communicate the Senſe of our Minds each to other, we ought to uſe ſuch Plaineſs and Simplicity in Speaking, that we may believe one another without Oaths, or more Solemn and Religious Aſſeverations.</p>
               <p n="38">38 Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. 39 But I ſay unto you, That ye reſiſt not evil: but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo. 40 And if any man will ſue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo. 41 And whoſoever ſhall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here Vindicates the Sixth Commandment, which obliges us to do no Wrong to the Body of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. God had given a Law to the Publick Magiſtrate, to require an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, when a Perſon was wronged: Hereupon the <hi>Phariſees</hi> taught, That a private Perſon wronged by another, might exact Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from him to the ſame degree, in which he had been Wronged by him; if he had loſt an Eye by another, he might revenge it, by taking away the Eye of another. But, ſays Chriſt, <hi>I ſay unto you, Reſist not Evil;</hi> that is, ſeek not private Revenge, but leave the Avenging of Injuries to God and the Magiſtrate. <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That Chriſtians ought rather to ſuffer a double Wrong, than to ſeek a private Revenge: Chriſtianity obliges us to bear many Injuries patiently, rather than to avenge one privately.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here preſſes the Law of Charity upon his Diſciples: This is Twofold; a Charity in Giving to them that Beg, and a Charity in Lending to them that deſire to Borrow: Chriſtianity obliges all thoſe which have Ability, to abound in Works of Charity of all ſorts and kinds whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. He that is truly Charitable, doth not only Give, but Lend; yea, ſometimes Lends, looking for nothing again: It is not enough to act Charity of one ſort, but we muſt be ready to act it in every kind, and to the higheſt Degree that our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Abilities will admit.</p>
               <p n="43">43 Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: 44 But I ſay unto you, Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you:</p>
               <p>Another corrupt Gloſs which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had put upon the Law of God, our Saviour here takes notice of: The Law ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour,</hi> Levit. 19.18. this they interpreted, to relate only to their own Country-men the <hi>Jews;</hi> concluding, that they might hate all the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Nations, as Enemies: But, ſaith our Saviour, I require you to love all Men; for if Enemies muſt not be ſhut out of our Love, none muſt. <hi>Love your Enemies;</hi> here the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affection is required. <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you;</hi> there outward Civility and Affability is required. <hi>Do good to them that hate you;</hi> here real Acts of Kindneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are commanded to be done by us to our bittereſt and moſt malicious Enemies. <hi>Pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you:</hi> Theſe are the higheſt Expreſſions of Enmity that can be, Calumny and Cruelty; yet are we commanded to Pray for thoſe that touch us in theſe two tendereſt Points, our Reputation, and our Life. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſtianity obliges us to bear a ſincere Affection towards our moſt malicious Enemies; to be ready upon all Occaſions, to do Good unto them, and to Pray for them.</p>
               <p n="45">45 That ye may be the children of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven. for he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</p>
               <p>To encourage us to the foregoing Duty of Loving our Enemies, our Saviour propounds the Example of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our Imitation, <hi>That you may be the Children of your Father;</hi> that is, that you may be known to be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, by your likeneſs to him, and imitation of him. <hi>Note,</hi> That the beſt Evidence we can have of our Divine Sonſhip, is our Conformity to the Divine Nature, eſpecially in thoſe Excellent Properties of Goodneſs and Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p n="46">46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the ſame? 47 And if ye ſalute your brethren only, what do you more <hi>than others?</hi> do not even the publicans ſo?</p>
               <p>Yet farther to encourage us to this Duty of Loving our Enemies, Chriſt aſſures his Diſciples, that he expects more from them, than from others; more than common Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and civil Courteſie towards Friends; for even Heathens by the Light of Nature were taught to love thoſe that love them: But he expected that Chriſtianity ſhould teach them better, and lead them farther, even, <hi>To love their Enemies, and to bleſs them that curſe them. Note,</hi> Love for Love is Juſtice; Love for no Love is Favour and Kindneſs; but Love for Hatred and Enmity, is Divine Goodneſs; a Chriſt-like Temper, which will render us Illuſtrious on Earth, and Glorious in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="48">48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven is perfect.</p>
               <p>That is, Aim at Perfection in all Chriſtian Virtues and Divine Graces, but particularly, in this of Love; in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Heavenly Father, who is the perfect Pattern of all deſirable Goodneſs, and adorable Perfections. <hi>To be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as our heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> is indeed impoſſible, as to Equality, but not as to Imitation. The Word rendred here <hi>Perfect,</hi> by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is elſewhere by St. <hi>Luke</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Merciful,</hi> Luk. 6.36. Implying, That Charity is the Perfection of a Chriſtian's Graces: He that is made perfect in Love, is perfect in all Divine Graces, in the Account of God. <hi>Learn,</hi> That no leſs than perfect and compleat Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Grace, and particularly in the Grace of Love and Charity, is, and ought to be the Aim of every Chriſtian in this Life, and ſhall be his Attainment in the next.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p> This Chapter is a Continuation of our Saviour's Incomparable Sermon upon the Mount, in which he cautions his Diſciples against the Hypocriſie and Vain-glory of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> both in their Almſgiving and Prayers: The former in the first Four Verſes of this Chapter, which ſpeak thus:</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 TAKE heed that you do not your alms before men, to be ſeen of them: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 2 Therefore, when thou doeſt thine alms, do not ſound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the ſynagogues, and in the ſtreets, that they may have glory of men. Verily, I ſay unto you, they have their reward. 3 But when thou doeſt alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth: 4 That thine alms may be in ſecret: and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, himſelf ſhall reward thee openly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Duty directed to, Almſgiving after a right manner; <hi>Do not your Alms before Men;</hi> ſome Copies read it, <hi>Do not your Righteouſneſs before Men:</hi> Becauſe Almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is a conſiderable part of that Righteouſneſs and Juſtice, which we owe unto our Neighbour; he that is Uncharitable, is Unjuſt: Acts of Charity, are Acts of Juſtice and Equity. It alſo intimates to us, That the Matter of our Alms ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:46556:12"/> be Goods righteouſly gotten; to give Alms of what is gotten unjuſtly, is Robbery, and not Righteouſneſs. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. Our Saviour's cautionary Direction in giving of Alms, <hi>Take heed that you do them not to be ſeen of Men.</hi> It is one thing to do our Alms that Men may ſee them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing to do them that they may be ſeen of Men. We ought to do Alms before Men, that GOD may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but <hi>Not to be ſeen of Men,</hi> that our Selves may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The particular Sin, which our Saviour warns his Diſciples againſt in giving their Alms, namely, Oſtentation and Vain-glory, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly guilty of; <hi>Sounding a Trumpet,</hi> to call People about them when they gave their Alms. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That the doing any Good Work, eſpecially any Work of Charity and Mercy vain-gloriouſly, not with an Eye at God's Glory, will certainly miſs of the Reward of Well-doing in another World. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Advice given by our Saviour for the Prevention of this Sin and Danger; and that is, to do our Alms as ſecretly as we can; <hi>Let not thy left Hand know what thy right Hand doth:</hi> That is, conceal it from thy neareſt Relations, and if poſſible, from thy Self. <hi>Note thence,</hi> That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of our Charity is one good Evidence of its Sincerity. Hence the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made the Emblem of Charity to be a Blind Boy, reaching out Honey to a Bee that had loſt her Wings.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And when thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray ſtanding in the ſynagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeen of men. Verily, I ſay unto you, they have their reward. 6 But thou, when thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour warns his Diſciples againſt the ſame Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Hypocriſie in Praying, which he had before reproved in Almſgiving. It was Lawful to Pray in the Synagogues, and to Pray ſtanding, and that before Men; but to do this upon deſign to be Applauded by Men, is condemned by Chriſt. Our Buſineſs in Prayer lyes with God, we are not to concern our ſelves, how Men like our Performances; it is ſufficient, if God doth approve, and will accept them. To cure the foregoing Vanity, Chriſt directs to Secret Prayer in our Cloſets, where God is the Witneſs, and will be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of our Sincerity. <hi>Note,</hi> That Secret Prayer is a commanded and encouraged Duty, and when in Sincerity performed, ſhall be attended with a publick and glorious Reward: <hi>Pray to thy Father which is in ſecret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But when ye pray, uſe not vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the heathen do: for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking. 8 Be ye not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
               <p>A vain-glorious Oſtentation in Prayer was condemned by our Saviour in the former <hi>Verſe;</hi> here a vain-glorious Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Words, by idle Tautologies, and impertinent Repetitions, is condemned alſo: After the manner of the Heathen, who expect to have their Prayers granted by God for the Multiplicity of Words uſed by themſelves. <hi>Hence Note,</hi> That a Chriſtian's Buſineſs in Prayer being not to inform God; <hi>(For he knoweth what things we need, before we ask him;)</hi> nor yet to move and perſwade God, (for he is <hi>Our Father;</hi>) it certainly argues an undue Aprehenſion of God, when we lengthen out our Prayers with vain Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and a multitude of Words.</p>
               <p n="9">9 After this manner therefore pray ye:</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, for preventing theſe and all other Faults in Prayer, I will my ſelf give you a Compleat Form of Prayer, to be uſed when you Pray with others, and an exact Pattern and Platform for your Imitation when you Pray alone by your ſelves. <hi>Note,</hi> That the Lord's Prayer is both a Perfect Form of Prayer which ought to be uſed by us, and alſo a Pattern and Platform, according to which all our Prayers ought to be framed. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>After this manner Pray ye;</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, <hi>When ye Pray, ſay,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. 10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread. 12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p>
               <p>The Sence and Signification of this beſt of Prayers, is this: <hi>Oh thou our Father in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt! <hi>who remainest in thy Throne in Heaven, and art there perpetually Praiſed, and perfectly Obeyed by Glorious Angels and Glorified Saints; Grant that Thy Name may be Glorified, Thy Throne Acknowledged, and Thy Holy Will Obeyed here on Earth below, by us thy Sons and Servants, most ſincerely and readily, and in ſome proportion to what is done in Heaven. And becauſe by reaſon of the Frailty of our Natures, we cannot ſubſist without the Comforts and Supports of Life, We crave, That ſuch a Proportion of the Good Things of this Life may be given in unto us, as may be ſufficient for us; and that we may be content with our Allowance. And knowing that thy Holineſs and Juſtice obliges thee to puniſh Sin and Sinners, we Plead with thee, for the ſake of thy Son's Satisfaction, to Pardon to us our daily Treſpaſſes which we are guilty of in this State of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; as we do freely and heartily Forgive others that have offended and wronged us. And ſeeing that by reaſon of the Frailty of our Natures, we are prone to ruſh upon, and run into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we crave, That by the Power of thy Omnipotent Grace we may be kept from Satan's Temptations, from the World's Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from our own Evil Inclinations, and be preſerved unblamable to thine Everlaſting Kingdom; which is exalted over all Perſons, over all Places, over all Things, in all Times, past, preſent, and to come: And accordingly, in Teſtimony of our Deſires, and in Aſſurance to be Heard and Anſwered, we ſay Amen. So be it, So let it be, Even ſo, O Lord, let it be for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 For, if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly father will alſo forgive you. 15 But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.</p>
               <p>There being no Duty to which our corrupt Natures are more backward, than this of Forgiving Injuries, our Saviour repeats that Duty over and over, and frequently inculcates it in the Holy Goſpels: Aſſuring us, That Forgiving others, is the indiſpenſible Condition upon which we are to expect Forgiveneſs from God. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That every time we go to God in Prayer, and beg Forgiveneſs of him, as we Forgive others, if we do not Forgive them heartily and ſincerely, fully and freely, readily and willingly, we Lie in the Face of GOD, and our Prayers are a ſort of Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt our Selves.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Moreover, when ye faſt, be not as the hypocrites, of a ſad countenance: for they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure their faces, that they may appear unto men to faſt. Verily, I ſay unto you, they have their reward. 17 But thou, when thou faſteſt, anoint thine head, and waſh thy face: 18 That thou appear not unto men to faſt, but unto thy Father which is in ſecret: and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</p>
               <p>The next Duty which our <hi>Saviour</hi> inſtructs his Diſciples in, is that of <hi>Religious Faſting,</hi> which is a <hi>Devoting</hi> of the whole Man, <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> to a Solemn and Extraordinary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon GOD, in a particular Time, ſet apart for that purpoſe; in order to the Deprecating of his Diſpleaſure, and for the Supplicating of his Favour; accompanied with an Abſtinence from <hi>Bodily Food,</hi> and <hi>Senſual Delights,</hi> and from all <hi>Secular Affairs,</hi> and <hi>Worldly Buſineſs.</hi> Now our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Direction as to this Duty of <hi>Faſting</hi> is double: 1. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions us to beware of an Abuſe in <hi>Faſting: Be not as the Hypocrites are, of a ſad Countenance;</hi> that is, Do not affect a ſullen Sadneſs, Ghaſtlineſs and Unpleaſantneſs of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, like the Hypocritical <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who vitiate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour their Faces, do marr and aboliſh their Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.

The <hi>Reaſon</hi> aſſigned, why we ſhould lay up our Treaſure in Heaven, is this: Becauſe Heavenly Treaſures are ſubject to no ſuch Accidents and Caſualties, as Earthly Treaſures are, but are durable and laſting. <hi>The things that are not ſeen, are eternal:</hi> The Treaſures of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are inviolable, incorruptible, and everlaſting.

               <p>In the foregoing <hi>Verſes,</hi> our Saviour acquainted us what in our <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> we ſhould eſteem as our <hi>Chief Treaſure:</hi> Now this Judgment concerning our Chief Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is by our <hi>Saviour</hi> here compared to the Eye; as the Eye is the Candle of the Body, that inlightens and directs it, ſo our Underſtanding and Judgment of the Excellency of Heaven, and the Things Above, will draw our Affections towards them, and quicken our Endeavours after them. <hi>Note thence,</hi> That ſuch as our <hi>Judgment</hi> is concerning <hi>Happineſs,</hi> ſuch will our <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Endeavours</hi> be, for the Attainment of that <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Our <hi>Affections</hi> are guided by our <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions;</hi> where the <hi>Eſteem</hi> is high, <hi>Endeavours</hi> will be ſtrong.</p>

               <p n="25">25 Therefore I ſay unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye ſhall put on: is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? 26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>
               <p>The next Sin which our Saviour cautions his Diſciples againſt, is immoderate Care for the things of this Life; ſuch a ſolicitous and vexatious Care for <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment,</hi> as is accompanied with Diffidence and Diſtruſt of GOD's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Providence over us, and Proviſion for us; and the Arguments which our Saviour uſes to diſſwade from this Sin, are many and cogent, laid down in the following <hi>Verſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit to his ſtature? 28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Conſider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they ſpin. 29 And yet I ſay unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like one of theſe. 30 Wherefore if God ſo cloath the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven, ſhall he not much more cloath you, O ye of little faith? 31 Therefore take no thought, ſaying, What ſhall we eat? or what ſhall we drink? or wherewithal ſhall we be cloathed? 32 (For after all theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek) For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things.</p>
               <p>Four Arguments are here uſed by our Saviour, to diſſwade us from the Sin of Anxious Care; 'tis needleſs, 'tis fruitleſs, 'tis heatheniſh, 'tis bruitiſh. 1. 'Tis needleſs; <hi>Your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of theſe things,</hi> and will certainly provide for you; and what need you take Care, and God too? 2. 'Tis fruitleſs; <hi>Which of you by taking thought, can add one Cubit to his Stature?</hi> That is, by all our Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous Care we can add nothing, either to the Length or Comfort of our Lives. 3. 'Tis heatheniſh; <hi>After all theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek.</hi> 4. 'Tis brutiſh, nay, worſe than brutiſh; <hi>The Fowls of the Air,</hi> and the Beaſts of the Field are fed by God, much more ſhall his Children: Has God a Breakfaſt for every little Bird that comes chirping out of its Neſt? And for every Beaſt in the Wilderneſs that comes leaping out of its Den? And will he not much more provide for you, Oh ye of little Faith? Surely he that feeds the Ravens when they Cry, will not ſtarve his Children when they Pray.</p>
               <p n="33">33 But ſeek ye firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:13"/>
               <p>That is, Let your firſt and chief Care be to promote the Kingdom of Grace in this World, and to ſecure the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory in the next; and in order unto both, ſeek after an Univerſal Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, both of Heart and Life; and then fear not the want of theſe Outward Comforts, they ſhall be added in Meaſure, tho' not in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; to Satisfie, tho' not to Satiate; for Health, tho' not for Surfeit. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That Chriſtians muſt here on Earth ſet themſelves to ſeek Heaven, or the Kingdom of God. 2. That God's Kingdom cannot be ſought, without God's Righteouſneſs: <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the only way to <hi>Happineſs.</hi> 3. That Heaven, or the Kingdom of God, muſt be ſought in the firſt place, with our chief Care, and principal Endeavour. 4. That Heaven being once ſecured by us, all Earthly Things ſhall be ſuperadded by God, as he ſees needful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for us.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelf: ſufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour reinforces his Dehortation from Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Care for Worldly Things, aſſuring us, That every Day will bring with it a ſufficient Burden of Trouble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought not to torment our ſelves, by antedating our own Sorrows, and foretelling what may, or may not come to paſs. <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is a Painful, Sinful, and Unprofitable Evil, to perplex our ſelves with diſtruſtful and diſtracting Fears of what may come upon us: Every Day has its own Duty and Difficulty; and tho' Sufferings muſt be expected, and prepared for, yet we muſt not torment our ſelves to Day, with the Fears of what may be to Morrow; but every Day <hi>cast our Burden</hi> of Care <hi>upon that God, who daily careth for us.</hi>

                  <p> Our Bleſſed Saviour having continued his Sermon on the Mount in the former Chapter, concludes it in this, with an Exhortation to ſeveral Duties; the First of which is, To forbear Raſh Judging of others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 JUDGE not, that ye be not judged. 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged: and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Prohibition, and the Reaſon of that Prohibition. The Prohibition, <hi>Judge not:</hi> This is not meant of our Selves, but of our Neighbour. Self-judging is a great Duty, Judging others a grievous Sin: Yet is not all Judging of others condemned, but a Judging of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's State or Perſon, raſhly and rigidly, cenſoriouſly and uncharitably; eſpecially unrighteouſly and unjuſtly? And the Reaſon of the Prohibition is added, <hi>If we Judge others</hi> Raſhly, <hi>God will Judge us</hi> Righteouſly. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That a Raſh and Cenſorious Judging of Others, renders a Perſon liable and obnoxious to the Righteous Judgment of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but conſidereſt not the beam that is in thine own eye? 4 Or how wilt thou ſay to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 5 Thou hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye; and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's eye.</p>

That thoſe who are moſt <hi>Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> of the leſſer Infirmities of Others, are uſually moſt <hi>notoriouſly Guilty</hi> of far greater Failings Themſelves. 2.

How Chriſt provides, as for the Honour of his <hi>Word,</hi> ſo for the Safety of thoſe that Publiſh it. As Chriſt will not have his <hi>Word</hi> offered to ſome Sinners, leſt they ſhould abuſe it; ſo leſt they ſhould abuſe thoſe that bring it.

               <p n="7">7 Ask, and it ſhall be given you: ſeek, and ye ſhall find: knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. 8 For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that ſeeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened. 9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his ſon ask bread, will he give him a ſtone? 10 Or if he ask a fiſh, will he give him a ſerpent? 11 If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</p>

That Natural Propenſity, which we find in our Breaſts, to hear the <hi>Deſires,</hi> and to ſupply the <hi>Wants</hi> of our own <hi>Children,</hi> ought to raiſe in us a confident <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> That Almighty God will <hi>hear</hi> our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>ſupply</hi> our <hi>Wants,</hi> when we Call upon him: If a Father will give when a Child asks, much more will God. <hi>If ye being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this Rule, <hi>It is the Law and the Prophets;</hi> that is, the Sum of the Old Teſtament; ſo far as concerns our Duty to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and the Subſtance of the Second Table. <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is the Deſign of the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> firſt, to render Men <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and then <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> one to another. <hi>This is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> yea, the whole of the Law and the Prophets, to <hi>Love</hi> GOD above our ſelves, and to <hi>Love</hi> our Neighbour as our ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A <hi>Caution</hi> given, <hi>Beware of Falſe Prophets.</hi> There were two ſorts of Deceivers, which our Saviour gave his Diſciples a ſpecial Warning of; namely, Falſe <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and Falſe <hi>Prophets:</hi> Falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> were ſuch as pretended to be the True <hi>Meſſias;</hi> Falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſuch who pretended to own <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but drew People away from the Simplicity of the <hi>Goſpel.

               <argument>
                  <p> This Chapter is called by St. <hi>Ambroſe, Scriptura Miraculoſa,</hi> the Miraculous Scripture; there being ſeveral great Miracles recorded in this Chapter: As the Cleanſing of the Leper, the Curing of the Centurion's Servant, the Appeaſing of the Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour having delivered his Doctrine in the former Chapters; in this he backs his Doctrine with Miracles, for the Eſtabliſhment and Confirmation of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 WHEN he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. 2 And behold, there came a leper, and worſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean. 3 And Jeſus put forth his hand, and touched him, ſaying, I will,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:14"/> be thou clean. And immediately his leproſie was cleanſed. 4 And Jeſus ſaith unto him, See thou tell no man, but go thy way, ſhew thy ſelf to the prieſt, and offer the gift that Moſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, for a teſtimony unto them.</p>
               <p>Several <hi>Particulars</hi> are here <hi>Obſervable;</hi> as, 1. The <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner,</hi> and that is a <hi>Leper,</hi> he <hi>came</hi> and <hi>Worſhipped</hi> Chriſt, and petitions him to Heal him, ſaying, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</hi> Where he diſcovers a firm Belief of Chriſt's <hi>Power,</hi> but a Diffidence and Diſtruſt of Chriſt's <hi>Will,</hi> to Heal him. <hi>Learn,</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Divine Power</hi> muſt be fully aſſented to, and firmly believed, by all thoſe that expect Benefit by him, and Healing from him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How readily our Saviour grants his <hi>Petition;</hi> Jeſus <hi>touched him, ſaying, I will, be thou clean.</hi> Our Saviour by <hi>touching</hi> the Leper, ſhew'd himſelf to be above the Law, as GOD; tho' ſubject to the Law, as Man; for by the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> the Leper was forbidden to be Toucht. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> That Chriſt's curing the Leper by the Word of his Mouth, and the Touch of his Hand, ſhewed his <hi>Divine Power,</hi> and proved himſelf to be truly and really GOD. <hi>Leproſie</hi> being called by the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Finger</hi> of God, a Diſeaſe of his ſending, and of his removing; our Saviour therefore as a Proof of his being the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> tells the Diſciples of <hi>John, That the Lepers were cleanſed,</hi> Matth. 11.5. <hi>and the Dead raiſed:</hi> Which being put together, intimates, That the <hi>Cleanſing</hi> of the Leper is as peculiar an Act of <hi>Divine Power,</hi> as the <hi>Raiſing</hi> of the Dead; and accordingly, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.7. ſaid the King, <hi>Am I a God, that this Man ſends to me, to cure a Man of his Leproſie? Obſ.</hi> 3. The <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Suddeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Cure; Immediately his Leproſie was cleanſed:</hi> Chriſt not only cured him without <hi>Means,</hi> but without the ordinary <hi>Time</hi> required for ſuch a Cure. Thus Chriſt ſhewed both Power and Will to Cure him Miraculouſly, who believed his Power, but queſtioned his Willingneſs. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Charge and Command given by Chriſt after the Cure: 1. <hi>To tell it to no Man;</hi> wherein the Modeſty, Humility, and Piety of Chriſt is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, together with the Care of his own Safety. His Modeſty, in not deſiring his Good Deeds ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; his Humility, in ſhunning vain-glorious Applauſe and Commendation; his Piety, in deſiring all the Praiſe, Honour and Glory ſhould redound intirely to God; and his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re of his own Safety, leſt the Publiſhing of this Miracle ſhould create him untimely Danger from the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> The Second Part of the Charge which Chriſt gave the recovered Leper, was, <hi>To ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt, and offer the Gift which</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded for a Teſtimony unto them:</hi> That is, as a Teſtimony to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that he did not oppoſe the Ceremonial Law given by <hi>Moſes. Where Note,</hi> That our Saviour would have the Ceremonial Law punctually Obſerved, ſo long as the Time for its Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance did endure; tho' he came to deſtroy that Law, yet whilſt it ſtood, he would have it obſerved.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And when Jeſus was entred into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beſeeching him, 6 And ſaying, Lord, my ſervant lieth at home ſick of the palſie, grievouſly tormented. 7 And Jeſus ſaith unto him, I will come and heal him. 8 The centurion anſwered and ſaid, Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof: but ſpeak the word only, and my ſervant ſhall be healed. 9 For I am a man under authority, having ſoldiers under me: and I ſay to this man, Go, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and he cometh: and to my ſervant, Do this, and he doth it. 10 When Jeſus heard it, he marvelled, and ſaid to them that followed, Verily I ſay unto you, I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael.</p>
               <p>The Second Miracle our Saviour works in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> is the Healing of the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Servant: Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Perſon that applies to our Saviour for Help and Healing; he was a Gentile, an Heathen, a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier, an Officer and Commander; yet he believes in, and relies upon the Power of Chriſt. <hi>Note,</hi> That ſuch is the Freeneſs of Divine Grace, that it extends it ſelf to all Sorts and Ranks, to all Orders and Degrees of Men, without Exception. Even the Bloody Trade of War yields worthy Clients to Chriſt. He doth not ſo much regard who we are, and whence we are; as what we are, and with what Diſpoſitions and Inclinations we come unto him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Perſon whom the <hi>Centurion</hi> comes to Chriſt for; not for Himſelf, nor for his Son, but for his Servant; his Servant is ſick, he doth not drive him out of Doors, nor ſtand gazing by his Bed-ſide, but looks out for Help and Relief for him; a Worthy Example. Some Maſters have not ſo much Regard to their ſick Servants, as they have for their Oxen or their Swine; but he is not worthy of a good Servant, that in a time of Sickneſs is not willing to ſerve his Servant. A conceit of Superiority, muſt beget in no Man a Neglect of Charitable Offices towards Inferiors. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Unto whom the <hi>Centurion</hi> ſeeks, and with what Zeal and Application; he ſeeks not to <hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>Conjurers,</hi> but to the <hi>Phyſician</hi> for his poor Servant; yea, to Chriſt, the beſt <hi>Phyſician;</hi> and this not with a formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in his Mouth, but with a vehement Aggravation of the Diſeaſe; <hi>My Servant is grievouſly tormented:</hi> Where the <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Condolency and tender Sympathy with his afflicted Servant, is both matter of Commendation, and Imitation alſo. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The happy Mixture of Humility and Faith which was found in this <hi>Centurion;</hi> he owns his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs</hi> of having Chriſt come under his Roof; yet acknowledges Chriſt's Power, that by the ſpeaking of a Word his Servant might be Healed by him. Humility is both the Fruit of Faith, and the Companion of Faith; an humble Soul has an high Eſteem of Chriſt, and a low Eſteem of himſelf. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. How our Bleſſed Saviour exceeds both his <hi>Deſires</hi> and his <hi>Expectations;</hi> Chriſt ſays not only, I will Heal him, but, I will Come and Heal him: Wonderful Condeſcenſion! In St. <hi>John,</hi> ch. 4. ver. 47. we read of a certain Noble-man and Ruler, that twice intreated our Saviour to come to his Houſe and Heal his Son; but our Lord refuſed, and did not ſtir a Foot: Here the <hi>Centurion</hi> doth but barely tell Chriſt of his poor Servant's <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> and Chriſt both unask'd and undeſired ſays, <hi>I will come and Heal him.</hi> Oh how far was Chriſt from ſeeming in the leaſt to honour Riches, and deſpiſe Poverty! He that came in the Form of a Servant, goes down and viſits a ſick Servant upon his poor Pallat-Bed, that would not viſit the rich Couch of the Ruler's Son. How ſhould we ſtoop to the loweſt Offices of Love and Kindneſs to one another, when Chriſt thus condeſcendingly abaſed Himſelf before us? <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. The Notice and Obſervation which our Saviour takes of the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Faith; <hi>He</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at it from him, who had wrought it in him: Chriſt wrought this Faith as God, and wondred at it as Man: What can be more Wonderful, than to ſee CHRIST. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! We do not find our Saviour wondring at Worldly Pomp and Greatneſs. When the <hi>Diſciples</hi> wondred at the Magnificence of the <hi>Temple,</hi> Chriſt rather rebuked them, than wondred with them. But when he ſees the gracious Acts of Faith, he is raviſhed with Wonder. Let it teach us to place our Admiration where Chriſt fixes his: Let us be more affected with the leaſt Meaſures of Grace in a Good Man, than with all the Gaieties and Glory of a Great Man: Let us not Envy the one, but Admire the other.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And I ſay unto you, that many ſhall come from the eaſt and weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: 12 But the children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. 13 And Jeſus ſaid unto the centurion, Go thy way, and as thou haſt believed, ſo be it done unto thee. And his ſervant was healed in the ſelf ſame hour.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt Occaſion that Chriſt took to ſpeak of the <hi>Calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Rejection</hi> of the <hi>Jews. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here,</hi> That the Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> are called <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom,</hi> becauſe Born within the Pale of the <hi>Viſible Church;</hi> they preſumed that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> was Entailed upon them, becauſe they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; they boaſted of, and gloried in their External and Outward <hi>Priviledges. Note thence,</hi> 1. That <hi>Goſpel-Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Church-Priviledges</hi> enjoyed, are a ſpecial <hi>Honour</hi> to a People admitted to the Participation of them: Our Saviour here
<pb facs="tcp:46556:14"/> ſtiles the <hi>Jews</hi> upon that Account, <hi>The Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> 2. That ſuch <hi>Priviledges</hi> injoyed, but not improved, do provoke Almighty God to inflict the heavieſt of <hi>Judgments</hi> upon a People. <hi>The Children of the Kingdom ſhall be cast out into utter Darkneſs;</hi> that is, into the <hi>Darkneſs of Hell,</hi> where ſhall be perpetual <hi>Lamentations</hi> for the Remembrance of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> kindly offered, but unthankfully rejected.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And when Jeſus was come into Peter's houſe, he ſaw his wive's mother laid, and ſick of a fever. 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and ſhe roſe and miniſtred unto them.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Miracle</hi> which our Saviour wrought, was in Curing <hi>Peter</hi>'s Wive's Mother of a Fever; the Miracle was not in Curing an Incurable Diſtemper, but in the Way and Manner of Curing: For, 1. It was by a <hi>Touch</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Hand.</hi> 2. It was <hi>Inſtantaneous,</hi> and <hi>Sudden; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Fever left her.</hi> 3. The <hi>viſible Effects</hi> of her <hi>Recovery</hi> preſently appeared, <hi>She inſtantly aroſe, and miniſtred unto them.</hi> That ſhe could Ariſe, argued her Cure <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;</hi> that ſhe could and did Ariſe, and Adminiſter unto Chriſt, argued her <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> and a great <hi>Senſe</hi> of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> upon her Mind. <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. That <hi>Marriage</hi> in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, yea, even in the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in <hi>Peter,</hi> the chiefeſt of them, was neither cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, nor condemned by our Saviour. St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Wife and Family, which Chriſt condeſcends to Viſit. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. That the firſt thing which Chriſt takes notice of in the Houſe, which he condeſcends to Viſit, is, what Aileth any in it; what Need they ſtand of his Help and Healing; and accordingly, together with his <hi>Preſence,</hi> he affords them <hi>Relief. Learn,</hi> 3. That when Chriſt has graciouſly Viſited and Healed any of his Servants, it ought to be their firſt Work, and next Care, to Adminiſter unto Chriſt; that is, to employ their Recovered Health, and improve their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Strength in his Service.</p>
               <p n="16">16 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were poſſeſſed with devils: and he caſt out the ſpirits with his word, and healed all that were ſick: 17 That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Eſaias the prophet, ſaying, Himſelf took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes.</p>
               <p>It was very common about the Time of our SAVIOUR's Coming in the Fleſh, for the Devil bodily to <hi>Poſſeſs</hi> Perſons, and very grievouſly to <hi>Torment</hi> them. This is one of the ſad and diſmal <hi>Evils</hi> which Sin has made us liable and obnoxious to, to be Bodily <hi>Poſſest</hi> by Satan; when we give Satan the Power of our <hi>Hearts,</hi> it is a juſt and righteous thing with God, to give him the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of our <hi>Bodies.</hi> But who is the <hi>Perſon</hi> that <hi>Diſpoſſeſſes</hi> Satan? Chriſt Jeſus: 'Tis a ſtronger than the Strong Man, that muſt caſt out Satan: Our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in whom we truſt, by his <hi>Powerful Word</hi> alone can deliver from Satan's Power, and all the ſad <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> thereof. <hi>But Obſerve,</hi> With what <hi>Condolency</hi> and <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing Pity,</hi> he exerciſes theſe Acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> towards poor Creatures, he is ſaid to take our <hi>Infirmities</hi> upon Himſelf, and to bear our <hi>Sickneſſes;</hi> he bare the Guilt, which was the Cauſe of theſe <hi>Griefs</hi> and <hi>Sorrows;</hi> and he bare the Sorrows themſelves, by a tender <hi>Sympathy</hi> with us under the Burthen of them. Chriſt conſiders our <hi>Sufferings</hi> as his own: <hi>He is afflicted in all our Afflictions,</hi> and pained with all our Pains; in this Sence, <hi>He took our Infirmities, and bare our Sickneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 Now when Jeſus ſaw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other ſide. 19 And a certain ſcribe came, and ſaid unto him, Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt. 20 And Jeſus ſaith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> A Perſon reſolving to follow Chriſt; a Good Reſolution, if made deliberately, and not raſhly, for Siniſter Ends and Secular Advantages; which, it is to be feared, was the Caſe here, by the Anſwer which our Saviour gives; for, ſays he, <hi>Foxes have Holes,</hi> &amp;c. that is, my Condition in this World is very poor, worſe than the Birds of the Air; for they have their fixed Neſts; or the Beaſts of the Earth, for they have their Dens and Holes; but I have no fixed Habitation. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That many Perſons take up raſh and ſudden Reſolutions to follow Chriſt, before they have well conſidered what it will coſt them; what they are like to gain or loſe, by being his Diſciples. 2. That ſuch Men may find themſelves miſerably miſtaken, who expect to gain any thing by following of Chriſt, but their Souls Salvation.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And another of his diſciples ſaid unto him, Lord, ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my father. 22 But Jeſus ſaid unto him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.</p>

                  </gap>ſe by this Prohibition, that Chriſt diſallows or diſapproves of any Civil Office from one Perſon to another, much leſs of a Child to a Parent, either living or dying: But he lets us know, 1. That no Office of Love and Service to Man, muſt be preferred before our Duty to God, unto whom we owe our firſt Obedience. 2. That Lawful and Decent Offices become Sinful, when they hinder greater Duties. 3. That ſuch as are called to the Work and Imployment of the Miniſtry, muſt mind that alone, and leave Inferior Duties to Inferior Perſons: As if our Saviour had ſaid, Others will ſerve well enough to Bury the Dead; but thou that art a Conſecrated Perſon, muſt do that unto which thou art conſecrated and ſet apart. Under the Law, the Prieſts might not come near a dead Corps, nor meddle with the Interrment of their own Parents; unto which our Saviour probably alludes.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And when he was entred into a ſhip, his diſciples followed him. 24 And behold, there aroſe a great tempeſt in the ſea, inſomuch that the ſhip was covered with the waves: but he was aſleep. 25 And his diſciples came to him, and awoke him, ſaying, Lord ſave us: we periſh. 26 And he ſaith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he aroſe and rebuked the winds and the ſea, and there was a great calm. 27 But the men mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, ſaying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the ſea obey him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Chriſt and his Diſciples no ſooner put forth to Sea, but Dangers attend, and Difficulties do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them; a Tempeſt aroſe, and the Ship was covered with Waves. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the Preſence of Chriſt it ſelf, doth not exempt his Diſciples and Followers from Trouble and Danger; here is a great Tempeſt about the <hi>Diſciples</hi> Ears, tho' <hi>Christ</hi> was in their Company. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Poſture our Saviour was in when this Tempeſt aroſe; he being weary on the Land, was fallen aſleep in the Ship: Our Bleſſed Redeemer hereby ſhewed himſelf to be truly and really Man; as he took upon him our Human Nature, ſo he ſubjected himſelf to our Human Infirmities. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The <hi>Diſciples</hi> Application made to him; they awoke him with a ſad Out-Cry, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh;</hi> here was Faith mixed with Human Frailty: They had Faith in his Power, that he could ſave them; but being aſleep, they concluded he muſt awake, before he could ſave them: Whereas, tho' his Human Nature was aſleep, yet his Divine Nature neither ſlumbred nor ſlept. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Prevalency of Fear in a time of great and imminent Danger, tho' it may argue weakneſs of Faith, yet it is no Evidence of want of Faith: In the midſt of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> Fears, they believed <hi>Christ</hi>'s Power. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. A double Rebuke given by our Saviour: 1. To the Winds and Seas, next, to the Fears of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples: He rebukes the Winds and the Seas,</hi> and inſtantly <hi>they are calm;</hi> when the Sea was as furious as a Mad-man, Chriſt by his Divine Power calms it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the moſt raging Winds and outrageous Seas, cannot ſtand before the Rebukes of Chriſt; if once he Rebukes them, their Rage is down: GOD lays a Law upon the moſt Lawleſs Creatures, even when they ſeem to act moſt lawleſly. 2. Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:15"/> rebukes his <hi>Diſciples</hi> Fears, <hi>Why are ye fearful?</hi> No ſooner was the Storm up, but their Fears were up; they forgat that the Lord High-Admiral of the Ocean was on-board the Ship; and were as much over-ſett with their <hi>Boiſterous Paſſions,</hi> as the Veſſel was with the <hi>Tempeſtuous Winds;</hi> and accordingly Chriſt rebukes the Tempeſt within, and then the Tempeſt without; firſt he calms their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and then the <hi>Seas.</hi> From this Inſtance we ſee, that great Faith in the Habit, may appear little in Act and Exerciſe: The <hi>Diſciples</hi> Faith in forſaking all and following Chriſt, was great Faith; but in this preſent Act, their Faith was weak, through the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Fear.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And when he was come to the other ſide, into the country of the Gergeſenes, there met him two poſſeſſed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, ſo that no man might paſs by that way.</p>
               <p>We read of few, if any, in the Old Teſtament, that were poſſeſt with Evil Spirits, but of many in the New Teſtament. Our Saviour came into the World to deſtroy the Works of the Devil; therefore he ſuffered Satan to enter ſome Human Bodies, to ſhew his Divine Power in caſting them out. <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. That the Evil Angels by their Fall loſt their Purity, but not their Power. 2. That they do no oftner exert their Power in doing Miſchief to the Bodies and Lives of Men, is from the Reſtraining-Power of GOD, the Devils cannot do all the Miſchief they would, and they ſhall not do all they can.</p>
               <p n="29">29 And behold, they cried out, ſaying, What have we to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The Devils knew Chriſt to be the Son of GOD, and that he came into the World to be a Saviour, but not their Saviour; therefore they cry out, <hi>What have we to do with Thee?</hi> Or Thou with us? Oh what an uncomfortable Faith is this, to believe that Chriſt is a Saviour, and at the ſame time to know that he is none of our Saviour! But what is their Out-cry againſt Chriſt? This, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time? Learn,</hi> 1. That there are Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures appointed to the Spiritual Natures of Evil Angels. The Fire of Hell is conceived to be, partly Material, and partly Spiritual; partly Material, to work upon the Bodies of Evil Men; and partly Spiritual, to work upon the Souls of Men, and the Spirits of Evil Angels. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That tho' the Devils be now as full of Diſcontent as they can be, yet they are not ſo full of Torment as they ſhall be; their Speech here intimates, that there will be a time when their Torments ſhall be increaſed, when they ſhall have their fill of Torment: Therefore they pray, Increaſe not our <hi>Torments,</hi> before the appointed Time of their Encreaſe.</p>
               <p n="30">30 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many ſwine, feeding. 31 So the devils beſought him, ſaying, If thou caſt us out, ſuffer us to go away into the herd of ſwine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A notable Evidence of Satan's <hi>Limited Power,</hi> that a whole Legion of Devils had not Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one Man, nor were able to hurt the meaneſt Creature without Permiſſion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Devils Acknowledgment of their own Impotency, and Chriſt's Power; their Asking Leave of Chriſt to go into the Swine, ſhews that they could not go of themſelves. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. The <hi>Reſtleſneſs</hi> of Satan's Malice; he will hurt the Swine, rather than not hurt at all. 2. That tho' Satan's Malice be infinite, yet his Power is limited and bounded; as he cannot do all the Miſchief he would, ſo he ſhall not do all he can.</p>
               <p n="32">32 And he ſaid unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of ſwine: and behold, the whole herd of ſwine ran violently down a ſteep place into the ſea, and periſhed in the waters.</p>
               <p>Altho' Chriſt ſeldom wrought any Deſtructive Miracle, and altho' he certainly foreſaw, that the Swine would periſh in the Waters; yet that the People might ſee, how great the Power and Malice of the Devil would be, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Chriſt, he permitted him to enter into the Swine; Chriſt <hi>ſaid unto them, Go;</hi> and how glad was Satan of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to enter the Swine, in order to their Deſtruction. Let it teach us our Duty, by Prayer to commit our ſelves, and all that we have, Morning and Evening, into the Hands of GOD's Care: All that we have in the Houſe, and all that we have in the Field, that it may be preſerved from the Power and Malice of Evil Spirits.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. What a contrary Effect this Miracle which Chriſt wrought, had upon theſe People: Inſtead of Believing on him for his Miraculous Cure of the Poſſeſſed, the Loſs of their Swine enrages them, and makes them deſire Chriſt to depart from them. Temporal Loſſes are ſo great in Worldly Mens Eſtimation, that Spiritual Advantages are nothing eſteemed. Carnal Hearts prefer their <hi>Swine</hi> before their <hi>Saviour;</hi> and had rather loſe Chriſt's <hi>Preſence,</hi> than their <hi>Worldly Profit. Obſ.</hi> 2. How Unanimous and Importunate theſe <hi>Gadarens</hi> were, to get rid of Chriſt; the whole City came out, and are not only willing with his Departure, but they beſeech him to depart out of their Coaſts. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That deplorably ſad is the Condition of ſuch from whom Chriſt departs; more deplorably ſad their State, who <hi>ſay</hi> unto Chriſt, depart; but moſt deplorably ſad is the Caſe of them that <hi>intreat</hi> and <hi>beſeech</hi> Chriſt to depart from them: Thus did theſe <hi>Gadarens,</hi> and accordingly Chriſt took Ship and departed from them, and we never read of his return more unto them.</p>

               <p>See here how the beſt of Men are ſometimes charged with ſaying and doing the worſt of things; to Do well, and Hear ill, was the Portion of Chriſt himſelf; and may be the Portion of the holieſt of thoſe that belong to Chriſt: The Innocent <hi>Jeſus</hi> was accuſed of Blaſphemy, of Sorcery, and of the blackeſt Crimes.

               <p>Our Saviour here gives the <hi>Phariſees</hi> a Twofold Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Godhead: <hi>First,</hi> By letting them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he knew their Thoughts; for to ſearch the Hearts, and to know the Thoughts of the Children of Men, is not in the Power either of Angels or Men, but the Prerogative of God only. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By aſſuming to himſelf a Power to Forgive Sins; the Son of Man hath Power to Forgive <hi>Sins.</hi> Our Saviour here, by Forgiving Sins in his own Name, and by his own Authority, doth give the World an undeniable Proof, and convincing Evidence of his Godhead; for, <hi>Who can Forgive Sins, but GOD only?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> The Multitude marvelled, but not believed; they admire our Saviour for an Extraordinary Man, but did not believe in him, as the Son of God: They praiſe God, for giving ſuch Power to Heal the Bodies of Men; but not for ſending his Son into the World, to Save the Souls of Men. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the ſight of Chriſt's Miracles is not ſufficient to work Faith in the <hi>Soul,</hi> but requires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Operation of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> the one may make us marvel, the other muſt make us believe.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And as Jeſus paſſed forth from thence, he ſaw a man, named Matthew, ſitting at the receit of cuſtom: and he ſaith unto him, Follow me. And he aroſe, and followed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> The Number of our Lord's Apoſtles not being filled up, what a ſtrange Election and Choice he makes; <hi>Matthew,</hi> a grinding <hi>Publican,</hi> is the Man. <hi>Learn,</hi> Such is the Freeneſs of God's Grace, that it chuſes, and ſuch is the Efficacy of it, that it over-powers and brings in the worſt of <hi>Sinners</hi> unto God; <hi>Matthew</hi> a <hi>Publican, Zaccheus</hi> an Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> a Murderer, <hi>Paul</hi> a Perſecutor; all theſe are brought home to God by the Power of Converting Grace. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s ready Compliance with God's Call, <hi>He aroſe and followed</hi> Chriſt. When the Inward Call of the <hi>Spirit</hi> accompanies the Outward Call of the Word, the <hi>Soul</hi> readily complies, and preſently yields Obedience to the Voice of God. Chriſt oft-times ſpeaks by his <hi>Word</hi> to our Ear, and we hear not, we ſtir not; but when he ſpeaks by his <hi>Spirit</hi> to our Hearts, <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall not hold us down, the <hi>World</hi> ſhall not keep us back, but we ſhall ariſe, and follow our Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And it came to paſs, as Jeſus ſat at meat in the houſe, behold, many publicans and ſinners came and ſat down with him and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> Chriſt invited <hi>Matthew</hi> to a Diſcipleſhip, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> invites Chriſt to a Feaſt; the <hi>Servant</hi> invites his <hi>Maſter,</hi> a <hi>Sinner</hi> invites his <hi>Saviour.</hi> We do not find, where ever Chriſt was invited to any Table, that he refuſed to go; if a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> if a <hi>Publican</hi> invited, he conſtantly went; not for the Pleaſure of Eating, but for the Opportunity of Converſing, and doing Good: Chriſt feaſts us, when we feaſt him. From <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Example, <hi>Learn,</hi> That new Converts are full of Affection towards Chriſt, and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of their Love unto him. Such as before Converſion Diſeſteemed him, do afterwards kindly and reſpectfully Entertain him: <hi>Matthew</hi> toucht with a ſenſe of Chriſt's <hi>Rich Love,</hi> makes him a <hi>Royal Feast. Obſ. farther,</hi> How at this Feaſt many <hi>Publicanes</hi> and Sinners were preſent, of <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Acquaintance no doubt, and probably invited by him, that they might alſo ſee Chriſt, and be Partakers of the ſame Grace with him. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That Grace teaches a Man to deſire, and ſeek the Converſion of others; and ſuch as are truly brought home to Chriſt themſelves, will ſtudy and endeavour to bring in all their Acquaintance to Chriſt alſo.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And when the Phariſees ſaw it, they ſaid unto his diſciples, Why eateth your Maſter with publicans and ſinners?</p>
               <p>See here, what a Grief it is to Wicked Men, to ſee others brought in to Chriſt; the Wicked <hi>Phariſees</hi> murmur, repine, and envy, inſtead of admiring Chriſt's Condeſcenſion, and adoring his Divine Goodneſs: They cenſure him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with <hi>Sinners;</hi> but Chriſt tells them in the following <hi>Verſes,</hi> that he converſt with them as their Phyſician, not as their Companion.</p>
               <p n="12">12 But when Jeſus heard <hi>that,</hi> he ſaid unto them, They that be whole need not a phyſician, but they that are ſick. 13 But go ye, and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</p>
               <p>As if our Lord had ſaid, With whom ſhould the Phyſician converſe, but with his Sick Patients? Now I am come into the World to do the Office of a kind Phyſician unto Men; ſurely then I am to take all Opportunities to Help and Heal them: They that are Sick need the Phyſician; but for you <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who are whole and well in your own Opinion, and ſwell'd with a Conceit of your own Righteouſneſs, I have no Hopes of doing any Good upon you; for ſuch as think themſelves whole, deſire no Phyſician's Help. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Sin is the <hi>Soul's Malady,</hi> its <hi>Spiritual Diſeaſe</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> 2. That Chriſt is the Phyſician appointed by God, for the Cure and Healing of this <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> and <hi>Malady.</hi> 3. That there are Multitudes <hi>Spiritually Sick,</hi> who yet think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſound and whole. 4. That only ſuch as are ſenſible of their <hi>Spiritual Sickneſs,</hi> are Subjects capable of Cure, and the Perſons whom Chriſt is an Healing Phyſician to: <hi>They that are whole need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick.</hi>

               <p n="14">14 Then came to him the diſciples of John, ſaying, Why do we and the Phariſees faſt oft, but thy diſciples faſt not? 15 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Can the children of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, and then ſhall they faſt. 16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment: for that which is put in to fill it up, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worſe. 17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: elſe the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles periſh: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preſerved.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> themſelves had a Contention with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the foregoing <hi>Verſes;</hi> here they ſet on the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> to contend with him about Faſting; alledging, that the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> faſted often, Chriſt's Diſciples not at all: Our Saviour owns it, that his Diſciples did not faſt at preſent, for two <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſuitable</hi> to them. 2. Becauſe it was <hi>Intolerable</hi> for them. It was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable</hi> to them, becauſe of Chriſt's Bodily Preſence with them; this made it a time of Joy and Feaſting, not of Mourning and Faſting: While Chriſt the Bridegroom is with them, they muſt feaſt and rejoyce; when removed from them, there will be Cauſe enough to faſt and mourn.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:16"/> Chriſt is the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and his Church the <hi>Bride,</hi> which he has Eſpouſed and Married to himſelf; and whileſt his <hi>Spouſe</hi> did enjoy his Bodily Preſence with her, it was a Day of Joy and Rejoycing to her, and Mourning and Faſting was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for her. Again: This Diſcipline of Faſting was at preſent <hi>Intolerable</hi> for the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> for they were raw, green, and tender, and could no more bear the <hi>Severities</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> at preſent, than an old Garment could bear a piece of new ſtiff Cloth to be ſet into it, which will make the Rent worſe, if the Garment comes to a ſtretch; or no more than old Bottles can keep new Wine. Thus ſays Chriſt, My <hi>Diſciples</hi> are young and green, tender and weak, newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; they cannot bear the <hi>Severer Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> preſently; but when I am aſcended into Heaven, I will ſend down my Holy Spirit, which ſhall enable them to all the <hi>Duties</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> injoyns. Hence we may <hi>Gather,</hi> That <hi>Young Converts,</hi> till grown up to ſome Conſiſtency in <hi>Grace,</hi> muſt not be put upon the <hi>Severer Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> but handled with that <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the mild and merciful <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Our Saviour here commends Prudence to his <hi>Miniſters;</hi> that they put not their People upon <hi>Duties</hi> beyond their <hi>Strength,</hi> but conſult their <hi>Progreſs</hi> in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the <hi>Proficiency</hi> they have made in <hi>Religion,</hi> and treat them accordingly.</p>

               <p>The humble Poſture in which this Man came unto Chriſt, namely, falling at his Foot and worſhipping him; which was not only a Sign of tender Affection towards his Daughter, but an Evidence of his Faith in our Bleſſed Saviour; yet his confining Chriſt's Power to his Bodily Preſence, and to the Touch of his Hand, was a Token of the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of his <hi>Faith: Come,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and lay thy Hand upon her, and ſhe ſhall live:</hi> As if Chriſt could not have Cured her, without either coming to her, or laying his Hand upon her. <hi>Note here,</hi> That altho' all that come to Chriſt, are not alike ſtrong in Faith, yet our Bleſſed Redeemer refuſes none that come unto him with a ſincere Faith, tho' in much weakneſs of Faith. <hi>Jeſus aroſe, and followed him.</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour being come to the <hi>Ruler</hi>'s Houſe, finds the People very buſily preparing for the Interrment of the dead Corps, with Muſick and other Solemnities. This Cuſtom of having Muſick at Funerals, came from the Heathens, no mention is made thereof in the Old Teſtament; we read of tearing the Fleſh, ſhaving the Head, eating the Bread of Mourners; alſo of Funeral-Songs, but theſe were only ſung with the Voice; but Inſtruments of Muſick at <hi>Funerals,</hi> came from the Pagans. Weeping and Lamentation are the moſt proper Funeral-Muſick; then, nothing ſounds ſo well as a Sigh, nor is any thing ſo much in ſeaſon, as a Tear: Yet are all Demonſtrations of immoderate and exceſſive Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both hurtful to the Living, and diſhonourable to the Dead; nor is it an Argument of more Love, but an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of leſs Grace. <hi>Obſerve next,</hi> In what ſence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour affirms that <hi>the Damſel was not dead. Mortua est vobis, mihi Dormit,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Jerom; She is Dead to you, but Aſleep to me:</hi> I can as eaſily raiſe her from Death, as you can awake her out of Sleep. Her Soul was ſeparated from her Body, but not yet fixt in its Eternal Manſion. Souls departed are under the Conduct of Angels, good or bad, to their ſeveral Places of Bliſs or Miſery. Probably, the Soul of this Damſel was under the Guard of Angels near her dead Body, waiting the Pleaſure of <hi>Christ</hi> in reference to it; either to reſtore it again to the Body, or to tranſlate it to its Eternal Manſion.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And when Jeſus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and ſaying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us. 28 And when he was come into the houſe, the blind men came to him: and Jeſus ſaith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? they ſaid unto him, Yea, Lord. 29 Then touched he their eyes, ſaying, According to your faith, be it unto you. 30 And their eyes were opened, and Jeſus ſtraitly charged them, ſaying, See that no man know it. 31 But they, when they were departed, ſpread abroad his fame in all that country.</p>
               <p>The Ruler, and others who came to <hi>Christ</hi> for Cure, and Healing, believed him to be a Man, unto whom Almighty God had Communicated Divine Power. But it is obſervable, that theſe poor Blind Men did believe him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> by their calling him the Son of <hi>David;</hi> and according to their Faith, ſo was their Succeſs; their Faith capacitated them for a Cure. But why did our Lord enjoyn the Blind Men Silence, and ſtraitly charge them to tell no Man of the Cure? Herein the great Modeſty and Humility of <hi>Christ</hi> appeared, in avoiding all Oſtentation and Commendation; as alſo a due Care of his own Safety, leſt the publiſhing of his Miracles ſhould create him untimely Danger from the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</hi>

               <p>Still our Lord goes about doing Good; before he Healed the Diſeaſed, here he Helps the Poſſeſſed. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

This Man's Dumbneſs was cauſed by the Devil's Poſſeſſion. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2.

               <argument>
                  <p> This Chapter acquaints us with the First Commiſſion which our Saviour gave his Diſciples, to Preach the Goſpel: He directs them, First, Whither to go, and to whom to Preach; namely, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he calls, <hi>The loſt Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. He inſtructs them Secondly, As to the Doctrine he would have them Preach; namely, the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And Laſtly, He arms them against all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they might meet with in their Miniſtry; and particularly, fortifies them against the Fears of Poverty and Perſecution.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 AND when he had called unto him his twelve diſciples, he gave them power <hi>againſt</hi> unclean ſpirits, to caſt them out, and to heal all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church aroſe from Twelve <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> ſo did the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church become planted by Twelve <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> the Perſon commiſſionating them, was Chriſt. None are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Work and Calling of the Miniſtry, but thoſe whom Chriſt appoints; and the Perſons commiſſionated, were Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2 Now the names of the twelve apoſtles are theſe; The firſt, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the ſon of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee, and John his brother, 3 Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, James the ſon of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whoſe ſirname was Thaddeus, 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iſcariot, who alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> Of the Twelve Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> is named firſt, and <hi>Judas</hi> laſt. <hi>Peter</hi> is named firſt, becauſe probably elder than the reſt: or becauſe for Order-ſake, he might Speak before the reſt: From whence may be inferr'd a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, but no Supremacy; a Priority of Order, but no Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Degree. As the Fore-man of a <hi>Grand-Inquest</hi> has a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, but no Preheminency. <hi>Judas</hi> is named laſt, with a Brand of Infamy ſet upon him, that he was the Traditor, the Perſon that Betrayed his Lord and Maſter. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That tho' the Truth of Grace be abſolutely neceſſary to a <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s Salvation, yet the want of it doth not diſannul his Office, nor hinder the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of his <hi>Miniſtry: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> though a <hi>Traytor,</hi> was yet a <hi>Lawful Miniſter.</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, ſaying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into <hi>any</hi> city of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans enter ye not. 6 But go rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>This was only a <hi>Temporary Prohibition,</hi> whilſt Chriſt was here upon Earth, the <hi>Jews</hi> being Chriſt's own <hi>People,</hi> of whom he came, and to whom he was promiſed, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is firſt Preached to them; but afterwards the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had a Command to Teach all Nations, and after Chriſt's <hi>Aſcenſion, Samaria</hi> received the <hi>Goſpel</hi> by the Preaching of <hi>Philip.</hi> From the <hi>Character</hi> which Chriſt gives of the <hi>Jews,</hi> calling them <hi>Lost Sheep,</hi> we <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Condition of a People before brought home to Chriſt by the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is a <hi>Lost Condition:</hi> Sinners are as <hi>Lost Sheep,</hi> wandring and going aſtray from God, till the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> finds them. 2. That the great Work and Office of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is to call home, and to bring in, loſt Sheep unto Jeſus Chriſt the Great Shepherd. <hi>Go,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>to the lost Sheep,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And as ye go, preach, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The <hi>Duty</hi> injoined the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in order to the bringing home of <hi>Lost Souls</hi> to Chriſt, and that is, <hi>Preaching; As ye go, Preach. Note thence,</hi> That the plain and perſwaſive <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> is the Special Means appointed by Chriſt for the Salvation of Loſt Sinners. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Doctrine they are injoined to Preach, namely, that <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> that is, that the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> was come, and had ſet up his Kingdom in the World, and expected their <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Laws. Where note,</hi> How that the <hi>Preaching</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> was one and the ſame; namely, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Repentance: Repent,</hi> ſay they all, <hi>for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand:</hi> that is, the Time of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Appearing, which has been ſo long expected, is now come.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Heal the ſick, cleanſe the lepers, raiſe the dead, caſt out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</p>
               <p>Here our <hi>Saviour</hi> impowers his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to work <hi>Miracles,</hi> for the Confirmation of their Doctrine; but gives them a Charge to work them freely, without making any private Advantage to themſelves. Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. How Beneficial the <hi>Miracles</hi> were, (which <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> wrought) to Mankind. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Miracles,</hi> were as great <hi>Judgments</hi> as <hi>Wonders;</hi> but theſe were Beneficent; they delivered Men from Miſeries, from Bodily Diſeaſes, from the Power and Malice of Evil Spirits: <hi>They healed the Sick, and cast out Devils. Obſ.</hi> 2. That <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> to ſhew himſelf a free Saviour, and that whatever came from him, was the Effect of Free-Grace, gave his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> a Charge to diſpence their Power in working Miracles freely, without Money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Price.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Provide neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in your purſes: 10 Nor ſcrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither ſhoes, nor yet ſtaves: (for the workman is worthy of his meat)</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:17"/>
               <p>This Command of Chriſt was Temporary, and extended only to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> firſt Journey, which they were ſoon to diſpatch: Our Saviour encourages them to truſt God; firſt, for <hi>Protection;</hi> take no Staves with you, that is, no ſtriking or ſmiting Staves for your own defence. Preachers muſt be no Strikers. Tho' a Walking-Staff they might take with them: Itinerant-Preachers might be wearied with Travelling, as well as with Speaking. Next for <hi>Proviſion;</hi> he would not have them over-ſolicitous for that neither; ſaying, <hi>The Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is worthy of his Meat.</hi> As it is a <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s great Duty, to truſt GOD for his Maintenance; ſo it is the <hi>People</hi>'s Duty, to take care for their <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s comfortable Subſiſtence. <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his Hire, and the Work-man is worthy of his Meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 And into whatſoever city or town ye ſhall enter, inquire who in it is worthy: and there abide till ye go thence. 12 And when ye come into an houſe, ſalute it. 13 And if the houſe be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or city, ſhake off the duſt of your feet. 15 Verily I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour proceeds to direct his Diſciples, how to manage this their firſt Journey in Preaching the Goſpel; he injoins them, 1. To obſerve the Rules of Decency, in their going from one Place to another; not like Beggars, wandring from Houſe to Houſe; but having entred a City or Village, to make enquiry, who ſtood beſt affected to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and there turn in. 2. Our Saviour injoins them Civil and Religious Courteſie towards thoſe whom they applied themſelves unto. <hi>When ye come into an Houſe, ſalute it;</hi> give it a Civil Salutation, but eſpecially a Chriſtian and Spiritual Salute, wiſhing them Mercy, Grace, and Peace. 3. He encourages his Apoſtles in the want of Succeſs; if they hear you not, <hi>Shake off the Dust of your Feet.</hi> This Action was Emblematical, and ſignified, That Almighty God would in like manner ſhake off them, and eſteem them no better than the vileſt Duſt. <hi>Note,</hi> That thoſe who deſpiſe the Meſſage which the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> bring, ſhall hereafter find the Duſt of their Feet, and the Aſhes of their Grave, to give a Judicial Teſtimony againſt them in the Day of CHRIST. Where-ever the <hi>Word</hi> is Preached, 'tis for a Teſtimony againſt them; for if the <hi>Dust</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s Feet bear Witneſs againſt the Deſpiſers of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> their <hi>Sermons</hi> much more.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Behold, I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of wolves: be ye therefore wiſe as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and harmleſs as doves.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour, in this and the following <hi>Verſes,</hi> arms his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> againſt all the <hi>Difficulties, Dangers,</hi> and <hi>Diſcouragements</hi> which they might meet with in the Courſe of their <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> He tells them, he ſent them forth as Sheep amongſt Wolves; intimating thereby unto them, that the Enemies of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> have as great an Inclination from their Malicious Nature, to devour and deſtroy the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt, as Wolves have from their natural temper to devour Sheep: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommends to them, <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Innocence; Be wiſe as Serpents,</hi> to avoid the World's Injuries; and <hi>Harmleſs as Doves,</hi> in not revenging them. The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt muſt not be altogether <hi>Doves,</hi> leſt they fall into Dangers; nor altogether as <hi>Serpents,</hi> leſt they endanger others. For as Piety without Policy is too ſimple to be ſafe, ſo Policy without Piety is too ſubtil to be good. Our Saviour in this <hi>Text</hi> teaches us, That Wiſdom and Innocency ſhould dwell together.</p>
               <p n="17">17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will ſcourge you in their ſynagogues. 18 And ye ſhall be brought before governours and kings for my ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the gentiles. 19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how, or what ye ſhall ſpeak: for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak. 20 For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the ſpirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour lets his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> know, that for their Owning <hi>Him,</hi> and Preaching his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> they ſhould be brought before all ſorts of <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and in all kinds of Courts: But he adviſes them, when they are brought before Kings and <hi>Princes,</hi> not to be anxiouſly thoughtful what they ſhould ſay; for it ſhould be given in that Hour, what they ſhould, Anſwer. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That tho' Truth may be oppoſed, yet Truth's Defenders ſhall never be aſhamed; and rather than they ſhall want a Tongue to plead for it, GOD himſelf will prompt them by his Spirit, and ſuggeſt ſuch Truths to their Minds, as all their Oppoſers ſhall not be able to gainſay.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And the brother ſhall deliver up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to death, and the father the child: and the children ſhall riſe up againſt their parents, and cauſe them to be put to death. 22 And ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake: but he that indureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour goes on in a farther Diſcovery of the World's Hatred, and Enmity againſt the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Preachers</hi> of it; and gives all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general, and his <hi>Miniſters</hi> in particular, to underſtand, That ſuch is the Enmity of the <hi>World</hi> againſt <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of it, that it will overcome and extinguiſh, even the Natural Affection of the neareſt and deareſt Relations towards each other. <hi>Grace</hi> teaches us, <hi>To lay down our Lives for the Brethren;</hi> but <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> teaches Brother to take away the Life of Brother; <hi>The Brother ſhall deliver the Brother to Death.</hi> Yet <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Our Saviour comforts his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> that there will be an end of theſe <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and aſſures them, That if their Faith and Patience did hold out unto the end, they ſhould be ſaved. This is our Comfort, that if our <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> for Chriſt end not in our Life-time, they will end with our Lives.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But when they perſecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I ſay unto you, Ye ſhall not have gone over the cities of Iſrael, till the Son of man be come.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here directs his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to a prudent Care of their own <hi>Preſervation,</hi> and allows them to flee in time of <hi>Perſecution;</hi> aſſuring them, That before they had gone through all the Cities of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Preaching the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he would certainly come in Judgment againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and with Severity deſtroy his own Murtherers, and their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. <hi>Learn,</hi> That <hi>Christ</hi> allows his <hi>Miniſters</hi> the liberty of Flight in time of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that they may preſerve their Lives for future Service. Surely, 'tis no Shame to fly, when our Captain commands it, and alſo practiſes it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. Chriſt by his own Example has Sanctified that State of Life unto us, and by his Command made it Lawful for us.</p>
               <p n="24">24 The diſciple is not above his maſter, nor the ſervant above his lord. 25 It is enough for the diſciple, that he be as his maſter, and the ſervant as his lord: if they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of his houſhold?</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here teaches all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Miniſters,</hi> how unreaſonable and abſurd it is for them, to expect kinder Uſage from an unkind <hi>World,</hi> than he Himſelf met with: Are we greater, holier, or wiſer than He? Why then ſhould we expect better Uſage than he? Was he hated, perſecuted, reviled, murthered, for the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> of his <hi>Life?</hi> Why then ſhould any of us <hi>Think ſtrange of the Fiery Tryal, as if ſome ſtrange thing had befaln us?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. Is it not enough, <hi>That the Diſciple be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord,</hi> but muſt he hope to be above him?</p>
               <p n="26">26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that ſhall not be revealed; and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:17"/> hid, that ſhall not be known. 27 What I tell you in darkneſs, <hi>that</hi> ſpeak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye on the houſe tops.</p>
               <p>Chriſt here exhorts his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to a free Profeſſion, and open Publication of the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> from this Conſideration, That whatever they ſay or do ſhall be brought to light, proclaimed and publiſhed to the World. As Wicked Men have cauſe to fear, becauſe their Evil Deeds ſhall be made evident; ſo Good Men have cauſe to rejoice, becauſe their Goodneſs and Good Deeds ſhall be made manifeſt. Let it be our Care to do Good, and it ſhall be CHRIST's Care to diſcover the Goodneſs which we do, to vindicate it from Miſconſtruction, and ſet it in its cleareſt Light.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul: but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here</hi> the following <hi>Particulars.</hi> 1. An unwarrantable Fear condemned; and that is, the ſinful, ſervile, ſlaviſh Fear of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Man. <hi>Fear not him that can kill the Body.</hi> 2. An holy, aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and prudential Fear of the Omnipotent God commended. <hi>Fear him that is able to kill both Body and Soul.</hi> 3. The Perſons that this Duty of Fear is recommended to, and bound upon; Chriſt's own <hi>Diſciples,</hi> yea, his <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſadors;</hi> they both may and ought to fear him; not only for his Greatneſs and Goodneſs, but upon the account of his Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice; as, <hi>Being able to cast both Soul and Body into Hell:</hi> Such a Fear is not only Lawful but Laudable, not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable but commanded, and well becomes the Servants of God themſelves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The Doctrine which our Saviour Preaches to his <hi>Diſciples;</hi> and that is, the Doctrine of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> which concerns it ſelf for the meaneſt Creatures, even the Birds of the Air, and the Hairs of our Heads, do fall within the compaſs of God's Protecting Care. 2. Here is the Uſe which our Saviour makes of this Doctrine; namely, to fortifie the Spirits of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> againſt all diſtruſtful Fears, and diſtracting Cares. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Divine Care,</hi> and <hi>Gracious Providence</hi> of GOD over us and ours, ought to antidote our Spirits againſt all diſtruſtful Fears whatſoever. If an <hi>Hair</hi> from the <hi>Head</hi> falls not to the Ground without a <hi>Providence,</hi> much leſs ſhall the <hi>Head</hi> it ſelf; if the very <hi>Excrements</hi> of the Body, (ſuch are the <hi>Hair</hi>) be taken Care of by God, ſurely the more noble Parts of the Body, and eſpecially the nobleſt Part of our ſelves, our <hi>Souls,</hi> ſhall fall under his particular Regard.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. That not to confeſs Chriſt, in his Account is to deny him; and to deny him, is to be aſhamed of him. 2. That whoſoever ſhall deny, diſown, or be aſhamed of Chriſt; either in his <hi>Perſon,</hi> in his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or in his <hi>Members,</hi> for any Fear or Favour of <hi>Man,</hi> ſhall with Shame be diſowned, and eternally rejected by Him at the Dreadful Judgment of the Great Day. CHRIST may be Denied three ways. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally,</hi> by an Erroneous and Heretical Judgment. <hi>Verbally,</hi> by Oral Expreſſions. <hi>Vitally,</hi> by a Wicked and Unholy Life.

               <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh here, betwixt the Intentional Aim of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Coming, and the Accidental Event of it.

               <p n="37">37 He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth ſon or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me. 38 And he that taketh not his croſs, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. 39 He that findeth his life ſhall loſe it: and he that loſeth his life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour by theſe Expreſſions, doth not condemn Natural Love and Affection, either to our Relations, or our own Lives; but only regulates and directs it; and ſhews, that our firſt and chief Love muſt be beſtowed upon Himſelf. We may have tender and relenting Affections, towards our dear Relations; but then the Conſideration of CHRIST's Truth and Religion, muſt take Place of theſe; nay, of Life it ſelf; nay, when theſe come in Competition, we are to regard them no more, than if they were the Objects of our Hatred. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>If a Man hate not his Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That all the Diſciples of Chriſt ſhould be ready and willing whenever God calls them to it, to quit all their Temporal Intereſts and Enjoyments, even Life it ſelf; and to ſubmit to any Temporal Inconvenience, even Death it ſelf: And all this willingly, chearfully, and patiently; rather than diſown their Relation to Chriſt, and quit the Profeſſion of his Truth and Religion. 2. That ſuch as for Secular Intereſt, and the Preſervation of Temporal Life, do renounce their Profeſſion of Chriſt and his Religion; they do not only greatly hazard their Temporal Life, but expoſe their Eternal Life to the greateſt Danger. <hi>He that findeth his Life, ſhall loſe it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="40">40 He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me. 41 He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, ſhall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous man's reward. 42 And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</p>
               <p>Here in the cloſe of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> our Bleſſed Saviour encourages his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to Faithfulneſs in their Office; by aſſuring them, that he ſhould reckon and eſteem all the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhewn to them, as done unto himſelf: And to encourage the World to be kind to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> he aſſures them, that even a Cup of cold Water ſhould meet with a liberal Reward: How cold is their Charity, who deny a Cup of cold Water to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt! <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That there is ſome ſpecial and eminent Reward due to the Faithful <hi>Prophets</hi> of GOD, above other Men. 2. That he that ſhall entertain a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and do any good Office for him, under that Name; that is, for his Office-ſake, ſhall be Partaker of that Reward. 3. That the leaſt Office of Love, and Reſpect of Kindneſs and Charity, which we ſhew to any of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, for his ſake, Chriſt accounts it as done unto himſelf, and it ſhall be rewarded by himſelf.</p>

               <p n="1">1 AND it came to paſs, when Jeſus had made an end of commanding his twelve diſciples, he departed thence to teach, and to preach in their cities.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having ſent forth his Twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> to Plant and Propagate the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> we find him in this <hi>Chapter</hi> following them himſelf, in that great and neceſſary Work; <hi>He departed to Teach and to Preach in their Cities.</hi> CHRIST, the Great Biſhop and Shepherd of Souls, ſent not forth the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as his Curates, to labour and ſweat in the Vineyard, whilſt he took his Eaſe at Home; but he followed them himſelf: His Word of Command to them was, <hi>Praeite Sequar; Go ye before, I will follow after. Note,</hi> 1. That Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a great and neceſſary Work, incumbent upon all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt, let their Dignity and Preheminency in the Church be what it will: None of the Servants are above their Lord. 2. That if there be a Diſtinction betwixt <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> (as ſome apprehend) they are both the Work of Chriſt's <hi>Miniſters;</hi> who are obliged from their <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Example to perform both: <hi>Teaching</hi> is in order to the Converſion of Sinners, and <hi>Preaching</hi> in order to the Edification of Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now when John had heard in the priſon the works of Chriſt, he ſent two of his diſciples, 3 And ſaid unto him, Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</p>
               <p>It was not for <hi>John</hi>'s Information, that he ſent his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> to Chriſt, but for their Satisfaction, that he was the true and promiſed <hi>Meſſias; John</hi> was aſſured of it himſelf by a Sign from Heaven at our Saviour's <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> Matth. 3.17. But <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, out of a great Zeal to him their Maſter, envied Chriſt himſelf, and were unwilling to believe any Perſon greater than their Maſter: Therefore <hi>John</hi> out of a Pious Deſign, to confirm his <hi>Diſciples</hi> in the Belief of Chriſt's being the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſends them to our Saviour, to hear the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he taught, and to ſee the <hi>Miracles</hi> which he wrought. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> What a Pious Deſire there is in ſuch as know Chriſt experimentally themſelves, to bring all that belong to them, to a Saving Acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Go, and ſhew John again thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee: 5 The blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the goſpel preached to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Way and Means which our Saviour takes for the Conviction and Satisfaction of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, that he was the true <hi>Meſſias;</hi> he appeals to the Miracles wrought by himſelf, and ſubmits the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by him to the Judgment of their Senſes; <hi>Go, and ſhew</hi> John <hi>the Miracles which you hear and ſee. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Miracles themſelves; <hi>The Blind receive their ſight, the Lame walk, the Deaf hear,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt was all this in a Literal Sence, and in a Myſtical Sence alſo, he was an Eye of Underſtanding to the Ignorant, a Foot of Power to the Weak: He opened an Ear in deaf Hearts, to receive the Word of Life: And the Poor are Evangelized; that is, turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> hear the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but the <hi>Poor</hi> receive it; that is, they feel the powerful Impreſſions of it: As we ſay, ſuch a one is <hi>Italianized,</hi> when his Carriage is ſuch, as if he were a Natural <hi>Italian.</hi> The Paſſive Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denotes, <hi>Non Actum Praedicationis, ſed Effectum Evangelii Praedicati;</hi> the <hi>Good Effect</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> had upon the Hearts and Lives of the Poor, transforming them into the likeneſs of it ſelf. <hi>Learn,</hi> It is a Bleſſed Thing, when the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> has ſuch a powerful Influence upon the Minds of Men, that the Temper of their Minds, and the Actions of their Lives are a lively Tranſcript of the Spirit and Temper of the Holy JESUS.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here, by pronouncing them <hi>Bleſſed that are not offended in him,</hi> doth intimate the Miſery of thoſe who ſtumble at him, and to whom he is a Rock of Offence. Some are offended at the <hi>Poverty</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> others are offended at the <hi>Sublimity</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Some are offended at his <hi>Croſs,</hi> others are offended at his <hi>Free Grace:</hi> But ſuch as inſtead of being Offended at CHRIST, Believe in him, and bottom their Expectations of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> upon him, are in a Happy and Bleſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: <hi>Bleſſed is he, that ſhall not be offended in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 And as they departed, Jeſus began to ſay unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderneſs to ſee? A reed ſhaken with with the wind? 8 But what went ye out for to ſee? A man cloathed in ſoft raiment? behold, they that wear ſoft cloathing, are in king's houſes. 9 But what went ye out for to ſee? A prophet? yea, I ſay unto you, and more than a prophet. 10 For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having given Satisfaction to <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, next enters upon a large Commendation of <hi>John</hi> himſelf: Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The <hi>Perſons</hi> whom he commended him before; not <hi>John</hi>'s own <hi>Diſciples,</hi> for they had too high an Opinion of their Maſter already, and were ſo much addicted to <hi>John,</hi> that they envied Chriſt for his ſake: See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Behold, Christ Baptizeth, and all Men come unto him.</hi> It was a great Eye-ſore, that Chriſt had more <hi>Hearers</hi> and <hi>Followers</hi> than <hi>John;</hi> therefore not before <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Diſciples,</hi> but before the <hi>Multitude,</hi> Chriſt commends <hi>John:</hi> For as <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> had too high, ſo the <hi>Multitude</hi> had too low an Opinion of him; poſſibly becauſe of his <hi>Impriſonment</hi> and <hi>Sufferings.</hi> There was a time, when the People had high Thoughts of <hi>John,</hi> but now they undervalued him. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> The great uncertainty of <hi>Popular Applauſe;</hi> the People <hi>contemn</hi> to day, whom they <hi>admired</hi> yeſterday; he who to day is <hi>cried up,</hi> to morrow is <hi>troden down.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> are the ſame, but this proceeds from the <hi>Fickleneſs</hi> and <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> of the People; nothing is ſo mutable as the Mind of Man, nothing ſo variable as the Opinion of the Multitude. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The <hi>Time</hi> when our Saviour thus commended <hi>John;</hi> not in the time of his <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> when the People flockt after him, and <hi>Herod</hi> got him to Court, and reverenced him; but when the giddy Multitude had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> him, and he was faln into <hi>Diſgrace</hi> at Court, and had Preacht himſelf into a Priſon: Now Chriſt vindicates his <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> maintains his <hi>Honour,</hi> proclaims his <hi>Worth;</hi> and tells the People, that the World was not worthy of ſuch a Preacher as <hi>John</hi> was. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Chriſt will ſtand by, and ſtick faſt to his Faithful <hi>Miniſters,</hi> when all the <hi>World</hi> forſakes them. Let the <hi>World</hi> ſlight and deſpiſe them at their pleaſue, yet <hi>Christ</hi> will maintain their <hi>Honour,</hi> and ſupport their <hi>Cauſe;</hi> as they bear a Faithful Witneſs to Chriſt, ſo Chriſt will bear Witneſs to their Faithfulneſs for him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Commendation it ſelf. Our Saviour commends <hi>John,</hi> 1. For his <hi>Conſtancy;</hi> he was not a <hi>Reed ſhaken with the Wind;</hi> that is, a Man of an unſtable and unſetled Judgment, but fixt and ſtedfaſt. 2. For his <hi>Sobriety</hi> and high Meaſures of <hi>Mortification;</hi> he was no delicate voluptuous Perſon, but grave, ſober, and ſevere; he was mortified to the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> to the <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>World. John</hi> wrought no Miracles, but his <hi>Holy Converſation</hi> was as effectual as <hi>Miracles,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the People. 3. For his <hi>Humility;</hi> he might have been what he would; the People were ready to cry him up for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Christ</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>John</hi>'s lowly Spirit refuſes all; <hi>He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and denied not; ſaying, I am not the Christ,</hi> but a poor <hi>Miniſter</hi> of his, willing, but not worthy to do him Service. This will commend our <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of our People; when we ſeek not our own Glory, but the Glory of Chriſt. 4. Our Saviour commends <hi>John</hi> for his clear <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Revealing</hi> of CHRIST to the People: <hi>He was more than a Prophet,</hi> verſ. 9. becauſe he pointed out Chriſt more clearly and fully than any before him. The Ancient <hi>Prophets</hi> ſaw Chriſt afar off; <hi>John</hi> beheld him Face to Face; they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him, he pointed at him, ſaying, This is He. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Clearer any <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is in diſcovering of CHRIST, the more Excellent it is.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Verily I ſay unto you, Among them that are born of women, there hath not riſen a greater than John the Baptiſt: notwithſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:18"/> he that is leaſt in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having highly commended <hi>John</hi> in the ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Verſes,</hi> here he ſets Bounds to the <hi>Honours</hi> of his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;</hi> adding, That tho' <hi>John</hi> was greater than all the <hi>Prophets</hi> that went before him, ſeeing more of Chriſt than all them, yet he ſaw leſs than them that came after him. The meaneſt Evangelical Miniſter that Preaches Chriſt come, is to be preferr'd before all the Old Prophets, who Propheſied of Chriſt to come. That Miniſter who ſets forth the Life, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Is greater in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, has an higher Office in the Church, and a more excellent Miniſtry, than all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yea, than <hi>John</hi> himſelf. The Excellency of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, conſiſts in the Light and Clearneſs of it. Now tho' <hi>John</hi>'s Light did exceed all that went before him, yet it fell ſhort of them that came after him: And thus he that was <hi>Least in the Kingdom of Grace</hi> on Earth; much more, he that is leaſt in the Kingdom of Glory in Heaven, <hi>Was greater than</hi> John.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And from the days of John the Baptiſt, until now, the kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour goes on in commending <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, from the great Succeſs of it; it had that powerful Influence upon the Conſciences of Men, that no Soldiers were ever more violent and eager in the ſtorming and taking a ſtrong Hold, than <hi>John</hi>'s Hearers were in purſuing the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Never any Miniſter (before) diſcovered the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and his Kingdom ſo clearly as <hi>John</hi> did; and therefore never was there ſuch Zeal to preſs into the Kingdom of Heaven amongſt any, as the Hearers of <hi>John</hi> had. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the clearer Knowledge any People have of the Worth and Excellency of Heaven, the more will their Zeal be inflamed in the purſuit of Heaven. 2. That all that do intend and reſolve for Heaven, muſt offer violence in the taking of it; none but the violent are victorious: <hi>They take it by Force.</hi> Which Words are both Reſtrictive, and Promiſſive. They are the violent, and none other, that take it; and all the violent ſhall take it. Tho' careleſs Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours may prove abortive, vigorous proſecution ſhall not miſcarry.</p>
               <p n="13">13 For all the prophets, and the law prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied until John. 14 And if ye will receive <hi>it,</hi> this is Elias which was for to come. 15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p>Here is ſtill a farther Commendation of <hi>John.</hi> The Law and the Prophets, till the coming of <hi>John,</hi> did foretel the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> but not ſo determinately, not ſo nearly, not ſo clearly, as <hi>John</hi> did: And accordingly, he was that <hi>Elias</hi> which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy</hi> foretold ſhould be the Harbinger and Forerunner of Chriſt. But why has <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt the Name of <hi>Elias?</hi> Poſſibly becauſe they were alike zealous in the Work of GOD; they were alike ſucceſsful in that Work, and they were alike perſecuted for their Work; the one by <hi>Jezebel,</hi> the other by <hi>Herodias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 But whereunto ſhall I liken this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is like unto children ſitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 17 And ſaying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced: we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they ſay, He hath a devil. 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they ſay, Behold, a man glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and ſinners: but wiſdom is juſtified of her children.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour in theſe <hi>Words</hi> deſcribes the perverſe Humour of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whom nothing could allure to the Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> neither <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, nor CHRIST's. This our Saviour ſets forth two Ways. 1. <hi>Allegorically,</hi> verſ. 16, 17. 2. <hi>Properly,</hi> verſ. 18, 19. By way of <hi>Allegory,</hi> he compares them to ſullen Children, whom nothing would pleaſe, neither Mirth, nor Mourning: If their Fellows <hi>Piped</hi> before them, they would not <hi>Dance,</hi> if they ſang <hi>Mournful</hi> Songs to them, they would not <hi>Lament.</hi> That is, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were of ſuch a <hi>Cenſorious</hi> and <hi>Capricious</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that GOD himſelf could not pleaſe them, tho' he uſed variety of <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> in order to that End. Next, our Lord plainly interprets this <hi>Allegory,</hi> by telling them, <hi>That</hi> John <hi>came</hi> to them <hi>neither eating nor drinking;</hi> that is, not ſo freely and plentifully, as other Men, being a very auſtere and mortified Man, both in his Diet and in his Habit: And all this was deſigned by God, that the Auſterity of his <hi>Life,</hi> and Severity of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> might awaken the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to Repentance: But inſtead of this, they cenſure him for having a Devil; becauſe he delighted in Solitude, and avoided Converſe with Men. According to the Ancient <hi>Obſervation,</hi> that every Solitary Perſon is either an Angel, or a Devil. <hi>John</hi> being thus rejected, Chriſt himſelf comes to them, who being of a free and familiar Converſe, not ſhunning the Society of the worſt of Men, even of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> themſelves, but complying with their <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> and accompanying with them at their Feaſts; yet without the leaſt Compilnace with them in their <hi>Sins.</hi> But the Freedom of our Saviour's <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> diſpleaſed them, as much as <hi>John</hi>'s Reſervedneſs of Temper; for they cry, <hi>Behold a Man gluttonous:</hi> Chriſt's Affability towards <hi>Sinners,</hi> they call Approbation of their <hi>Sins;</hi> and his Sociable Diſpoſition, Looſneſs and Luxury. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the faithful and zealous <hi>Miniſters</hi> of GOD, let their Temper and Converſe be what it will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe the Enemies of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Haters of the Power of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> neither <hi>John</hi>'s Auſterity, nor Chriſt's Familiarity, would gain upon the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> It is our Duty in the Courſe of our Miniſtry, to ſeek to pleaſe all Men for their Good: But after all our Endeavours to pleaſe all, we ſhall pleaſe but very few; but if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> be of the Number of thoſe Few, we are Safe and Happy. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That it has been the old Policy of the Devil, that he might hinder the Succeſs of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to fill the Minds of Perſons with an Invincible Prejudice againſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel. Obſ.</hi> 3. That after all the Scandalous Reproaches caſt upon <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of it; ſuch as are Wiſdom's Children, wiſe and good Men, will juſtifie <hi>Religion;</hi> that is, Approve it in their Judgments, Honour it in their Diſcourſes, and Adorn it in their Lives. <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not. 21 Wo unto thee Chorazin, wo unto thee Bethſaida: for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. 22 But I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having gone thro' the Cities of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Preaching the Doctrine of Repentance, and Confirming his Doctrine with Miracles, and finding multitudes after all his Endeavours remaining in their Impenitency, he proceeds to upbraid them ſeverely for that their Contempt of <hi>Goſpel-Grace: Then began he to upbraid the Cities,</hi> &amp;c. Where, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Cities upbraided, <hi>Chorazin, Bethſaida,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum;</hi> in their Pulpits he daily Preacht, and thoſe Places were the Theatres upon which his <hi>Miracles</hi> were wrought; other Cities only heard, theſe ſaw; but where he Preached moſt, he Prevailed leaſt. Like ſome Fiſher-men, he catcht leaſt in his own Pond. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. What he upbraids them for; not for Diſreſpect to his Perſon, but for Diſobedience to his Doctrine; <hi>Becauſe they repented not.</hi> The great Deſign of Chriſt, both in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he preached, and in the <hi>Miracles</hi> which he wrought, was to bring Men to Repentance; that is, to forſake their Sins, and Live well. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Whom he upbraids them with; <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> Nations rude and barbarous, out of the Pale of the Church; ignorant of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and of the Way of <hi>Salvation</hi> by him. Therefore inſtead of Wooing them, he denounces Woes againſt them. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the higher a People riſe under the Means, the lower they fall, if they miſcarry. They that have been neareſt to Converſion,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:19"/> and yet not converted, ſhall have the greateſt Condemnation when they are judged. <hi>Capernaum</hi>'s Sentence ſhall exceed <hi>Sodom</hi>'s for Severity, becauſe ſhe exceeded <hi>Sodom</hi> in the Enjoyment of Means and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, ſhalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But when the Phariſees ſaw it, they ſaid unto him, Behold, thy diſciples do that which is not lawful to do on the ſabbath day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The <hi>Perſons</hi> finding Fault with this Action of the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> many of whom accompanied our Saviour, not out of any good Intention, but only with a Deſign to cavil at, and quarrel with every thing, that either Chriſt or his Diſciples ſaid or did. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The <hi>Action</hi> which they found fault with; <hi>The Diſciples plucking of the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath-day.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> It is not the Theft, which the <hi>Diſciples</hi> are accuſed for by the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> For to take in our Neceſſity ſo much of our Neighbour's Goods, as we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and knew our Circumſtances, he would give us, is no Theft; but it is the ſervile Labour on the Sabbath, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Corn, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſcruple. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> How zealous <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are for the leſſer Things of the Law, whilſt they neglect the weightier; and how ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to <hi>Outward Ceremonies,</hi> placing all <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Obſervation of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But he ſaid unto them, Have ye not read what David did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him, 4 How he entred into the houſe of God, and did eat the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the prieſts? 5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the ſabbath-days the prieſts in the temple profane the ſabbath, and are blameleſs? 6 But I ſay unto you, that in this place is <hi>one</hi> greater than the temple.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>Words,</hi> our Saviour defends the <hi>Action</hi> of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> in plucking the Ears of <hi>Corn</hi> in their Neceſſity, by a double Argument: 1. From <hi>David</hi>'s Example; Neceſſity freed him from Fault in eating the Conſecrated Bread, which none but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> might lawfully eat; for in Caſes of Neceſſity, a <hi>Ceremonial Precept</hi> muſt give place to a <hi>Moral Duty;</hi> Works of Mercy and Neceſſity, for preſerving our Lives, and the better fitting us for Sabbath-Services, are certainly lawful on the Sabbath-Day. 2. From the Example of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the Temple, who upon the Sabbath do break the outward Reſt of the Day, by Killing their Sacrifices, and many other Acts of Bodily Labour; which would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Sabbath-Prophanation, did not the Service of the Temple require and juſtifie it. Now ſaith our Saviour, If the Temple-Service can juſtifie Labour on the Sabbath, I am greater than the Temple, and my Authority and Service can juſtifie what my <hi>Diſciples</hi> have done. From the whole we <hi>Learn,</hi> That Acts of Mercy, which tend to fit u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>r Works of Piety, not only may, but ought to be done on the Sabbath-Day.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Law of <hi>Mercy</hi> is much more excellent than the Law of <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and where both cannot be obſerved, the leſs muſt give place to the greater. God never intended, that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of his Service in the Firſt Table, ſhould hinder <hi>Works of Mercy</hi> preſcribed in the Second Table. All GOD's <hi>Commands</hi> are for Man's <hi>Good.</hi> Where both cannot be obeyed, he will have the <hi>Moral Duty</hi> performed, and the <hi>Ceremonial Service</hi> omitted: <hi>He will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice;</hi> that is, he will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice, where both cannot be had.</p>
               <p n="8">8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the ſabbath-day.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, I, who am Lord of the Sabbath, declare to you, that I have a Power to diſpence with the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of it; and it is my Will, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> which was appointed for Man, ſhould yield to Man's Safety and Welfare. Chriſt the Son of Man, was really the Son of GOD; and as ſuch, had Power over the Sabbath, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with it, yea, to abrogate and change it at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their ſynagogue. 10 And behold, there was a man which had his hand withered: and they asked him, ſaying, Is it lawful to heal on the ſabbath-days? that they might accuſe him. 11 And he ſaid unto them, What man ſhall there be among you, that ſhall have one ſheep, and if it fall into a pit on the ſabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 12 How much then is a man better than a ſheep? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the ſabbath-days.</p>
               <p>Here we have another Diſpute betwixt our Saviour and the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> concerning the Sabbath; Whether it be a Breach of that Day, mercifully to Heal a Perſon having a withered Hand? Chriſt confutes them from their own Practice, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that they themſelves judg'd it Lawful to help out a Sheep, or an Ox, if faln into a Pit on that Day: How much more ought the <hi>Life</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> to be preferr'd? Here we may remark, how Inveterate a Malice the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had againſt our Saviour, when they could find no Crime to charge him with, they blame him for working a merciful and miraculous Cure upon the Sabbath-Day. When Envy and Malice (which are evermore quick-ſighted) can find no Occaſion of Quarrel, it will invent one, againſt the Innocent.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Then ſaith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand: and he ſtretched it forth; and it was reſtored whole like as the other. 14 Then the phariſees went out, and held a council againſt him, how they might deſtroy him. 15 But when Jeſus knew it, he withdrew himſelf from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all, 16 And charged them that they ſhould not make him known:</p>

The prudent <hi>Means</hi> which our Saviour uſes for his own Preſervation, <hi>He withdrew himſelf.</hi> Chriſt's Example teaches his <hi>Miniſters</hi> their Duty; to avoid the Hands of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,</hi> and prudently to preſerve their Lives, unleſs when their Sufferings are like to do more good than their Lives. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The great <hi>Humility</hi> of Chriſt, in concealing his own Praiſes; he had no Ambition that the Fame of his Miracles ſhould be ſpread abroad, for he ſought not his own Glory; neither would he by the Noiſe of his Miracles, enrage the <hi>Phariſees</hi> againſt him to take away his Life; knowing that his Time was not yet come, and he had much Work to do before his Death.</p>

               <p>As a farther Inſtance of Chriſt's Miraculous Power, he Healeth one whom the Devil had caſt into a Diſeaſe, which depriv'd him both of Speech and Sight: At this Miracle the Multitude wonder, ſaying, <hi>Is not this the Son of David?</hi> That is, the promiſed <hi>Meſſias:</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> hearing this, with great Bitterneſs and Contempt ſaid, <hi>This Fellow caſteth out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.

When the Holy and Innocent JESUS was thus aſſaulted, what Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if we his Sinful <hi>Servants</hi> be Branded on all ſides by Reviling <hi>Tongues?</hi> Why ſhould we expect better Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the Son of GOD?</p>
               <p n="25">25 And Jeſus knew their thought, and ſaid unto them, Every kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to deſolation: and every city or houſe divided againſt it ſelf, ſhall not ſtand: 26 And if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelf; how ſhall then his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtand? 27 And if I by Beelzebub caſt out devils, by whom do your children caſt them out? therefore they ſhall be your judges. 28 But if I caſt out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. 29 Or elſe, how can one enter into a ſtrong man's houſe, and ſpoil his goods, except he firſt bind the ſtrong man, and then he will ſpoil his houſe? 30 He that is not with me: is againſt me, and he rhat gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour to clear his <hi>Innocency,</hi> and to convince the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of the Unreaſonableneſs of this their <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Falſe Accuſations;</hi> offers ſeveral Arguments to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. 1. That it was very unlikely that Satan ſhould lend him this <hi>Power,</hi> to uſe it againſt himſelf. As Satan has a Kingdom, ſo he has Wit enough to preſerve his Kingdom, and will do nothing to weaken his own Intereſt. Now if I have received my Power from Satan, for Deſtroying him and his Kingdom, then is Satan divided againſt himſelf. 2. Our Saviour tells them, they might with as much Reaſon attribute all Miracles to the Devil, as thoſe that were wrought by Him. There were certain <hi>Jews</hi> amongſt themſelves, who caſt out Devils in the Name of the GOD of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> Chriſt asks the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> By what Power theſe their Children Caſt them out? They acknowledged, that thoſe did it by the Power of GOD; and there was no Cauſe, but their Malice, why they ſhould not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leledge that what he did was by the ſame Power. <hi>If I cast out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God is come unto you;</hi> that is, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is come; becauſe he wrought theſe Miracles, to prove that he was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> 3. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Argument to prove, That the Miracles which Chriſt wrought were by the Power of God, and not by the Help of Satan is this; The Devil is very ſtrong and powerful; and there is no Power but God's only, that is ſtronger than his. Now, ſays Chriſt, if I were not aſſiſted by a Divine Power, I could never caſt out this ſtrong Man, who reigns in the World as in his Houſe: It muſt be a ſtronger than the ſtrong Man, that ſhall bind Satan; and who is he, but the GOD of Strength?</p>
               <p n="31">31 Wherefore I ſay unto you, All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the <hi>holy</hi> Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men. 32 And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. How our Saviour makes a Difference betwixt ſpeaking againſt the Son of Man, and ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt. By <hi>Speaking against the Son of Man,</hi> is meant all thoſe Reproaches which were caſt upon our Saviour's Perſon as Man, without reflecting upon his Divine Power as GOD, which he teſtified by his Miracles. Such were their reproaching him with the Meaneſs of his Birth, their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him for a Winebibber, and a Glutton, and the like. But by <hi>Speaking against the Holy Ghost,</hi> is meant, their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and Reproaching that Divine Power whereby he wrought his Miracles; which was an immediate Reflection upon the Holy Spirit, and a Blaſpheming of him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Nature of this Sin of Speaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt: It conſiſted in this, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſeeing our Saviour work Miracles, and caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God; contrary to the Conviction of their own Minds, they maliciouſly aſcribe his Miracles to the Power of the Devil; charging him to be a Sorcerer and Magician, and to have a Familiar Spirit, by whoſe Help he did thoſe Mighty Works; when in truth he did them by the Spirit of God. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. That this Sin above all others, is called Unpardonable, and upon what Account it is ſo: The Caſe of ſuch <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> of the Holy Spirit, is not only dangerous, but deſperate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reſiſt their laſt Remedy, and oppoſe the beſt Means for their Conviction. What can God do more, to convince a Man that Jeſus Chriſt is the True <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> than to work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>cles to that purpoſe? Now if when Men ſee plain Miracles wrought, they will ſay, it is not God that works them, but the Devil; as if Satan would conſpire againſt himſelf, and ſeek the Ruin of his own Kingdom. There is no way left to convince ſuch Perſons, but they muſt and will continue in their Oppoſition to Truth, to their inevitable Condemnation.</p>

               <p>Theſe Words may either referr to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or to Chriſt himſelf. If to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the Sence is, You hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſhew your ſelves what you are, by your <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> even as the <hi>Fruit</hi> ſheweth what the <hi>Tree</hi> is.

The Expreſſion implies, That a

Now this is called a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> not for the Preciouſneſs of it, but for the Abundance of it; a little doth not make a Treaſure: And alſo for the Continuance of it; tho' it be perpetually overflowing in the Life, yet doth the Heart continue full; this Treaſure of <hi>Original Corruption</hi> in Man's Nature, it may be drawn low in this Life by Sanctifying Grace; but it can never be drawn dry. 2. Here is a <hi>Good Treaſure</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> diſcovered, in a Sanctified and Renewed Man; which is the Source and Spring from whence all Gracious Actions do proceed and flow: For as the Heart of Man by Nature is the Fountain, from whence all Sin ſprings, ſo the Heart renewed by Grace, is the Source and Spring from whence all Gracious Actions do proceed and flow.</p>
               <p n="36">36 But I ſay unto you, That every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>There are Two Sorts of <hi>Words,</hi> for which we muſt be Judged; Sinful Words, and Idle Words. Sinful Words are Blaſphemous Words, Cenſorious Words, Lying and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Words. Idle Words, are ſuch as favour nothing of Wiſdom or Piety; that have no tendency to make Men either Wiſer, or Better: How light ſoever Men make of their <hi>Words</hi> now, yet in GOD's Balance another Day they will be found to weigh very heavy.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Argument which our Saviour uſes, to move us to Watchfulneſs over our <hi>Words; By our Words we ſhall be juſtified;</hi> not Meritoriouſly, but Declaratively: <hi>Good Words</hi> declare <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in our ſelves, and we ſhall be declared <hi>Good</hi> to others by our <hi>Words;</hi> if our <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> do correſpond and agree with one another. <hi>Death and Life are in the Power of the Tongue:</hi> That is, according to the right or wrong Uſing of the Tongue, we may judge and gather whether Men are Dead or Alive, as to God; and bound for Heaven, or Hell.</p>
               <p n="38">38 Then certain of the ſcribes and of the Phariſees anſwered, ſaying, Maſter, we would ſee a ſign from thee. 39 But he anſwered and ſaid to them, An evil and adulterous generation ſeeketh after a ſign, and there ſhall no ſign be given to it, but the ſign of the prophet Jonas. 40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly: ſo ſhall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41 The men of Niniveh ſhall riſe in judgment with this generation, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 42 The queen of the ſouth ſhall riſe up in the judgment with this generation, and ſhall condemn it: for ſhe came from the uttermoſt parts of earth to hear the wiſdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Requeſt which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> make to Chriſt; <hi>Maſter, we would ſee a Sign from thee.</hi> But had not Chriſt ſhewed them ſigns enough already? What, were all the Miracles wrought in their ſight, but convincing Signs that he was the true <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but Infidelity mixt with Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, is never ſatisfied. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Our Saviour's Anſwer to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Requeſt; he tells them that they ſhould have one Sign more, to wit, that of his <hi>Reſurrection from the Dead: For as</hi> Jonas <hi>lay buried Three Days in the Whale's Belly,</hi> and was then wonderfully reſtored: So ſhould (and did) our Saviour continue in the Grave part of Three Natural Days, and then riſe again. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. How CHRIST declares the Inexcuſableneſs of their State, who would not be convinced by the former Miracles he had wrought, that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> nor yet be brought to Believe in him by this laſt Sign or Miracle of his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> The <hi>Ninivites</hi> ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>Phariſees, They repented at the Preaching of</hi> Jonas; but theſe would not be convinced by the Preaching and Miracles of JESUS: <hi>The Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>alſo, who came from the South to hear and admire the Wiſdom of</hi> Solomon, <hi>ſhall riſe up in Judgment,</hi> againſt thoſe that reject CHRIST, who is the Wiſdom of the Father; and the Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him, which was the Power of God, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Sins of Infidelity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency are exceedingly heightned, and their Guilt aggravated, from the Means afforded by God to bring a People to Faith and Obedience. The Sin of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Rejecting Chriſt's Miracles and Miniſtry, was by far greater than that of the <hi>Ninevites;</hi> had they rejected <hi>Jonas</hi> his Meſſage and Miniſtry, ſent by God amongſt them.</p>

Even ſo ſhall it be alſo unto this wicked generation.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this <hi>Parable,</hi> is to ſhew that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> by rejecting the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and refuſing to Believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> were in a ſeven-fold worſe Condition, than if the <hi>Goſpel</hi> had never been Preacht to them, and a <hi>Saviour</hi> had never came among them; becauſe by our Saviour's Miniſtry Satan was in ſome ſort caſt out: But for rejecting Chriſt and his Grace, Satan had got a ſeven-fold ſtronger Poſſeſſion of them now, than before. From this Parable, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Satan is an Unclean Spirit; he has loſt his Original Purity, his Holy Nature, in which he was created; and is become univerſally filthy in himſelf; no Means being allowed him by God, for the purging of his filthy and unclean Nature. Nay he is a perfect Enemy to Purity and Holineſs, maligning all that love it, and would promote it. 2. That Satan is a reſtleſs and unquiet Spirit; being caſt out of Heaven, he can reſt no where; when he is either gone out of a Man thro' Policy, or caſt out of a Man by Power, he has no Content or Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, till he returns into a filthy Heart, where he delights to be as the Swine in miry places. 3. That wicked and prophane Sinners have this unclean Spirit dwelling in them; their Hearts are Satan's Houſe and Habitation; and the Luſts of Pride and Unbelief, Malice and Revenge, Envy and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, theſe are the Garniſhings of Satan's Houſe. Man's Heart was God's Houſe by Creation, 'tis now Satan's by Uſurpation, and Judiciary Tradition. 4. That Satan by the Preaching of the Goſpel may ſeem to go out of Perſons, and they become ſober and civilized; yet may he return to his old Habitation, <hi>And the last end of that Man may be worſe than the beginning.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Verity of Chriſt's Humane Nature; he had Affinity and Conſanguinity with Men, Perſons near in Blood to him, called his Brethren, that is, his Coſin-Germans. 2. That the Holy Virgin her ſelf was not wholly free from Failings and Infirmities; for here ſhe does untimely and unſeaſonably interrupt our Saviour, when Preaching to the People, and imployed about his Father's Buſineſs. 3. That Chriſt did not neglect his Holy Mother, nor diſregard his near Relations; but ſhewed, that he preferr'd his Father's Service before them. 4. <hi>Learn,</hi> How dear Believers are to Jeſus Chriſt; he preferrs his Spiritual Kindred, before his Natural. Alliance in Faith, and Spiritual Relation to Chriſt, is much nearer and dearer than Alliance by Blood: To bear Chriſt in the Heart, is much better than to bear him in the Womb. Bleſſed be God, this greateſt Priviledge is not denied to us even now: Tho', ſee Chriſt we cannot, yet love him we may; his Bodily Preſence cannot be enjoyed by us, but his Spiritual Preſence is not denied us. Tho' Chriſt be not ours in Houſe, in Arms, in Affinity, in Conſanguinity; yet in Heart, in Faith, in Love, and Service, he is, or may be, Ours. Verily, Spiritual Regeneration brings Men into a more Honourable Relation to Chriſt, than Natural Generation ever did. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall do the Will of my Father, he is my Brother, Siſter, and Mother.</hi>

               <p>The foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> gave us an Account of an Awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sermon preached by our Saviour to the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> In this <hi>Chapter</hi> we are acquainted with the Continuance of his Preaching to the Multitude: Where three things are <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,</hi> 1. Our Lord's Aſſiduity and unwearied Diligence in Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for this <hi>Sermon</hi> was made the ſame Day with that in the former <hi>Chapter, Verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>The ſame Day went</hi> Jeſus <hi>out, and ſat by the Sea-ſide.</hi> A good Pattern for the Preachers of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to follow. How aſhamed may we be to Preach Once a Week, when our Lord Preacht Twice a Day. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Place our Lord Preacht in, a <hi>Ship;</hi> not that he declined the Temple or the Synagogue, when he had the Opportunity; but in the want of them, Chriſt thought an <hi>Houſe,</hi> a <hi>Mountain,</hi> a <hi>Ship,</hi> no unmeet Place to Preach in. It is not the Place that Sanctifies the Ordinance, but the Ordinance that Sanctifies the Place. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Manner of our Lord's Preaching; it was by <hi>Parables</hi> and <hi>Similitudes:</hi> Which was an Ancient Way of Inſtruction among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and a very Convincing Way; working upon Mens Minds, Memories, and Affections; making the Mind attentive, the Memory retentive, and the Auditors inquiſitive after the Interpretation of the <hi>Parable.</hi> Some are of Opinion, that our Saviour's <hi>Parables</hi> were ſuited to his Hearers Employments; ſome of whom being Husbandmen, he reſembles his Doctrine to <hi>Seed</hi> ſown in the <hi>Field:</hi> For thus he ſpeaks:</p>
               <p n="3">— 3 Behold, a ſower went forth to ſow. 4 And when he ſowed, ſome <hi>ſeeds</hi> fell by the way-ſide, and the fowls came, and devoured them up. 5 Some fell upon ſtony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they ſprung up, becauſe they had no deepneſs of earth: 6 And when the ſun was up, they were ſcorched, and becauſe they had not root, they withered away. 7 And ſome fell among thorns: and the thorns ſprung up and choaked them. 8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty fold, ſome thirty fold. 9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scope</hi> of this Parable is, to ſhew that there are Four ſeveral Sorts of Hearers of the Word, but One Sort only that Hear to a <hi>Saving Advantage:</hi> And to ſhew us the Cauſe of the different <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the Word Preacht. Here <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 1. The <hi>Sower,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles; he, the prime and principal <hi>Sower;</hi> they, the ſecondary and ſubordinate <hi>Seedſmen.</hi> Chriſt ſows his own Field, his Miniſters ſow his Field; he ſows his own Seed, they ſow his Seed. Wo unto us, if we ſow our own Seed, and not Chriſt's. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The <hi>Seed</hi> ſown, the Word of God. Fabulous Legends, and Unwritten Traditions, which the <hi>Seeds-Men</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſow, theſe are not Seed, but Chaff; or, their own Seed, not Chriſt's. Our Lord's Field muſt be ſown with his own Seed, not with mixt Grain. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Word of God preacht is like Seed ſown in the Furrows of the Field. As Seed has a Fructifying Virtue in it, by which it increaſes, and brings forth more of it's own kind; ſo has the Word of God a Quickning Power, to regenerate and make alive dead Souls. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the Seed of the Word where it is moſt plentifully ſown, is not alike Fruitful. As Seed doth not thrive in all Ground alike, ſo neither doth the Word fructifie alike in the Hearts of Men: There is a Difference both from the Nature of the <hi>Soil,</hi> and from the Influence of the <hi>Spirit. Learn,</hi> 3. That the Cauſe of the Word's Unfruitfulneſs, is very different, and not the ſame in all: In ſome, 'tis the Policy of Satan, that Bird of Prey, which follows God's Plough, ſteals away the Precious Seed; in others, 'tis a hard Heart of Unbelief; in others, the Cares of the World, like Thorns, choak the Word, overgrow the Good Seed, draw away the Moiſture of the Earth, and the Heart of the Soil, and hinders the Influences of the Sun. The far greater part of Hearers are fruitleſs and unprofitable Hearers, <hi>Learn,</hi> 4. That the beſt Ground doth not bring forth Fruit alike; ſome good Ground brings forth more, and ſome leſs; <hi>Some thirty, ſome ſixty, and ſome an hundred fold.</hi> In like manner, a Perſon may be a profitable Hearer of the Word, altho' he doth not bring forth ſo great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Fruit as others, provided he brings forth as much as he can.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the diſciples came, and ſaid unto him, Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in parables? 11 He anſwered and ſaid unto them, Becauſe it is given unto you to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Diſciples <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and our Saviour's <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> Their Queſtion is, <hi>Why ſpeakest thou to the People in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> which they do not underſtand? They cannot ſee the Soul of thy Meaning, thro' the Body of thy Parables. Chriſt anſwers, <hi>To you</hi> my Diſciples, and ſuch as you are, who love the Truth, and deſire to obey it, the Spirit <hi>gives</hi> you an Affective, Operative, and Experimental Knowledge, not barely to know theſe things, but to believe them, and feel the Power of them, in and upon your own Hearts: But the Generality of Hearers do ſatisfie and content themſelves with a bare Notional Knowledge of what they hear; a Parable therefore is well enough for them. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Doctrines of the Goſpel are Myſteries. 2. That it is a matchleſs and unvaluable Priviledge, practically and ſavingly to underſtand and know Goſpel-Myſteries. 3. That this Priviledge all are not Sharers in, nor Partakers of, but only
<pb facs="tcp:46556:21"/> thoſe to whom it is given: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom, but to them it is not given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance: but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that he hath.</p>
               <p>That is, whoſoever improves the Meaſures of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſhall obtain farther Meaſures and Degrees of it: <hi>But from him</hi> that doth not improve what he has already received, <hi>ſhall be taken away, that which</hi> to himſelf or others, <hi>he ſeemeth to have;</hi> his Common Gifts, and Moral Endowments. <hi>Learn,</hi> That where there are Beginnings of True Grace, and a right and wiſe Improvement of it, God will make rich Additions of more Grace to the preſent Stock which we have received.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Therefore ſpeak I to them in parables: becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not: and hearing, they hear not, neither do they underſtand. 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Eſaias, which ſaith, by hearing, ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand: and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive. 15 For this peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have cloſed; leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words of our Bleſſed Saviour, as I conceive, have a peculiar Reference and Relation to the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> who attended upon Chriſt's Miniſtry, not with an honeſt ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Mind, to be inſtructed by it, but to carp and cavil at it. Our Saviour tells them, he had formerly ſpoken things very plainly and clearly to them, and alſo wrought Miracles before them, to convince them of the Divinity of his Perſon, and of the Verity of his Doctrine: But they would not believe, either his Perſon or his Doctrine to be from God; and therefore he would now ſpeak to them in dark Parables, that they may be Judicially Blinded; they ſhut their Eyes againſt the cleareſt Light, and ſaid they would not ſee; and now Chriſt cloſes their Eyes, and ſays, they ſhall not ſee. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> To acknowledge the Divine Juſtice, which ſpeaks darkly to them that deſpiſe the Light: Such who ſee, and yet ſee not; they ſhall ſee the Shell, but not the Kernel; they ſhall hear the Parable, but not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Spiritual Sence and Meaning of it. When wilful Blindneſs of Mind is added to Natural Blindneſs, it is a juſt and righteous thing with God, to ſuperadd Judicial Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to give them Obſtinacy of Heart, <hi>His Curſe unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 But bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear. 17 For verily I ſay unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them: and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour pronounces ſuch of his Diſciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers Bleſſed, who received the Truths of the Goſpel ſo far, as they were already taught them; he aſſures them, that they ſhall receive farther Light, and fuller Meaſures of Spiritual Illumination: <hi>Bleſſed are your Eyes, for they ſee. Learn,</hi> That ſuch as have received the leaſt Meaſures of Spiritual Knowledge and Saving Illumination, and do improve it, they are in an happy and bleſſed Condition; for as they are capable of farther Meaſures of Divine Knowledge, ſo ſhall they be Partakers of them.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the ſower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and underſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his heart: this is he which received ſeed by the way-ſide. 20 But he that received the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth it, and anon with joy receiveth it: 21 Yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He alſo that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word: and the care of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choak the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received ſeed into the good ground, is he that heareth the word, and underſtandeth it, which alſo beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty, ſome thirty.</p>
               <p>As if our Lord had ſaid, You my <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who are not ſatisfied with a <hi>Sound of Words,</hi> I will explain to you the Sence and Signification of this Parable: The Scope of which is, to ſhew the different Effects which the Word of God has upon Mens Hearts, and the Reaſon of that Difference. The <hi>Seed</hi> is the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Sower</hi> is the <hi>Preacher,</hi> the <hi>Soil</hi> is the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of Man. Now our Saviour aſſures us, that the Hearts of ſome <hi>Hearers</hi> are like <hi>Highway-Ground,</hi> in which the Seed is not covered with the <hi>Harrow</hi> of Meditation; others are like <hi>Stony-Ground,</hi> in which the Word has <hi>no Root,</hi> no Root in their Underſtandings, Memories, Conſcience, Will, or Affections: But <hi>They are offended,</hi> either at the Depth and Profoundneſs of the Word, or at the Sanctity and Strictneſs of it, or at the Plaineſs and Simplicity of it. Again, ſome Hearers our Lord compares to <hi>Thorny-Ground.</hi> Thorns are Covetous Deſires, which choak the good Seed, ſhadow the Blade when ſprung up, keep off the Influences of the Sun, and draw away the Fatneſs of the <hi>Soil</hi> from the <hi>Seed.</hi> All theſe Effects have Thorns in and among the <hi>Seed:</hi> And the like Effects have Worldly Affections and Covetous Deſires in the Heart of Man, rendring the <hi>Word</hi> unfruitful and unprofitable. But the good Chriſtian hears the <hi>Word</hi> attentively, keeps it retentively, believes it ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, applies it particularly, practiſes it univerſally, and <hi>brings forth Fruit with Patience and Perſeverance;</hi> Fruit that will redound to his Account, in the Great Day of Account. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That no <hi>Hearers</hi> are in Chriſt's Account <hi>Good Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> but ſuch as bring forth the <hi>Fruits</hi> of an holy, humble, and peaceable Converſation. 2. That a Perſon may be a good <hi>Hearer</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> if he brings forth the beſt <hi>Fruit</hi> he can, tho' it be not in ſo great a Proportion as others do: As ſome <hi>Ground</hi> brings forth Thirty, ſome Sixty, and ſome an Hundred-fold; In like manner do all the ſincere <hi>Hearers</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> they all bring forth <hi>Fruit,</hi> tho' not all alike; all in <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Reality,</hi> tho' not all to the ſame Degree, and none to Perfection.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Another parable put he forth unto them, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which ſowed good ſeed in his field: 25 But while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26 But when the blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo. 27 So the ſervants of the houſholder came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt thou not ſow good ſeed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He ſaid unto them, An enemy hath done this. The ſervants ſaid unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he ſaid, Nay; leſt while ye gather up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harveſt: and in the time of harveſt I will ſay to the reapers, Gather ye together firſt the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:22"/>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this Parable is, to ſhew that there is no Expectation of Univerſal Purity in the Church of God in this Life; but as the Tares and the Wheat grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Field, ſo Hypocrites and Sincere Chriſtians are, and will be intermixt in the ſame Church, and can hardly be diſcerued one from the other. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> obſerves, that in the <hi>Eaſtern Countries,</hi> the Tares and the Wheat were ſo like one another whilſt they were in the Blade, that there was no knowing them aſunder. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That in the Outward and Viſible Church there ever has been, and will be a Mixture of Good and Bad, of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Sincere Chriſtians, until the Day of Judgment.</hi> 2. That in that Day, Chriſt will make a thoro' and a perfect <hi>Separation,</hi> and divide the <hi>Tares</hi> from the <hi>Wheat;</hi> that is, the <hi>Righteous</hi> from the <hi>Wicked.</hi> 3. That in the mean Time none ought to be ſo offended at this Mixture in the Church, as to ſeparate from Church-Communion on that Account: until the Harveſt it is not to be expected, that the <hi>Tares</hi> and the <hi>Wheat</hi> ſhould be perfectly ſeparated. Yet <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. That tho' the <hi>Tares</hi> are forbidden to be pluckt up, when fown, yet it is the Churches Duty, all ſhe can, to hinder their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owing. Tho' we muſt not roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Wicked up, yet we muſt prevent the rooting of Wickedneſs all we can. Our Saviour that forbad to pluck up the <hi>Tares,</hi> did not forbid to hinder their Sowing.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Another parable put he forth unto them, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of muſtard-ſeed, which a man took and ſowed in his field. 32 Which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but when it is grown, it is the greateſt among herbs, and becometh a tree: ſo that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. 33 Another parable ſpake he unto them, the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 34 All theſe things ſpake Jeſus unto the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in parables, and without a parable ſpake he not unto them: 35 That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet, ſaying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things which have been kept ſecret from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour's Deſign in this Parable is, to ſhew, how the <hi>Goſpel</hi> from ſmall and little, from unlikely and contemptible Beginnings, ſhould ſpread and increaſe, fructifie and grow up; Like as Muſtard-ſee, one of the ſmalleſt of Grains, grows up to a conſiderable tallneſs; and as a little Leaven turns a great Heap of Meal into its own Nature; ſo the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould ſpread and increaſe, Nations and Countries becoming Chriſtian. <hi>Learn,</hi> That how ſmall Beginnings ſoever the <hi>Goſpel</hi> had in it's firſt Plantation, yet by the Fructifying Bleſſing of God, it has had, and ſhall have a wonderful Increaſe.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Then Jeſus ſent the multitude away, and went into the houſe: and his diſciples came unto him, ſaying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 37 He anſwered and ſaid unto them, He that ſoweth the good ſeed, is the Son of man: 38 The field is the world: the good ſeed are the children of the kingdom: but the tares are the children of the wicked one: 39 The enemy that ſowed them, is the devil: the harveſt is the end of the world: and the reapers are the angels. 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire; ſo ſhall it be in the end of the world. 41 The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire: there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth. 43 Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun, in the king-of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p>The Parable of the <hi>Tares</hi> of the Field, Chriſt is pleaſed to explain to his Diſciples after this manner. The Perſon <hi>Sowing</hi> Good Seed, was himſelf, <hi>the Son of Man;</hi> who firſt Planted the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> The <hi>Field</hi> in which the Seed was ſown, was the <hi>World;</hi> that is, the Church in the World: The <hi>Good Seed,</hi> called <hi>The Children of the Kingdom,</hi> are ſincere Chriſtians: The <hi>Tares,</hi> called <hi>The Children of the Wicked One;</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sinners, and unſound Hypocrites: The <hi>Enemy</hi> is the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Harvest</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> are the <hi>Reapers. Learn,</hi> 1. That the Mixture of the Tares and the Wheat, of the Rghteous and the Wicked, muſt and ſhall remain in the Church unto the End of the World. 2. That in the End of the World, the Angels ſhall perform the Work of Separation, gathering the Righteous from among the Wicked; when every one's Harveſt ſhall be according to his Fruit; <hi>The Righteous ſhining in the Kingdom of their Father, the Wicked cast into a Furnace of Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="44">44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treaſure hid in a field: the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant-man, ſeeking goodly pearls: 46 Who when he had found one pearl of great price, he went and ſold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Treaſure</hi> hid in the Field, and the <hi>Pearl</hi> of great Price, are underſtood, the Grace of the Goſpel, and the Way to Life and Salvation, therein diſcovered: He that is throughly convinced of the Worth and Excellency of Grace, will part with all that he has to purchaſe and obtain them. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Sinner who will have Intereſt in Chriſt, and a Part in Goſpel-Grace, muſt part with all that he has to purchaſe and obtain them: Not part with his Goods and Lands, with his Wife and Children; for theſe are none of his own, but lent him by God for his uſe. His Sins are his own, and nothing elſe; theſe muſt be ſold, not pawn'd: He that will have part in Chriſt, muſt part with all his Sins, and that for ever.</p>
               <p n="47">47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was caſt into the ſea, and gathered of every kind. 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to ſhore, and ſat down, and gathered the good into veſſels, but caſt the bad away. 49 So ſhall it be at the end of the world: the angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt; 50 And ſhall caſt them into the furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this Parable alſo, is to ſet forth the State of the Goſpel-Church, which is like a Floor, where Chaff is mixed with Wheat; a Field, where Tares are mixt with good Corn; a Net, where bad Fiſhes are involved with the good. As the Wheat muſt not be removed out of the Floor, before the time of Winnowing; nor the Tares ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Field, before the time of Reaping; nor the good Fiſhes break thro' the Net to get from the bad, before the time of Separation: So muſt not Chriſtians forſake a Churches Communion, becauſe of the preſent Mixture of Good and Bad in the Church. For a mixt Communion in the Church, and the good Chriſtians communicating with the bad, doth neither defile the Ordinances of Chriſt, nor pollute thoſe that ſincerely join in them.</p>
               <p n="51">51 Jeſus ſaith unto them, Have ye under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all theſe things? They ſay unto him, Yea, Lord. 52 Then ſaid he unto them, Therefore every ſcribe which is inſtructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an houſholder,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:22"/> which bringeth forth out of his treaſure things new and old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The Title, which our Saviour puts upon <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters,</hi> they are <hi>Houſhold-Stewards.</hi> 2. He points out the Office of thoſe Stewards; and that is, to provide for the Houſhold, both with Plenty and Variety. <hi>He must bring forth out of his Treaſure,</hi> in Plenty; and <hi>Things new and old,</hi> for their Variety. There are two Eſſential Qualifications in a Steward, <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Prudence:</hi> He muſt be honeſt and faithful, in bringing out of his own Treaſure, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's; and he muſt be prudent, in bringing things new, as well as old; not new Truths, but old Truths in a new Dreſs; leſt the Houſhold by always feeding upon the ſame Diſh, do nauſeate it, inſtead of being nouriſhed by it.</p>
               <p n="53">53 And it came to paſs, that when Jeſus had finiſhed theſe parables, he departed thence. 54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their ſynagogue, inſomuch that they were aſtoniſhed, and ſaid, Whence hath this man this wiſdom, and theſe mighty works? 55 Is not this the carpenter's ſon? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joſes, and Simon, and Judas? 56 And his ſiſters, are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all theſe things? 57 And they were offended in him.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. Chriſt's tender and compaſſionate Regard to his own Country-men, the People of <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Nazareth;</hi> he Preached to them, <hi>in their Synagogues.</hi> 2. The Effect which his Doctrine had upon them; <hi>They were Aſtoniſhed at it,</hi> but not Converted by it; they Admire, but did not Believe. 3. The Cauſe of their rejecting Chriſt's Miniſtry, was the Meaneſs of his Perſon, the Contemptibleneſs of his outward Condition, the Poverty of his Relations. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?</hi> Mark 6.3. <hi>He is called the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter:</hi> Whence the Fathers concluded, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour during the time of his obſcure Privacy, wrought upon <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, his reputed Father's Trade; and <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays, he made Ploughs and Yoaks. Sure we are, our Lord ſpent no Time in Idleneſs, tho' we are not certain how he imployed his Time before he entred his Publick Miniſtry. <hi>Note,</hi> That the Poverty and Meaneſs of Chriſt's Condition, was that which multitudes ſtumbled at; and which kept many, yea, moſt, from believing on him. None but a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eye, can diſcern Beauty in an humbled Saviour. <hi>Is not this the Son of the Carpenter?</hi> 2. That it is no Impediment to, nor Hindrance of our Faith, that we never ſaw Chriſt's Perſon in the Fleſh, nor knew his Parentage and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for here are his own Country-men, who daily ſaw his Perſon, heard his Doctrine, and were Witneſſes of his Holy Converſation; yet inſtead of believing in him, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him.</p>
               <p n="57">57 — But Jeſus ſaid unto them, A prophet is not without honour, ſave in his own country, and in his own houſe.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour tells them, he doth not wonder that ſo few of his own Country-men, to whom he had been ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly known, did deſpiſe his Perſon, and reject his Doctrine; for a Prophet <hi>generally</hi> has leaſt Eſteem, where he has been brought up; becauſe perhaps the Follies of his Childhood, and Indecencies of his Youth, are remembred and reported to his Diſparagement. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That there is a real Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Honour due, and payable to every Prophet, or Faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. 2. That the Miniſters of Chriſt for the moſt part, have leaſt Honour from their own Country-men, to whom they are beſt known.</p>
               <p n="58">58 And he did not many mighty works there, becauſe of their unbelief.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was unable, becauſe they were unwilling; his Impotency was occaſioned by their Infidelity; he did not, becauſe he would not: And that he would not, proceeded from a Defect in their Faith, not from any Deficiency in Chriſt's Power: Their Unbelief bound his Hands, and hindred the Execution of his Power.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p> The former part of this Chapter gives us an Account of the Death of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, together with the Occaſion of it; which was his plain and faithful Reproving of <hi>Herod</hi> for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs he lived in.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 AT that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jeſus; 2 And ſaid unto his ſervants, This is John the Baptiſt, he is riſen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do ſhew forth themſelves in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. How ſtrange it was, that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould not hear of the Fame of <hi>Jeſus</hi> till now; all the Country and adjoining Regions had rung of his Fame, only <hi>Herod</hi>'s Court hears nothing. Miſerable is that Greatneſs, which keeps Princes from the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. How <hi>Plain</hi> is it from hence, that our Saviour came not at Court, he once ſent indeed a Meſſage to that Fox <hi>(Herod,)</hi> whoſe Den he would not approach. Teaching us by his Example, not to affect, but to avoid outward Pomp and Glory. The Courts of Princes are too often a very bad Air for Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to thrive in. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Miſconſtruction of <hi>Herod,</hi> when he heard of our Saviour's Fame: This (ſays he) is <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, whom I Beheaded. His Conſcience told him, he had offered an unjuſt Violence to an Innocent Man; and now he is afraid that he is come again to be revenged on him for his Head. A Wicked Man needs no worſe Tormenter than his own Mind. Oh the Terrours and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a Guilty Conſcience! How great are the Anxiety of Guilt, and the Fears of Divine Diſpleaſure, than which nothing is more ſtinging, and perpetually tormenting!</p>
               <p n="3">3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in priſon for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias ſake, his brother Philip's wife. 4 For John ſaid unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 5 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, becauſe they counted him as a prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Perſon, that put the Holy Baptiſt to Death; 'twas <hi>Herod,</hi> 'twas <hi>Herod</hi> the King, 'twas <hi>Herod</hi> that invited <hi>John</hi> to Preach at Court, and heard him gladly. 1. It was <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> Son to that <hi>Herod</hi> who ſought Chriſt's Life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. Cruelty runs in a Blood. <hi>Herod</hi> the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of <hi>John</hi> who was the Forerunner of Chriſt, deſcended from that <hi>Herod</hi> who would have murdered Chriſt himſelf. 2. 'Twas <hi>Herod</hi> the King. Sad! That Princes who ſhould always be Nurſing-Fathers to, ſhould at any time be the Bloody Butchers of the Prophets of God. 3. 'Twas <hi>Herod</hi> that heard <hi>John</hi> gladly: <hi>John</hi> took the Ear and the Heart of <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> binds the Hands and Feet of <hi>John.</hi> Oh how inconſtant is a Carnal Heart to good Reſolutions! The Word has oft-times an Awakening Influence, where it doth not leave an Abiding Impreſſion upon the Minds of Men. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Cauſe of the Baptiſt's Death; it was for telling a King of his Crime. <hi>Herod</hi> cut off that Head, whoſe Tongue was ſo bold to tell him of his Faults. The Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which the Prophets of God fall under, is uſually for telling Great Men of their Sins: Men in Power are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Reproof, and imagine that their Authority gives them a Licence to Tranſgreſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The plain Dealing of the Baptiſt in reproving <hi>Herod</hi> for his Crime; which in one Act, was Adultery, Inceſt, and Violence, <hi>Adultery,</hi> that that he took another's Wife; <hi>Incest,</hi> that he took his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wife; <hi>Violence,</hi> that he took her in ſpight of her Husband. Therefore <hi>John</hi> doth not mince the Matter, and ſay, It is not Convenient; but, <hi>It is not Lawful for thee to have her;</hi> it was not the Crown and Scepter of <hi>Herod</hi> that could daunt the Faithful Meſſenger of God. There ought to meet in God's Miniſters, both Courage and Impartiality. <hi>Courage,</hi> in fearing no Faces; <hi>Impartiality,</hi> in ſparing no Sins. For none are ſo great, but they are under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Command of the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:23"/> pleaſed Herod. 7 Whereupon he promiſed with an oath, to give her whatſoever ſhe would ask. 8 And ſhe, being before inſtructed of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid, Give me here John Baptiſt's head in a charger. 9 And the king was ſorry: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, for the oath's ſake, and them which ſat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. 10 And he ſent and beheaded John in the priſon. 11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damſel; and ſhe brought it to her mother.</p>
               <p>Several <hi>Obſervables</hi> are here to be taken Notice of. 1. The Time of this Execrable Murther, it was upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s Birth-Day. It was an Antient Cuſtom among the Eaſtern Kings, to Celebrate their Birth-Days; <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Birth-Day was kept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. <hi>Herod</hi>'s here; both with Blood: Yet theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Stains do not make the Practice unlawful. When we ſolemnize our Birth-Day, with Thankfulneſs to our Creator and Preſerver, for Life and Being, for Protection and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to that Moment; and recommend our ſelves to the Care of his good Providence for the Remainder of our Days: This is an Act of Piety and Religion. But <hi>Herod</hi>'s <hi>Birth-Day</hi> was kept with Revelling and Feaſting, with Muſick and Dancing: Not that Dancing, which in it ſelf is a ſet, regular, harmonious Motion of the Body, can be unlawful; any more than Walking or Running: Altho' Circumſtances may make it ſinful. But from this diſorderly Banquet on <hi>Herod</hi>'s Birth-Day, we <hi>Learn,</hi> That Great Men's Feaſts and Frolicks are too often a Seaſon of much Sin. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Inſtigator and Promoter of the Holy Baptiſt's Death. <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias and her Daughter:</hi> That Good Man falls a Sacrifice to the Fury and Malice, to the Pride and Scorn of a Luſtful Woman; for being a Rub in the Way of her Licentious Adultery. Reſolute Sinners, who are mad upon their Luſts, run furiouſly upon their Gainſayers, tho' they be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God themſelves; and reſolve to bear down all Oppoſition they meet with in the Gratification of their Unlawful Deſires. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. With what Reluctancy <hi>Herod</hi> conſented to this Villany; <hi>The King was ſorry.</hi> Wicked Men oft-times ſin with a troubled and diſturbed Conſcience; they have a mighty Struggle with themſelves, before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Sins; But at laſt, their Luſts get Maſtery over their Conſciences. So did <hi>Herod</hi>'s here: For, 4. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Sorrow, he commands the Fact: <hi>He ſent and Beheaded</hi> John <hi>in the Priſon:</hi> And a threefold Cord tied him to this Performance. 1. The Conſcience of his Oath. See his Hypocriſie; he made Conſcience of a raſh Oath, that made no Scruple of real Murther. 2. Reſpect to his Reputation: <hi>Them that ſat with him,</hi> heard him promiſe, and will be Witneſſes of his Levity, if he do not perform. Inſiſting upon <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of Honour, has hazarded the Loſs of Millions of Souls. 3. A Loathneſs to diſcontent <hi>Herodias</hi> and <hi>her Daughter.</hi> Oh vain and fooliſh Hypocrite, who dreaded the diſpleaſing of a wanton Miſtreſs, before the offending of God and Conſcience. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. Theſe wicked Women not only require the Baptiſt to be Beheaded, but that his Head be brought in a Charger to them. What a Diſh was here, to be ſerved up at a Prince's Table on his Birth-Day? A dead Man's Head ſwimming in Blood! How prodigiouſly inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable is Cruelty and Revenge! <hi>Herodias</hi> did not think her ſelf ſafe, 'till <hi>John</hi> was dead: She could not think him dead, till his Head was off; ſhe could not think his Head off, till ſhe had it in her Hand. Revenge never thinks it has made ſure enough. Oh how cruel is a wicked Heart, that could take Pleaſure in a Spectacle of ſo much Horror! How was that Holy Head toſt by impure and filthy Hands: That true and faithful Tongue, thoſe ſacred Lips, thoſe pure Eyes, thoſe mortified Cheeks, are now inſultingly handled by an Inceſtuous Harlot, and made a Scorn to the drunken Eyes of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Gueſts. From the whole, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That neither the Holieſt of Prophets, nor the Beſt of Men, are more ſecure from Violence, than from Natural Death. He that was Sanctified in the Womb, Conceived and Born with ſo much Miracle, Lived with ſo much Reverence, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; is now at Midnight obſcurely Murthered in a cloſe Priſon. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That it is as true a Martyrdom, to Suffer for Duty, as for Faith: He Dies as truly a Martyr, that Dies for doing his Duty, as he that Dies for profeſſing his <hi>Faith,</hi> and bearing Witneſs to the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 And his diſciples came, and took up the body and buried it, and went and told Jeſus. 13 When Jeſus heard of it, he departed thence by ſhip into a deſart place, apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</p>
               <p>The Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> hearing that their Holy Maſter was thus baſely and barbarouſly Murthered, took up his dead Body and buried it. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are not aſhamed of the Sufferings of the Saints, but will teſtifie their reſpect unto them both living and dead. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> How our Bleſſed Saviour upon the notice of <hi>John</hi>'s Death, flies into the Deſart for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his own Life. Jeſus knew that his Hour was not yet come, and therefore he keeps out of <hi>Herod</hi>'s way. It is no Cowardice to fly from Perſecutors, when Chriſt our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both practiſes it himſelf, and directs us to it, ſaying, <hi>When they perſecute you in one City, flee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And Jeſus went forth, and ſaw a great multitude, and was moved with compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and he healed their ſick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> With what Condolency and tender Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the compaſſionate Jeſus exerciſed Acts of Mercy and Compaſſion, towards the Miſerable and Diſtreſſed. <hi>He was moved with Compaſſion;</hi> that is, toucht with an inward Senſe and Feeling of their Sorrow; <hi>And healed their Sick.</hi> Thoſe that came to Chriſt for Healing, found Three Advantages of Cure, above the Power and Performance of any Earthly Phyſician; to wit, Certainty, Bounty, and Eaſe. <hi>Certainty,</hi> in that all Comers were infallibly cured: <hi>Bounty,</hi> in that they were freely cured, without Charge: And <hi>Eaſe,</hi> in that they were cured without Pain.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And when it was evening his diſciples came to him, ſaying, This is a deſart place, and the time is now paſt; ſend the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themſelves victuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. The Diſciples Pity towards the Multitude, that had long attended upon Chriſt's Miniſtry in the Deſart; they preſuming the People hungry, having faſted all the Day, requeſt our Saviour to diſmiſs them, that they may procure ſome Bodily Refreſhment. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it well becomes the Miniſters of Chriſt to reſpect the Bodily Neceſſities, as well as to regard the Spiritual Wants of their People. As the Bodily Father muſt take Care of the Soul of his Child, ſo muſt the Spiritual Father have reſpect to the Bodily Neceſſities of his Children. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Motion which the Diſciples make on the behalf of the Multitude: <hi>Send them away, that they may buy Victuals.</hi> Here was a ſtrong Charity, but a weak Faith. A <hi>ſtrong Charity,</hi> in that they deſire the People's Relief; but a <hi>weak Faith,</hi> in that they ſuppoſe they could not otherwiſe be relieved, but by ſending them away to buy Victuals: Forgetting that Chriſt who had Healed the Multitude miraculouſly, could as eaſily Feed them miraculouſly, if he pleaſed: All things being equally eaſie to Omnipotency.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But Jeſus ſaid unto them, They need not depart, give ye them to eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. Our Saviour's ſtrange Anſwer to the Diſciples Motion; <hi>They need not depart,</hi> ſays Chriſt. <hi>Need not?</hi> Why, the People muſt either feed or famiſh? Victuals they muſt have, and this being a deſart Place, there was none to be had. Surely then there was need enough. But, 2. Chriſt's Command was more ſtrange than his Aſſertion; <hi>Give ye them to eat.</hi> Alas! Poor Diſciples! They had nothing for themſelves to eat, how then ſhould they give the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to eat? When Chriſt requires of us, what of our ſelves we are unable to perform, it is to ſhew us our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and Weakneſs, and to provoke us to look up to him, <hi>That worketh all our Works, in us and for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17 And they ſay unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fiſhes.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:23"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> What a poor and ſlender Proviſion the Lord of the whole Earth has for his Houſhold and Family; <hi>Five Loaves,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Barley; two Fiſhes,</hi> and <hi>they ſmall: Teaching</hi> us, That theſe Bodies of ours muſt be fed, but not pampered. Our Belly muſt not be our Maſter, much leſs our God. We Read but twice that Chriſt made any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and both times his Gueſts were fed <hi>with Loaves and Fiſhes,</hi> plain Fare and homely Diet. The end of Food is to ſuſtain Nature, we ſtifle it with a Gluttonous variety: Meat was ordained for the Belly, the Belly for the Body, the Body for the Soul, and the Soul for God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> farther, As the quality of this Victuals was plain and courſe, ſo the quantity of it was ſmall and little; <hi>Five</hi> Loaves and <hi>two</hi> Fiſhes. Well might the Diſciples ſay, <hi>what are theſe among ſo many?</hi> The Eye of Senſe and Reaſon ſees an impoſſibility of thoſe Effects which Faith can eaſily apprehend, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power more eaſily produce.</p>
               <p n="18">18 He ſaid, Bring them hither to me. 19 And he commanded the multitude to ſit down on the graſs, and took the five loaves, and the two fiſhes, and looking up to heaven, he bleſſed and brake, and gave the loaves to his diſciples, and the diſciples to the multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. How the Maſter of the Feaſt Marſhals his Gueſts, he commands them <hi>all to ſit down:</hi> None of them Reply, ſit down, but to what? Here are the Mouths, but where is the Meat? We can ſoon be ſet, but whence ſhall we be ſerved? Nothing of this; but they obey and expect. Oh how eaſie is it to truſt God, and rely upon Providence, when there is Corn in the Barn, and Bread in the Cupboard; but when our Stores are all empty, and nothing is before us, then to depend upon an inviſible Bounty, is a true and noble Act of Faith. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Actions performed by our Bleſſed Saviour. <hi>He Bleſſed, and Brake, and gave the Loaves to his Diſciples, and they to the multitude.</hi> 1. <hi>He Bleſſed,</hi> Teaching us by his Example in all our Wants to look up to Heaven for a Supply; to wait upon God for his Bleſſing, and not to ſit down to our Food as a Beaſt to his Forage. 2. He <hi>brake</hi> the Loaves. He could have multiplied them whole, why would he rather do it in the breaking? Perhaps to teach us that we are to expect his Bleſſing in the Diſtribution, rather than in the Reſervation of what he gives us. Scattering is the way to Increaſing: Not Grain hoarded up in the Granary, but ſcattered in the Furrows of the Field, yields increaſe. Liberality is the way to Riches, and Penuriouſneſs the Road to Poverty. 3. Chriſt <hi>gave</hi> the Bread thus broken to his Diſciple, that they might diſtribute it to the Multitude. But why did not our Lord diſtribute it with his own Hand, but by the Hands of his Diſciples? Doubtleſs to win reſpect to his Diſciples from the People. The ſame courſe doth our Lord take in ſpiritual diſtributions. He that could feed the World by his immediate H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd, chooſes rather by the Hands of his Miniſters to the divide the Bread of Life to all Hearers.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, twelve baskets full. 21. And they that had eaten were about five thouſand men, beſides Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children.</p>
               <p>They did all Eat, not a Crumb or a Bit, but to Satiety and Fulneſs; <hi>They did Eat and were filled,</hi> yet twelve Baskets remained: More is left than was at firſt ſet on. So many Bellies, and yet ſo many Baskets filled. The Miracle was doubled by an Act of boundleſs Omnipotency. It is hard to ſay which was the greater Miracle, the miraculous Eating, or the miraculous Leaving. If we conſider what they Eat, we may juſtly wonder that they left any thing; if what they Left, that they Eat any thing. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> Theſe Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though of Barley-Bread and Fiſh-bones, muſt not be loſt; but by our Saviour's Command gathered up. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Houſe-keeper of the World will not allow the loſs of his Orts. Oh how fearful then will the account of thoſe be, who have large and plentiful Eſtates to anſwer for as loſt, being ſpent upon their Luſts in Riot and Exceſs!</p>
               <p n="22">22 And ſtraightway Jeſus conſtrained his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to get into a ſhip, and to go before him unto the other ſide, while he ſent the multitudes away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus conſtrained them,</hi> that is, he commanded them <hi>to go away before him:</hi> No doubt they were very loth to leave him, and to go without him; both out of the Love which they bear to him, and themſelves. Such as have once taſted the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, are hardly drawn away from him; however, as deſirous as the Diſciples were to ſtay with Chriſt, yet at his word of command, they depart from him: Where Chriſt has a Will to command, his Diſciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers muſt have a Will to obey.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And when he had ſent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Chriſt diſmiſſes the Multitude, and then retires to pray; <hi>Teaching</hi> us by his Example, when we have to do with God, to diſmiſs the multitude of our Affairs and Imployments, of our Cares and Thoughts. O how unſeemly is it to have our Tongues talking to God, and our Thoughts taken up with the World. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The place Chriſt retires to for Prayer; a Solitary <hi>Mountain;</hi> not ſo much for his own need, for he could be alone when he was in Company; but to teach us, that when we Addreſs our ſelves to God in Duty, we are to take all the Helps, Furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Advantages we can for the doing of it. When we converſe with God in Duty, O how good is it, <hi>to get upon a Mountain,</hi> to get our Hearts up above the World, above worldly Imployments, and worldly Cogitations. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The occaſion of Chriſt's Prayer: He had ſent the Diſciples to Sea, he foreſaw the Storm ariſing, and now he gets into a Mountain to Pray for them, that their Faith might not fail them when their Troubles were upon them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is the ſingular Comfort of the Church of God, that in all her Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Diſtreſſes, Chriſt is interceeding for her; when ſhe is on the Sea conflicting with the Waves, Chriſt is upon the Mountain praying for her Preſervation.</p>
               <p n="24">24 But the ſhip was now in the midſt of the ſea, toſſed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> The great danger the Diſciples were in, and the great difficulties they had to encounter with; they were in <hi>the midſt of the Sea,</hi> they were <hi>toſſed with the Waves, the Wind was contrary,</hi> and Chriſt was abſent. The Wiſdom of God often ſuffers his Church to be toſſed upon the Waves of Affliction and Perſecution, but it ſhall not be ſwallowed up by them: Often is this Ark of the Church upon the Waters; ſeldom off them; but never drowned.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And in the fourth watch of the night, Jeſus went unto them walking on the ſea.</p>
               <p>Chriſt having ſeen the diſtreſs of his Diſciples on the Shore, he haſtens to them on the Sea. It was not a Stormy and Tempeſtuous Sea that could ſeparate betwixt him and them: He that waded through a Sea of Blood, and through a Sea of Wrath to Save his People, will walk upon a Sea of Water to Succour and Relieve them. But, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The time when Chriſt came to help them, not till the fourth Watch, a little before the Morning. They had been many Hours upon the Waters conflicting with the Waves, with their Fears and Dangers. God oft times lengthens out the Troubles of his Children before he delivers them, but when they are come to an Extremity, that is the ſeaſon of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. As God ſuffers his Church to be brought into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities before he help her. So he will help her in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. <hi>In the Fourth Watch Jeſus came,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And when the diſciples ſaw him walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſea, they were troubled, ſaying, It is a ſpirit; and they cryed out for fear.</p>
               <p>See how the Diſciples take their Deliverer to be a Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Their Fears were higheſt when their Deliverer and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance were neareſt. God may be coming with Salvation and Deliverance for his Church, when ſhe for the preſent cannot diſcern him.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> When the Diſciples were in the ſaddeſt Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how one word from Chriſt revives them; it is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſupport in all our Afflictions, to hear Chriſt's Voice ſpeaking to us, and to enjoy his favourable Preſence with us. Say but, Oh Saviour, <hi>(it is I)</hi> and then let Evils do their worſt: That one word <hi>(it is I)</hi> is enough to lay all Storms, and to calm all Tempeſts.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And Peter anſwered him, and ſaid, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. 29 And he ſaid, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ſhip, he walked on the water to go to Jeſus. 30 But when he ſaw the wind boiſterous, he was afraid: and beginning to ſink, he cried, ſaying, Lord, ſave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The mixture of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt: It was Faith that ſaid, <hi>Maſter;</hi> it was Diſtruſt that ſaid, <hi>If it be thou:</hi> It was Faith that ſaid, <hi>Bid me come to thee:</hi> It was Faith that enabled him to ſtep down on the Watery Pavement: It was Faith that ſaid, <hi>Lord, ſave me:</hi> But it was Diſtruſt that upon the ſight of a mighty Wind, <hi>Feared:</hi> It was Diſtruſt that made him <hi>Sink.</hi> Oh the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect compoſition of Faith and Fear in the beſt of Saints here on Earth! Sincerity of Grace is found with the Saints on Earth: Perfection of Grace with the Saints in Heaven: Here the Saints look forth <hi>Fair as the Moon;</hi> which has ſome Spots in her greateſt Beauty: Hereafter they ſhall be <hi>Clear as the Sun,</hi> whoſe Face is all Bright and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That whilſt <hi>Peter</hi> Believes, the Sea is as firm as Braſs under him; when he begins to Fear, then he begins to Sink. Two Hands upheld <hi>Peter,</hi> the Hand of Chriſt's Power, and the Hand of his own Faith. The Hand of Chriſt's Power laid hold on <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Hand of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith laid hold on the Power of Chriſt. If we let go our hold on Chriſt, we Sink; if he lets go his hold on us, we drown. Now <hi>Peter</hi> Anſwered his Name <hi>Cephas,</hi> and Sunk like a Stone.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And immediately Jeſus ſtretched forth his hand, and caught him, and ſaid unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt? 32 And when they were come into the ſhip, the wind ceaſed. 33 Then they that were in the ſhip, came and worſhipped him, ſaying, Of a truth, thou art the Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The Mercy of Chriſt is no ſooner ſought but found: <hi>Immediately Jeſus put forth his Hand and caught him.</hi> Oh with what ſpeed, and with what Aſſurance ſhould we flee to that Soveraign Bounty, from whence never any Suitor was ſent away empty. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Though Chriſt gave <hi>Peter</hi> his Hand, yet with his Hand he gave him a Check: <hi>O thou of little Faith, why didſt thou doubt?</hi> Though Chriſt likes Believing, yet he diſlikes Doubting.

               <p n="1">1 THen came to Jeſus Scribes and Phariſees, which were of Jeruſalem, ſaying, 2 Why do thy diſciples tranſgreſs the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the elders? for they waſh not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
               <p>The former part of this Chapter acquaints us with a great Conteſt between our Saviour and the Phariſees about their Traditions and old Cuſtoms, which they valued more than the Commandments of God: They accuſed the Diſciples for Eating Bread with unwaſht Hands, which though it were in it ſelf but a Decent Cuſtom, the Phariſees made it a Religious Rite; for which reaſon, our Saviour and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would not obſerve it. <hi>Whence we learn,</hi> That what is in it ſelf, and may without offence be done as a Civil Cuſtom, ought to be diſcountenanced and oppoſed when Men require it of us as a Religious Act.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But he anſwered and ſaid unto them, Why do you alſo tranſgreſs the Commandment of God by your tradition? 4 For God commanded, ſaying, Honour thy father and mother: and, he that curſeth father or mother, let him die the death. 5 But ye ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his father or his mother, It is a gift by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou mighteſt be profited by me, 6 And honour not his father, or his mother, <hi>he ſhall be free.</hi> Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The heavy Charge which our Saviour brings in againſt the Phariſees; namely, For violating an Expreſs Command of God, and preferring their own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions before it: You make void <hi>the Comandments of God by your Traditions. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Command which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our inſtances in, as violated by them, it is the <hi>Fifth</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which requires Children to Relieve their Parents in their Neceſſity. Now though the Phariſees did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this in plain Terms, yet they made an Exception from it, which if Children had a mind, rendered it void and uſeleſs. For the Phariſees taught, that in caſe any would give a Gift to the Temple, which Gift they called <hi>Corban,</hi> and of which they themſelves had a great ſhare; that then Children were diſcharged from making any fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

It is more acceptable to God to refreſh the Bowels of his Saints, who are the Living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, than to adorn material Temples with Gold and Silver.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Ye hypocrites, well did Eſaias propheſie of you, ſaying, 8 This people draweth nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me with their mouth, and honoureth me me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. 9 But in vain they do worſhip me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of Men.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour reproves the Hypocritical Phariſees for theſe things, 1. That they preferred Humane Traditions before the Divine Precepts. 2. That by their Humane Traditions, they made void the Worſhip of God. It is God's undoubted Prerogative to preſcribe all the parts of his own Worſhip; and whoever preſumes to add thereunto, they worſhip him in vain. Our Saviour farther ſhews, that all this proceeded
<pb facs="tcp:46556:24"/> from the Inſincerity of their Hearts: <hi>This People honoureth me with their Lips, but their Heart is far from me.</hi> Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the removing of the Heart far from God in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> is a great <hi>Sin,</hi> and an high Degree of <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> 2. That whatever Outward <hi>Shew</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> Men make, if their <hi>Hearts</hi> be not right with God; and what they do, proceeds not from an Inward Principle of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, they are under the Reign and Power of <hi>Hypocriſie.

                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. How the <hi>Diſciples</hi> wonder, that our Saviour did ſo little regard the Diſpleaſure of the <hi>Phariſees; Knowest thou not, that the Phariſees were offended?</hi> Altho' nothing vext the <hi>Phariſees</hi> more, than the Diſcovery of their Falſe Doctrine before the Multitude, yet our Saviour did not ſtick to detect their Errours, and to declare the Truth; let the Effects of their Diſpleaſure be what they would. Sinful Man-pleaſing is fruitleſs and endleſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Our Lord's Anſwer; which ſhews a double Reaſon why he thus ſlighted the Offence taken by the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> 1. He compares the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Doctrine and Tradition to noiſom Weeds in the Church; planted there, not by God, but themſelves; and conſequently ſhall certainly be rooted up. In Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> if Men will act according to the Dictates of their own <hi>Fancies,</hi> and not walk by the Rule of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Word,</hi> they may pleaſe themſelves perhaps, but they can never pleaſe their Maker. Divine Inſtitution is the only ſure Rule of Religious Worſhip. 2. Chriſt compares the <hi>Phariſees</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to blind Guides. <hi>They are blind Leaders of the Blind:</hi> Leaders and Followers, both blind, who will certainly and ſuddenly <hi>fall into the Ditch</hi> of Temporal and Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Ignorant, Erroneous, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Miniſters, are the heavieſt Judgments that can befal a People. 2. That the following of ſuch Teachers and blind Guides, will be no Excuſe to a People another Day; much leſs free them from the Danger of Eternal Deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Then anſwered Peter, and ſaid unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 16 And Jeſus ſaid, Are ye alſo yet without underſtanding? 17 Do not ye yet underſtand, that whatſoever entreth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is caſt out into the draught? 18 But thoſe things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſs, blaſphemies. 20 Theſe are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwaſhen hands, defileth not a man.</p>
               <p>The Diſciples deſiring the Interpretation of the foregoing Parable, our Saviour gives it them; but withal expoſtulates with them, that they did not underſtand a thing ſo obvious and plain; <hi>Are ye yet without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Have you ſat thus long under my Miniſterial Teaching, and enjoyed the Benefit of my Company and Converſation, And yet are no farther <hi>Proficients</hi> in <hi>Knowledge?</hi> Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That our Lord expects a <hi>Proficiency</hi> in <hi>Knowledge</hi> from us, anſwerable to the <hi>Opportunities</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> enjoyed by us. Next, he gives them the Sence and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Parable; telling them, that it is out of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart, that all Sin proceeds: The Heart is the Cage of Neſt which is full of theſe unclean Birds, and from whence they take their flight. Tho' the <hi>Occaſions</hi> of Sin are from without, yet the <hi>Source</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of Sin is from within. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Heart of Man is the Sink and Seed-Plot of all Sin, and the Fountain of all Pollution; the Life could not be ſo bad, if the Heart were not worſe: All the Irregularity of our <hi>Lives,</hi> flows from the Impurity of our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Natures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 And Jeſus went thence, and departed into the coaſts of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And behold a woman of Canaan came out of the ſame coaſts, and cried unto him, ſaying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David, my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The conſtant Employment of our Saviour, <hi>He went about doing Good,</hi> from Place to Place; in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> he finds a Faithful Woman of the Race of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who becomes an humble Supplicant to Chriſt, while the <hi>Jews</hi> neglected ſo great Salvation. Yea, ſhe not only ſpeaks, but cries unto him. Were we duly affected with our Spiritual Wants, we could ſpeak to God in no other Language, than that of Cries and Tears; nothing but Cries can pierce Heaven. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Tho' all <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not Example the Faith of this <hi>Canaanite,</hi> yet was her Daughter tormented with a Devil. <hi>Learn,</hi> That neither Truth, nor Strength of Faith, can ſecure us either againſt Satan's inward <hi>Temptations,</hi> or outward <hi>Vexations;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the worſt of <hi>Bodily Afflictions</hi> are no ſufficient Proof of Divine Diſpleaſure. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Daughter did not come to Chriſt for her ſelf, but the Mother for her. Perhaps the Child was not ſo ſenſible of its own Miſery, but the good Mother feels both the Child's Sorrow and her own. True Goodneſs teaches us to appropriate the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of others to our ſelves; it cauſes us to bear their <hi>Griefs,</hi> and to ſympathize with them in their <hi>Sorrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 But he anſwered her not a word. And his diſciples came and beſought him, ſaying, Send her away, for ſhe crieth after us.</p>
               <p>Strange! That a miſerable Supplicant ſhould cry and ſue, whilſt the God of Mercy is ſpeechleſs. What? Is the Fountain of Mercy dried up? Oh Saviour! We have oft ſound Cauſe to wonder at thy <hi>Words,</hi> but never till now at thy <hi>Silence. Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt doth ſometimes delay to return an Anſwer to a well-qualified Prayer. Sometimes his People do not Pray enough earneſtly; ſometimes they Pray too earneſtly, for ſome Outward and Temporal Mercy; ſometimes the Mercy they Pray for is not good for them; or it may be, it is not yet good for them. Let us not then judge of God's Hearing Prayer, by his preſent Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="24">24 But he anſwered and ſaid, I am not ſent, but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> When our Saviour doth Anſwer, he gives not one Word of Comfort, but rather a Repulſe. Chriſt has oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Love in his Heart to his People, when they can read none in his Countenance, nor gather it from his Diſcourſe. <hi>Obſ.</hi> The Anſwer it ſelf. Chriſt ſays not, <hi>I am ſent to the lost Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Adam; but, <hi>To the lost Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. The <hi>Jews</hi> are compared unto <hi>Sheep,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto <hi>Dogs.</hi> Chriſt inſinuates, that tho' ſhe were a loſt Sheep of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet not being one of the loſt Sheep of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he could do nothing for her.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Then came ſhe and worſhipped him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord, help me.</p>
               <p>Yet hath not this poor Woman done; Chriſt's former Silence, and his preſent Denial, cannot ſilence her: She
<pb facs="tcp:46556:25"/> 
                  <hi>Comes,</hi> ſhe <hi>Worſhips,</hi> ſhe <hi>Cries, Lord, help me.</hi> Oh what an undaunted Grace is the Grace of Faith! It has a ſtrong Heart, and a bold Forehead, peremptory Denials cannot diſmay it. This <hi>Woman</hi> will not deſpond, though her Prayer of Faith, from the Knees of Humility, ſucceed not.</p>
               <p n="26">26 But he anſwered and ſaid, It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it to dogs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> The ſeeming Severity of Chriſt to this poor Woman; he calls her not a <hi>Woman,</hi> but a <hi>Dog;</hi> and as it were ſpurns her from his Feet, with an harſh Repulſe. Did ever ſo ſevere a Word drop from thoſe mild Lips? What ſhall we ſay? Is the Lamb of God turn'd Lion? That a Woman in <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> imploring Pity, yea, a <hi>good Woman,</hi> and an humble Suppliant, ſhould be thus rated out of Chriſt's Preſence for a <hi>Dog. Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt puts the ſtrongeſt Faith of his own Children upon the ſevereſt Trials: The Trial had never been ſo ſharp, if her Faith had not been ſo ſtrong. Uſually, where God gives much Grace, he tries Grace much.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And ſhe ſaith, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their maſter's table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> how her Humility grants all, her Patience over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all, ſhe meekly deſires to poſſeſs the Dog's place; not to crowd <hi>to</hi> the Table, but to creep <hi>under it,</hi> and to partake of the Crumbs of Mercy that fall from thence. Indeed ſhe ſhewed one of the beſt Qualities of a Dog, in keeping her Hold where ſhe had once faſtned; not letting go, or giving over, until ſhe had gotten what ſhe deſired. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That nothing is ſo pleaſing unto Chriſt, as to ſee his People following him with Faith and Importunity, when he ſeems to withdraw from them.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Then Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee, even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diſciples</hi> obſerving her Behaviour, might have been ready to ſay; O Woman, great is thy Patience, great is thy Humility: But ſays Chriſt, <hi>Great is thy FAITH;</hi> he ſees the <hi>Root,</hi> we the <hi>Branches.</hi> Nothing but Faith could thus temper the Heart, thus ſtrengthen the Soul, thus charm the Tongue. Oh powerful Grace of Faith, which Chriſt himſelf could no longer withſtand, but cries out as a Perſon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the prevalency of it; <hi>Oh Woman, great is thy Faith. Note,</hi> That no Grace ever goes away from Chriſt uncrowned: Tho' we may wait long for a Mercy, yet the Hand of Faith never knockt in vain at the Door of Heaven. Mercy is as ſurely ours, as if we had it, if we have but Faith and Patience to wait for it. This good Woman found it ſo, to her unſpeakable Comfort: And the ſame ſhall we find, in the Exerciſe of the ſame Grace.</p>
               <p n="29">29 And Jeſus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the ſea of Galilee, and went up into a mountain, and ſat down there. 30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them thoſe that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and caſt them down at Jeſus feet, and he healed them: 31 Inſomuch that the multitude wondred, when they ſaw the dumb to ſpeak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to ſee: and they glorified the God of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The Charity. 2. The Faith of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; in bringing the Blind, the Deaf, and the Dumb to Chriſt: Their Charity, in lending Eyes to the Blind, and a Tongue to the Dumb; who could neither come to Chriſt themſelves, nor ſpeak for themſelves. Every Man has a Tongue to Speak for himſelf, happy is he that has a Tongue to Pray and Intercede for others: This Charity did the People exerciſe here. <hi>Obſerve alſo,</hi> Their Faith; they laid the Lame and the Blind down at Jeſus Feet, relying upon his Power, and believing his Willingneſs to Help and Heal them. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The Effect of this Miracle upon the Multitude, it was Twofold. 1. They were ſtruck with <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Wonder,</hi> to ſee ſuch <hi>Cures</hi> wrought as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Courſe of Nature, and the Power of Art. 2. <hi>They glorified the God of</hi> Iſrael. That is, they acknowledged it to be a wonderful Work of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> wrought by that God whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> worſhipt. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That the <hi>Miraculous Works</hi> of Chriſt which he wrought before the Multitude, were obvious to their Senſes; and did conſtrain the Beholders (if not blinded with <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Obſtinacy) to acknowledge the Power of God communicated to Chriſt, and to praiſe him for it: <hi>The Multitude marvelled, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32 Then Jeſus called his diſciples unto him, and ſaid, I have compaſſion on the multitude, becauſe they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not ſend them away faſting, leſt they faint in the way. 33 And his diſciples ſay unto him, Whence ſhould we have ſo much bread in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to fill ſo great a multitude? 34 And Jeſus ſaith unto them, How many loaves have ye? and they ſaid, Seven, and a few little fiſhes. 35 And he commanded the multitude to ſit down on the ground. 36 And he took the ſeven loaves, and the fiſhes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his diſciples, and the diſciples to the multitude.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Second <hi>Miracle</hi> of Chriſt's compaſſionate Feeding the Hungry Multitude. <hi>Chap.</hi> XIV. we read of 5000 fed <hi>with five Loaves and two Fiſhes;</hi> here Chriſt feeds 4000 <hi>with ſeven Loaves, and a few ſmall Fiſhes.</hi> Where <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> That Chriſt fed feweſt, when he had moſt Proviſion; when he had <hi>Seven Loaves,</hi> he fed but 4000; when he had but <hi>five Loaves,</hi> he fed 5000. Thus the Wiſdom and Power of Chriſt is glorified by him, as he pleaſes. The feeding of <hi>one Thouſand</hi> with <hi>one Loaf,</hi> was as true a Miracle as the feeding <hi>ſeven Thouſand.</hi> Our Saviour did put forth the Power of his Godhead in working <hi>Miracles,</hi> after what manner ſeemed beſt to his own Wiſdom. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> A double Action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our Saviour. 1. <hi>He gave Thanks;</hi> that is, he prayd for a Bleſſing upon the <hi>Food: Teaching</hi> us our Duty, That if the Son of God did look up to Heaven, and <hi>Bleſs</hi> his <hi>Food,</hi> we ſhould not ſit down to our <hi>Food,</hi> as a Beaſt to his <hi>Fodder,</hi> without craving a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon it. The next Action was, <hi>He gave to his Diſciples.</hi> But why did he diſtribute the <hi>Loaves</hi> by the Hand of his <hi>Diſciples? Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Diſciples</hi> queſtioned thro' the weakneſs of their Faith, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a Multitude as 4000 could be fed with ſo ſmall a Proviſion as <hi>ſeven Loaves.</hi> Now our Saviour to convince them how eaſily he could do that thing which they adjudged impoſſible, he diſtributes the Bread <hi>by them;</hi> making uſe of their own <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> for their <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Thus Chriſt to ſhame the Unbelief of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> makes them not only <hi>Spectators,</hi> but <hi>Actors</hi> in that <hi>Work</hi> which they judged impoſſible to be effected.</p>
               <p n="37">37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left, ſeven baskets full. 38 And they that did eat were four thouſand men, beſide women and children. 39 And he ſent away the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and took ſhip, and came into the coaſts of Magdala.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They did all eat,</hi> not a Crumb or a Bit, but to <hi>Fulneſs</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> yet <hi>Seven Baskets</hi> remain; anſwering the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Loaves,</hi> as the <hi>Twelve Baskets</hi> in the former Miracle anſwered the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles:</hi> In both, more is left than was at firſt ſet on: It is hard to ſay, which was the greater Miracle, the <hi>Miraculous Eating,</hi> or <hi>Miraculous Leaving.</hi> If we conſider what they eat, we may juſtly wonder that they left any thing: If what they left, that they eat any thing. <hi>Obſerve laſtly,</hi> Chriſt would not have theſe <hi>Fragments</hi> loſt, but gathered up; the Great Houſe-keeper of the World will not allow the <hi>Loſs</hi> of his <hi>Orts.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:25"/> Oh how dreadful will the Account of thoſe be, who have large and plentiful Eſtates to Anſwer for, as Loſt, being ſpent upon their <hi>Luſts,</hi> in <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Exceſs!</hi>

               <p n="1">1 THE Phariſees alſo with the Sadduces came, and tempting, deſired him that he would ſhew them a ſign from heaven. 2 He anſwered and ſaid unto them, When it is evening, ye ſay, <hi>It will be</hi> fair weather: for the sky is red. 3 And in the morning, <hi>It will be</hi> foul weather to day, for the sky is red and lowring.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The <hi>Perſons</hi> demanding of our Saviour a Sign, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Perſons of contrary <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Intereſts;</hi> yet both agree in Tempting and Oppoſing Chriſt. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Wicked Men, how oppoſite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are one to another, yet can agree together in Oppoſing Chriſt, and Undermining his Truth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Sign demanded, <hi>Shew us a Sign from Heaven:</hi> As if they had ſaid, Put us not off with ſuch <hi>Earthly Signs</hi> as we have ſeen, in multiplying <hi>Loaves;</hi> but let us ſee a Miracle from <hi>Heaven;</hi> ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> wrought. This they deſired, not ſo much for their <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> as out of <hi>Curioſity,</hi> nay, <hi>Wicked Treachery.

Our Saviour's Rejection of this Demand of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to give them a Sign; <hi>Oh ye Hypocrites,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye can diſcern the Face of the Sky, but ye cannot diſcern the Signs of the Times.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Did not Malice and Obſtinacy blind your Eyes, ye might as eaſily ſee and diſcern, that theſe are the Times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that I am he, by the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by me; as you can make a Judgment of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by looking upon the Sky. <hi>Learn,</hi> That to pretend more Ignorance or Uncertainty in diſcerning the Signs of <hi>Goſpel-Times,</hi> than the Signs of the <hi>Weather,</hi> is great Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie: <hi>Ye Hypocrites, ye can diſcern the Face of the Sky, but can ye not diſcern the Signs of the Times?

All that our Saviour blames was, that they were better skill'd in the Signs of the <hi>Weather,</hi> than in the Signs of the <hi>Times.</hi> As God by Natural Signs gives us Warning of a Change in Natural Things; ſo by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Diſpenſations he gives us Warning of a Change in Civil Things: <hi>He that is Wiſe, will Obſerve theſe Things;</hi> and by their Obſervation, <hi>Will come to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand the Pleaſure of the Lord.</hi>

               <p n="5">5 And when his diſciples were come to the other ſide, they had forgotten to take bread. 6 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Take heed, and be ware of the leaven of the Phariſees, and of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. 7 And they reaſoned among themſelves, ſaying, <hi>It is</hi> becauſe we have taken no bread. 8 Which when Jeſus perceived, he ſaid unto them; O ye of little faith, why reaſon ye among your ſelves, becauſe ye have brought no bread? 9 Do ye not yet underſtand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thouſand, and how many baskets ye took up? 10 Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſeven loaves of the four thouſand, and how many baskets ye took up? 11 How is it that ye do not underſtand, that I ſpake it not to you concerning bread, that ye ſhould beware of the leaven of the Phariſees, and of the Sadduces? 12 Then underſtood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread; but of the doctrine of the Phariſees, and of the Sadduces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How dull the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt were under Chriſt's own Teaching, and how apt to put a Carnal Sence upon his <hi>Words;</hi> they apprehended he had ſpoken to them of the Leaven of Bread, what he intended of the Leaven of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Doctrine. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The ſmart and ſharp <hi>Reproof</hi> which Chriſt gave his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> for not underſtanding the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Signification</hi> of what he ſpake. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is much diſpleaſed with his own People, when he diſcerns <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> in them, after more than ordinary Means of Knowledge enjoyed by them. <hi>How is it, that ye do not yet underſtand? Obſ.</hi> 3. The <hi>Metaphor</hi> which Chriſt ſets forth the corrupt Doctrine of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> by; he compares it to <hi>Leaven,</hi> partly for its <hi>Sowrneſs,</hi> and partly for its <hi>Diffuſiveneſs.</hi> Leaven is a piece of ſower Dough, that diffuſes it ſelf into the whole Maſs or Lump of Bread with which it is mixed. From whence our Saviour intimates, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were a ſower and proud ſort of People; and their Doctrines, like themſelves, poiſonable and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their Conſequences; the <hi>Contagion</hi> of which our Lord warns his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to avoid and ſhun. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That Error is as damnable as Vice; Perſons Erroneous in their Judgments are to be avoided, as well as thoſe that are Lewd and Wicked in their Converſations. He that has a due Care of his Soul's Salvation, muſt as well beware of Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous <hi>Principles,</hi> as of Debauched <hi>Practices. Obſ.</hi> 4. Our Saviour does not command his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to ſeparate from <hi>Commmunion</hi> with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and oblige them not hear their <hi>Doctrine;</hi> but only to beware of the <hi>Errors</hi> that they mix with their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> We may, and ought to hold <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with a Church, tho' Erroneous in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> if not Fundamentally Erroneous. <hi>Separation</hi> from a Church, is not juſtifiable upon any other Ground, than that which makes a <hi>Separation</hi> betwixt God and that Church: Which is either the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of that Church into groſs <hi>Idolatry;</hi> or in Point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> into damnable <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13 When Jeſus came into the coaſts of Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea Philippi, he asked his diſciples, ſaying, Whom do men ſay that I the Son of man am? 14 And they ſaid, Some <hi>ſay that thou art</hi> John the Baptiſt, ſome Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 15 He ſaith unto them, But whom ſay ye that I am? 16 And Simon Peter anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God. 17 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> Our Saviour's Queſtion, and the Diſciples Anſwer. Our Saviour's Queſtion is twofold: 1. <hi>Whom do Men ſay that I am?</hi> Not that the Son of God was ignorant what Men ſaid of him; but he had an Intention more firmly to ſettle and eſtabliſh his Diſciples in the Belief of his being the promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And therefore, 2. He puts the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to them, <hi>Whom do you my Diſciples ſay that I am?</hi> You, that have heard the Holineſs of my <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and ſeen the Divinity of my <hi>Miracles.</hi> What ſay you to me? And what <hi>Confeſſion</hi> do you make of me? Chriſt expects greater Meaſures of Grace and Knowledge, and higher Degrees of Affiance and Faith, from thoſe that have enjoyed the greateſt Means of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> The Diſciples were Eye and Ear-Witneſſes of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he expects from them a full <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

'Tis no new thing (it ſeems) to find Diverſity of Judgments and Opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, and the Affairs of his Kingdom. We find, that when our Saviour was amongſt Men, who daily both ſaw and heard him, yet there was then a Diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning him. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Name of the reſt,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:26"/> and as the Mouth of all the Apoſtles, makes a full and open Confeſſion of his Deity; <hi>Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.</hi> Whence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Vail of Chriſt's Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not keep the Eye of his Diſciples Faith from ſeeing him to be One in Subſtance with the Father: <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God. Obſerve,</hi> 3. How highly pleaſed our Saviour was with this Confeſſion; he pronounces <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt in him, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> who had by him made this Chriſtian Confeſſion; <hi>Bleſſed art thou, Simon;</hi> and tells him, 1. What did not enable him to make that Confeſſion, <hi>Not Fleſh and Blood;</hi> that is, not Man, nor the Wiſdom and Reaſon of Man. 2. But poſitively, <hi>God the Father,</hi> by the Operation of his Spirit, and the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, has wrought this Divine Faith in you, and drawn forth this Glorious Confeſſion from you, that I am indeed the Son of God. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That no Man can ſavingly believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Eternal Son of God, and Saviour of the World; but he, in whom God himſelf by his Holy Spirit has wrought ſuch a Perſwaſion by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>

The Perſon to whom this Promiſe is made; namely, to <hi>Peter</hi> with the reſt of the Apoſtles; the Confeſſion being made by him, in the Name of the reſt. Elſewhere we find the ſame Authority and Power given to them all, which is here committed unto <hi>Peter. Joh.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſe Sins ſoever ye remit, they are remitted.</hi> Altho' there might be a Priority of Order amongſt the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet no Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Power was founded in any one of them, over and above the reſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. the Power promiſed; I <hi>will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, the Key of Doctrine, and the Key of Diſcipline, or full Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Preach the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to Adminiſter <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and Execute <hi>Church-Cenſures.</hi> The Speech is Metaphorical, and alludes to <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in great Houſes, to whoſe Truſt the Keys of the Houſhold are committed. Chriſt's <hi>Miniſters</hi> are the <hi>Stewards</hi> of his Houſe, into whoſe Hands the <hi>Keys</hi> of his Church are committed by Chriſt. The Pope would ſnatch them out of all Hands, and keep them in his own; he ſnatches at <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys, but makes ſhipwrack of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith; arrogating <hi>Peter</hi>'s Power, but abrogating his Holy Profeſſion. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Authority and Power which the Miniſters of the Goſpel do exerciſe and execute, is from Chriſt. <hi>I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom.</hi> 2. That this Power of the Keys, Chriſt diſpenſed promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly to all his Apoſtles, and never deſigned it as a Peculiar for St. <hi>Peter:</hi> As they all made the ſame Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith by <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo they all received the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power with <hi>Peter.</hi>

               <p n="20">20 Then charged he his diſciples, that they ſhould tell no man, that he was Jeſus the Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, that our Saviour ſhould charge his Diſciples, to tell no Man that he was Jeſus the Chriſt, ſeeing the Knowledge of it was ſo neceſſary. The Reaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be, 1. Becauſe the Glory of his Godhead was not to be fully manifeſted till after his Reſurrection, and then to be publiſhed by himſelf, and confirmed by his own <hi>Miracles.</hi> 2. Leſt the Knowledge of it ſhould have hindred his Death: For, <hi>Had the Rulers known, they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory. Learn,</hi> That Chriſt has his own fit Times, and proper Seaſons, in which he reveals his own Myſteries to the World. 2. That Chriſt was ſo intent upon laying down his Life for Sinners, that he would not have his Death hindred by an untimely Declaration of his being truly and really God: After his Death it was, that <hi>He declared himſelf to be the Son of God with Power, by the Reſurrection from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="21">21 From that time forth began Jeſus to ſhew unto his diſciples, how that he muſt go unto Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the elders, and chief prieſts, and ſcribes, and be killed, and be raiſed again the third day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Wiſdom of our Saviour, in acquainting his Diſciples with the near Approach of his Death and Sufferings. This he did for ſeveral Reaſons: 1. To let them underſtand that he was really God, (as they had juſt before confeſs'd him to be) by his foreknowing and foretelling things to come. 2. To convince them of their Error, in apprehending that his Kingdom was of this World, and that he was to Reign here as a Temporal Prince. 3. To prevent their being offended at his Sufferings, and to prepare them for their own; that they might neither ſhrink at them, nor ſink under them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Perſons foretold by Chriſt, that ſhould be the bloody Actors in the Tragedy of his Death; namely, the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Chief Prieſts:</hi> It was the Poor that received Chriſt, and embraced the Goſpel; it was the Great Ones of the World that rejected him, and ſet him at nought; and the Rulers both in Church and State, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and crucifi'd him.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Then Peter took him, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this ſhall not be unto thee.</p>
               <p>No doubt <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake all this out of a ſincere intention, and with a ſingular Affection towards our Saviour; but Pious Intentions, and Good Affections, will not juſtifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Actions. From this Counſel of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt we <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. How ready Fleſh and Blood is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all that tends to Suffering: <hi>Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf.</hi> 2. What need we have to be fortified againſt the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Friends as well as of Enemies; for Satan can make good Men his inſtruments to do his Work, when they little think of it. <hi>Peter</hi> little ſuſpected that Satan ſet him on work to hinder the Redemption of Mankind by diſſwading Chriſt from Dying. But obſerve in the next Verſe with what indignation Chriſt rejects <hi>Peter</hi>'s Advice.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But he turned, and ſaid unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: for thou ſavoureſt not the things that <hi>be</hi> of God, but thoſe that <hi>be</hi> of Men.</p>
               <p>Chriſt lookt upon <hi>Peter</hi> with Anger and Diſpleaſure; Chriſt heard Satan ſpeaking in <hi>Peter.</hi> 'Twas <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tongue,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:26"/> but Satan tuned it; therefore Chriſt calls <hi>Peter</hi> by Satan's Name: They that will do the Devil's Work, ſhall have the Devil's Name too. He that would hinder the Redemption of Mankind, is Satan, an Adverſary to Mankind. From our Saviour's ſmart Reproof given to <hi>Peter, Learn,</hi> That no Love or Reſpect to Mens Perſons or Piety, muſt draw us to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them in their Sins, or cauſe us to ſpeak lightly of their Sins. From our Saviour's Reſolution not to favour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, notwithſtanding <hi>Peter</hi>'s Advice, <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſo intent was the Heart of Chriſt, upon the great Work of Man's Redemption, that he could not bear the leaſt word that ſhould obſtruct him in it, or divert him from it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How our Saviour recommends his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to every Man's Choice; not attempting by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to compel any to the Profeſſion of it. <hi>If any Man will come after me,</hi> that is, If any Man chooſe and reſolve to be a Chriſtian. 2. Our Saviour's Terms propounded. 1. Self-denial, <hi>Let him deny himſelf.</hi> By which we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Denying and Renouncing of our Senſes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, nor yet the Renouncing of our Reaſon in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; but by <hi>Self-denial</hi> is meant, that we ſhould be willing to part with all our Earthly Comforts, and quit all our Temporal Enjoyments for the ſake of Chriſt and his Holy Religion. 2. Goſpel-Suffering, <hi>He muſt take up his Croſs:</hi> An Alluſion to a Roman Cuſtom, that the Malefactor who was to be Crucified, took his Croſs upon his Shoulder, and carried it to the place of Execution. <hi>Where Note,</hi> Not the making of the Croſs for our ſelves, but the patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it when God lays it upon our Shoulder, is the Duty injoyned: <hi>Let him take up his Croſs.</hi> 3. Goſpel-Service, <hi>He must follow me,</hi> that is, Obey my Commands, and follow my Example: He muſt ſet my Life and Doctrine continually before him, and muſt be daily Correcting and Reforming of his Life by that Rule and Pattern.</p>
               <p n="25">25 For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That the Love of this Temporal Life, is a great Temptation to Men to deny Chriſt, and to Renounce his Holy Religion. 2. That the ſureſt way to attain Eternal Life is Chearfully to lay down a Mortal Life, when the Glory of Chriſt and his Service calleth us thereunto.</p>
               <p n="26">26 For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That God has intruſted every one of us with a Soul of ineſtimable worth and preciouſneſs, capable of being ſaved or loſt, and that to all Eternity. 2. That the Gain of the whole World is not comparable with the Loſs of one precious Soul. The Soul's Loſs is an incompenſable and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Loſs.</p>

               <p>The former part of this Chapter gives us an Account of our Saviour's Glorious Transfiguration: He laid as it were the Garments of frail Humanity and Mortality aſide for a little time, and aſſuming to himſelf the Robes of Majeſty and Glory, the Rays of his Divinity darted forth, his Face ſhined with a pleaſing Brightneſs, and his Raiment with ſuch a Glorious Luſtre, as did at once both Dazle and Delight the Eyes of the Beholders. <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Reaſons of our Lord's Transfiguration, 1. To Demonſtrate and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Truth of his Divinity, That <hi>he was Chriſt the Son of the Living God.</hi> According to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Confeſſion juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This Divine Glory was an Evidence of his Divine Nature. 2. Chriſt was thus transfigured to prefigure the Glory of his Second Coming to Judgment, <hi>when he ſhall be admired of his Saints,</hi> as here he was admired by his Diſciples. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Choice which our Saviour makes of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Transfiguration, his Three Diſciples, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> But why Diſciples? Why Three Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? Why theſe Three? 1. This Transfiguration was a Type and Shadow of the Glory of Heaven: Chriſt therefore vouchſafes the Earneſt and firſt Fruits of that Glory only to Saints; upon whom he intended to beſtow the full Harveſt, 2. Three Diſciples were Witneſſes ſufficient to Teſtifie this Miracle: <hi>Judas</hi> was unworthy of this Favour; yet leſt he ſhould murmur, or be diſcontented at his being left out, others are alſo left out beſides him. 3. Theſe Three, rather than others; becauſe, 1. Theſe Diſciples were more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Grace, Zeal and Love to Chriſt; and conſequently, are moſt highly dignified and honoured by him. The moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Manifeſtations of Glory are made by God to thoſe that are moſt eminent in Grace. 2. Theſe Three were Witneſſes of Chriſt's Agony and Paſſion; to prepare them for which, they are here made Witneſſes of his Transfiguration. This glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Viſion upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> fitted them to abide the Terrors of Mount <hi>Calvary.

<pb facs="tcp:46556:27"/> concerned in what was done, they were not only Spectators, but Partners. Man's Reſtauration was Chriſt's principal Aim, the Angels Confirmation his leſs principal Deſign. But why <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> the Giver of the Law, and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the Chief of the Prophets, attending both upon Chriſt, did ſhew the Conſent of the Law and the Prophets with Chriſt, and their Fulfilling and Accompliſhment in him. 2. Becauſe theſe two were the moſt laborious Servants of Chriſt. Both adventured their Lives in God's Cauſe, and therefore are highly honoured by Chriſt. <hi>Such as honour him, he will honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Then anſwered Peter and ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moſes, and one for Elias.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Perſon ſupplicating, <hi>Peter.</hi> No doubt the other two, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were much affected, but <hi>Peter</hi> is moſt ſervent and forward, yet there is no arguing with the Papiſts from his Fervency, to his Superiority, his Perſonal Prerogatives were not hereditary. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2.

The Supplication it ſelf, and that was for their Continuance where they were. <hi>It is good for us to be here.</hi> Oh what a raviſhing Comfort is the Fellowſhip of the Saints, but the Preſence of Chriſt among them, renders their Joys tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Their Proffer of Service to farther this Continuance; <hi>Let us make Three Tabernacles.</hi> This Motion was well meant and devout. St. <hi>Peter</hi> will ſtick at no Coſt or Pains for the Enjoyment of Chriſt's Preſence, and his Saints Company, yet was the Motion unadviſed and raſh. St. <hi>Peter</hi> errs, in deſiring a Perpetuity of that Condition, which was but tranſient and momentary. This Viſion was only a Taſte of Glory, not a full Repaſt. He errs, in that he would bring down Heaven to Earth, and take up with <hi>Tabor,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Heaven.</hi> He errs, in that he would enter upon the Poſſeſſion of Heavens Glory, without ſuffering, and without dying. Peter <hi>would be clothed upon, but was not willing to be uncloathed. Learn,</hi> 1. That a Glimpſe of Glory is enough to wrap a Soul into Extaſie, and to make it out of Love with Worldly Company. 2. That we are apt to deſire more of Heaven upon Earth, than God will allow: We would fain have the Heavenly Glory come down to us, but we are unwilling to go by Death to that; we know not what we ſay when we talk of Felicity, in Tabernacles upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 While he yet ſpake, behold, a bright cloud overſhadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, which ſaid, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed: hear ye him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A Cloud was put before the Diſciples Eyes, for two Reaſons. 1. To allay the Luſtre and Reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of that Glory which they were ſwallowed up with. As we cannot look upon the Sun in its full Brightneſs, but under a Cloud by Reflexion: So the Glory of Heaven is inſupportable, till God vails it, and ſhelters us from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it. 2. A Cloud overſhadows them, to hinder their farther prying and looking into the Glory. We muſt be content to behold God here through a Cloud <hi>darkly, e'er long we ſhall ſee him Face to Face. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Teſtimony given by God the Father out of the Cloud concerning Jeſus Chriſt his Son: <hi>This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Here <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The Dignity of his Perſon, he is a <hi>Son,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for Nature coeſſential, for Dignity coequal, for Time coeternal with the Father; and a <hi>Beloved Son,</hi> becauſe of his Likeneſs and Conformity to him. Father's Likeneſs is the cauſe of Love, and a Union of Wills cauſes a mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing of Affections. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The Excellency of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. <hi>In whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Chriſt in himſelf was moſt pleaſing to God the Father, and in and through him he is well pleaſed with all Believers. Chriſt's Mediation for us makes God appeaſeable to us. <hi>Note</hi> 3. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Doctrine. <hi>Hear him,</hi> Not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who were Servants, but Chriſt my Son, whom I have commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be the great Prophet and Teacher of my Church: Therefore adore him, as my Son, believe in him, as your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and hear him as your Lawgiver. He honours Chriſt moſt that obeys him beſt. The obedient Ear honours Chriſt more than either the gazing Eye, the adoring Knee, or the applauding Tongue. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi>

               <p n="6">6 And when the diſciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were ſore afraid. 7 And Jeſus came, and touched them, and ſaid, Ariſe, and be not afraid. 8 And when they had lift up their eyes, they ſaw no man, ſave Jeſus only. 9 And as they came down from the mountain Jeſus charged them, ſaying, Tell the viſion to no man, until the Son of man be riſen again from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Effect which this Voice from Heaven had upon the Apoſtles, it caſt them into a Paſſion of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Amazement. <hi>They were ſore afraid, and fell on their Face. Learn thence,</hi> That ſuch is the Majeſty and Glory of God, that Man in his ſinful State cannot bear ſo much as a Glimpſe of it, without great Conſternation and Fear. How unable is Man to hear the Voice of God? And yet how ready to deſpiſe the Voice of Man? If God ſpeaks by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Voice is too terrible; if he ſpeaks by his Miniſters, ir is too contemptible. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Perſon by whom the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were recovered out of theſe amazing Fears, into which they were caſt, namely, by Chriſt. <hi>Jeſus came, and ſaid, be not afraid. Learn,</hi> That it is Chriſt alone, who can raiſe and comfort thoſe whom the Terrors of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have dejected and caſt down. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The manner how Chriſt recovered them out of this paſſionate Amazement, it was threefold; 1. By his Gracious Approach, <hi>he came unto them.</hi> Chriſt will come with Comfort unto his Children, when they are diſabled from coming to him for Comfort. 2. By his comfortable Touch; <hi>He came and touched them.</hi> Chriſt comforts Believers by a real and cloſe Application of himſelf unto them. An unapplied Chriſt ſaves none, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts none. 3. By his comforting Voice, <hi>He ſaid, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</hi> 'Tis a Word of Aſſurance, that there is no Ground nor Cauſe of Fear, and 'tis a Word of Aſſiſtance. 'Tis <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Operatorium,</hi> he that ſaid unto them, <hi>Ariſe, be not afraid,</hi> did by his Spirit breath Life, and conveigh Strength into their Souls to enable them to ariſe. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The ſtrict Injunction given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, not to publiſh or proclaim this Viſion till after his Reſurrection, for two Reaſons; 1. Leſt it ſhould hinder his Paſſion: For had the <hi>Rulers of the World known him to be the Lord of Life and Glory, they would not have crucified him:</hi> Therefore Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely concealed his Deity, to give way to his Paſſion. 2. Chriſt being now in a State of Humiliation would have his Majeſty veiled, his Glory concealed, and conſequently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that the Glorious Viſion of his Transfiguration ſhould be publiſhed, and accordingly charges his Diſciples, <hi>That they tell the Viſion to no Man till he was riſen.</hi>

               <p n="10">10 And his diſciples asked him, ſaying, Why then ſay the ſcribes, that Elias muſt firſt come? 11 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Elias truly ſhall firſt come, and reſtore all things: 12 But I ſay unto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatſoever they liſted: likewiſe ſhall alſo the Son of man ſuffer of them. 13 Then the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples underſtood that he ſpake unto them of John the Baptiſt.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Diſciples Queſtion, and our Saviour's Anſwer. They ask our Saviour how the Obſervation of the Jewiſh Doctors holds good, that <hi>Elias</hi> muſt come before the Meſſias come? We ſee the Meſſias, but we ſee no <hi>Elias;</hi> our Saviour anſwers, that <hi>Elias</hi> was come already. Not <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> in Perſon, but one <hi>in the Spirit and Power of</hi> Elias. One of his Spirit and Temper, to wit, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who was propheſied of under the Name of <hi>Elias.</hi> And indeed great was the Reſemblance between the <hi>Elias</hi> of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the New; <hi>viz. John the Baptiſt.</hi> They were both born in bad Times, they were both Zealous for God and Religion; they were both undaunted Reprovers of the Faults of Princes, and they were both hated, and implacably
<pb facs="tcp:46556:27"/> perſecuted for the ſame. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Hatred and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even unto Death, has often been the Lot and Portion of ſuch as have had the Courage and Zeal to improve the Faults of Princes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A ſick Patient brought to Chriſt the great Phyſician for Cure and Healing. A <hi>Lunatick,</hi> that is, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at certain times of the Moon, afflicted with the Falling Sickneſs. 2. This Sickneſs of his was aggravated by Satan, who bodily poſſeſs'd him, and cruelly caſt him into the Fire, and into the Water, but rather for Torture than Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch: Oh how does Satan, that malicious Tyrant, rejoice in doing Hurt to Mankind.

The Phyſicians that he was brought unto. <hi>Firſt, To the Diſciples;</hi> and when they could not cure him, then to <hi>Jeſus.</hi> We never apply our ſelves importunately to the God of Power, till we totally deſpair of the Creatures help.</p>

               <p>Theſe Words are a ſevere Rebuke, given by Chriſt to his own Diſciples. Where, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> the Perſons upbraided; his Diſciples and the Sin upbraided with Unbelief. <hi>Oh faithleſs Generation!</hi> Yet was it not the total Want of Faith, but the Weakneſs and Imperfection of Faith, that they were upbraided with, and reproved for. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Unbelief may lye hid and undiſcerned in a Perſon's Heart, which neither others nor himſelf may take any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, until ſome Tryal doth diſcover it. The Diſciples were not ſenſible of that Unbelief, which lay hid in them, till this Occaſion did diſcover it. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the great Obſtacle and Obſtruction of all Bleſſings, both Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal coming to us, is our Unbelief. <hi>Oh faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Generation.</hi>

               <p n="19">19 Then came the diſciples to Jeſus apart, and ſaid, Why could not we caſt him out? 20 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Becauſe of your unbelief: for verily I ſay unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove; and nothing ſhall be unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto you. 21 Howbeit, this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and faſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, How aſhamed the Diſciples were of this open Rebuke given them by their Maſter; they privately ask him the Cauſe of their ill Succeſs, <hi>Why they could not caſt out Satan</hi> according to the Power promiſed them to work Miracles. Our Saviour tells them, that their Power to work this Miracle now failed them, for a double Reaſon: 1. For their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> by which we are to underſtand the Weakneſs of their Faith, not their total Want of Faith. 2. Becauſe they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the ſpecial Means appointed by God, in order to that end; to wit, <hi>Faſting and Prayer.</hi> That is, a Fervour of Devotion, joyned with Faith and Faſting. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That Faſting and Prayer are two ſpecial Means of Chriſt's Appointment, for the enabling of us victoriouſly to overcome Satan, and to caſt him out of our ſelves or others. We muſt ſet an edge upon our Faith by Prayer, and upon our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by faſting.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jeſus ſaid unto them, The ſon of man ſhall be betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hands of men? 23 And they ſhall kill him, and the third day he ſhall be raiſed again. And they were exceeding ſorry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſervable</hi> it is, how frequently our Saviour forewarn'd his Diſciples of his Approaching Sufferings. All was little enough to arm them againſt the Scand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor can we be too often inſtructed in our Duty to prepare for a ſuffering Condition. As Chriſt went by his Croſs to his Crown, from a State of Abaſement to a State of Exaltation, ſo muſt all his Diſciples and Followers likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money, came to Peter, and ſaid, Doth not your maſter pay tribute? 25 He ſaith, Yes.

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The queſtion put to St. <hi>Peter; Doth your Maſter pay Tribute?</hi> This Tribute-money originally was a Tax paid Yearly by every <hi>Jew</hi> to the Service of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the value of 15 Pence an Head: But when the <hi>Jews</hi> were brought under the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-money was paid to the Emperor, and was changed from an Homage-penny to God, to a Tribute-penny to the Conqueror. The Collectors of this Tribute-money ask <hi>Peter,</hi> whether his Maſter would pay it or not? <hi>Obſerve</hi> 2. the Anſwer returned, poſitively and ſuddenly, <hi>He does pay.

He preach'd it, and he practiced it. <hi>Give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar's. Yet <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. Our Saviour inſinuates his own Exemption, Priviledge, and Freedom from paying this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-money, as he was the Son of God, the Univerſal King: Subjects pay Tribute, but King's Children are free. Tho' Chriſt was free from paying Tribute by a natural Right, yet he would not be free by voluntary Diſpenſation.

Whether Chriſt by his Almighty Word created this Piece of Money in the Mouth of the Fiſh, (which was Half a Crown, for himſelf and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who had an Houſe in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and was there to pay his Poll) or whether Chriſt cauſed the Fiſh to take up this piece of Money at the bottom of the Sea, is not neceſſary to inquire, nor poſſible to determine. Our Duty is, 1. Reverentially to adore that Omnipotent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which could command the Fiſh to be both his Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, to keep his Silver; and his Purveyor, to bring it to him. 2.

               <p n="1">1 AT the ſame time came the diſciples unto Jeſus, ſaying, Who is the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding our Bleſſed Saviour had ſo often told his Diſciples that his Kingdom was not of this World, yet they ſtill dreamt of a Temporal and Earthly Kingdom, which he, as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſhould ſhew forth the Glory of, after his Reſurrection, in which there ſhould be diſtinct Places of Honour, and Offices one above another; and accordingly at this time the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Diſciples led them to enquire of our Saviour who ſhould have the chief Place of Honour and Dignity under him in that his Kingdom. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the beſt and holieſt of Men are too ſubject to Pride and Ambition, to court Worldly Dignity and Greatneſs, to affect a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency before, and a Superiority above others: The Diſciples themſelves were tainted with this Itch of Ambition, which prompted them to enquire of their Maſter, <hi>Who ſhould be greatest in the Kingdom of his Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And Jeſus called a little child unto him, and ſet him in the midſt of them, 3 And ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, Except ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour intending to cure this Pride and Ambition in his Diſciples, firſt preaches to them the Doctrine of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and to inforce his Doctrine, he ſets before them <hi>a little Child,</hi> the proper Emblem of Humility; aſſuring them, that unleſs they be converted, or turned from this Sin of Pride and Ambition, and become as a little Child in Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, and Contempt of Worldly Greatneſs, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That no Sins are more odious and abominable in the Sight of God, than Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, eſpecially amongſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel. <hi>Learn</hi> 2. That Perſons already converted do ſtand in need of farther Converſion: They that are converted from a State of Sin, may want to be converted from a particular Act of Sin: This was the Diſciples Caſe here; they were turned from a Courſe of Sin, but they wanted a Converſion from a particular Act of Sin; to wit, from Ambition.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this little child, the ſame is greateſt in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>As if our Lord had ſaid, That Apoſtle, or that Miniſter, who thinks as meanly of himſelf as a little Child, and is humble and lowly in his own Eſteem, he deſerves the higheſt Place of Dignity and Honour in my Church. <hi>Note,</hi> That the truly humble Perſon, who is freeſt from affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Preheminency, is moſt worthy of the higheſt Dignity and Eminency in the Church of God, and in the Account of Chriſt: The way to be Honourable is to be Humble. <hi>Before Honour is Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 And whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little child in my Name, receiveth me. 6 But who ſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having declared, that the humbleſt Perſons ſhould be always higheſt in his Eſteem; he next declares, how exceeding dear and precious ſuch <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are to him, who reſemble little Children in Humility of Heart, and Innocency of Life: Aſſuring the World, that whatever Kindneſs and Reſpect is ſhewed to ſuch for his ſake, he reckons ſhewn to himſelf; and all that Diſreſpect and Unkindneſs which is offered to them, he accounts as done unto himſelf: So near is the Union, and ſo dear the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt Chriſt and his Members, that whatever Good or Evil is done to them, he reckons as done unto himſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Wo unto the world becauſe of offences: for it muſt needs be that offences come: but wo to that man by whom the offence cometh.</p>
               <p>Two things are here <hi>Obſervable:</hi> 1. The Neceſſity of Scandalous Offences: <hi>It must needs be, that Offences come.</hi> 2. The Miſery and Miſchief that comes by them: <hi>Wo unto the World becauſe of Offences.</hi> Wo to ſuch as give Offence; this is <hi>Va Indignantis,</hi> the Wo of one Denouncing; and, Wo to ſuch as Stumble at Offences given, this is <hi>Vae Dolentis,</hi> the Wo of one Lamenting. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Scandals or Offenſive Actions in the Church of Chriſt, will certainly fall out amongſt thoſe that profeſs Religion, and the Name of Chriſt; <hi>Offences will come.</hi> Their neceſſity is partly from the Permiſſion of God, partly from the Malice of Satan, partly from the Wickedneſs and Deceitfulneſs of Mens own Hearts and Natures. 2. That Scandalous and Offenſive Actions from ſuch as profeſs Religion and the Name of Chriſt, are Baneful and Fatal Stumbling-Blocks to wicked and worldly Men. 3. That the Offence which wicked Men take at the Falls of the Profeſſors of Religion, to the hardning of themſelves in their wicked Practices, is Matter of juſt and great Lamentation: <hi>Wo unto the World, becauſe of Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and caſt them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be caſt into everlaſting fire. 9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be caſt into hell fire.</p>
               <p>This Command of Chriſt is not to be underſtood Literally, as if it were our Duty to Maim our Bodily Members; but the Exhortation is, to cut off all Occaſions that may betray us unto Sin; and to mortifie our darling and beloved Luſts, tho' as dear to us as our right Eye. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Sin may be avoided; it is our Duty to avoid whatever leads unto it, or may be the Inſtrument or Occaſion of it. 2. That the beſt way to be kept from the Outward Acts of Sin, is to mortifie our Inward Affection and Love to Sin. If our Love and Affection to Sin be mortified, our Bodily Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may be preſerved, for they will no longer be Weapons of Sin, but Inſtruments of Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones; for I ſay unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. A cautionary Direction given by Chriſt to the Men of the World, concerning his Members: <hi>Take heed that ye offend not one of my little ones;</hi> that is, that ye do not undervalue and neglect, much leſs injure and afflict them. 2. A Reaſon aſſigned, <hi>Becauſe their Angels being conſtantly and immediately in the preſence of God,</hi> are perpetually ready to execute his Will, by revenging any Wrongs and Injuries done unto his Friends and Children. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. What is the Office and Employment of the Glorious Angels; namely, to be the immediate Attendants upon the Royal Perſon of the Supreme King and Sovereign of the World. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 2. In what Eſteem good Men are with God, and what a mighty Regard he has for the meaneſt of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that he commits the Care and Preſervation of them to the Holy Angels, who are neareſt to him, and in higheſt Favour and Honour with him.</p>
               <p n="11">11 For the Son of man is come to ſave that which was loſt. 12 How think ye? If a man have an hundred ſheep, and one of them be gone aſtray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and ſeeketh
<pb facs="tcp:46556:28"/> that which is gone aſtray? 13 And if ſo be that he find it, verily I ſay unto you, he rejoyceth more of that ſheep, then of the ninety and nine which went not aſtray. 14 Even ſo it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour continues his Argument, againſt giving Offence to his Children and Members; he came into the World to redeem and ſave them; therefore none ought to ſcandalize and offend them. And to illuſtrate this, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts himſelf to a good Shepherd, who regards every one of his Sheep; and if any wander or go aſtray, he ſeeks to recover it with Deſire and Joy. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

               <p>In theſe Words our Saviour gives us an excellent Rule for the Duty of Fraternal Correption, or Brotherly Admonition. Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1.

When private Admonition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails not, Chriſt has appointed Church-Governours, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Church-Cenſures on the obſtinate and irreclaimable. 4. Perſons juſtly falling under the Cenſures of the Church, and rightly excommunicate, are to be look'd upon as Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious and Stubborn Offenders, and the Members of the Church to ſhun Society and Converſation with them: <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man, and a Publican.</hi>

               <p>That is, whomſoever the Officers of my Church ſhall juſtly excommunicate upon Earth, ſhall without Repentance be ſhut out of Heaven; and whoſoever upon their true Repentance ſhall be abſolved on Earth, ſhall be abſolved in Heaven. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſt will ratifie in Heaven whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Church aſſembled doth in his Name upon Earth; whether to the cenſuring of the Guilty, or abſolving of the Penitent. this Power of binding and looſing is by Chriſt committed to his Church.</p>

               <p>Here St. <hi>Peter</hi> puts a Queſtion to our Saviour, how often Chriſtians ſhould forgive Offences to their Brethren, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Repentance. Chriſt anſwers, That there ſhould be no end of our mutual forgiving one another; but we are to multiply our Pardon as our Brother manifeſts his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Not that we are hereby obliged to take the frequent Offender into our Boſom, and to make him our Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but to lay aſide all Malice, and all Thoughts and Deſires of Revenge, and to ſtand ready to do him any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Love and Friendſhip. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That to fall often into the ſame Offence againſt our Brother, is a great Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of our Offence. 2. That as the Multiplication of Sin is a great Aggravation of Sin, ſo the Multiplication of Forgiveneſs is a great Demonſtration of a Godlike Temper in us. He that multiplies Sin, doth, like Satan, Sin abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and he that multiplies Pardon, doth, like God, pardon abundantly.</p>

               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour, to enforce the foregoing Doctrine of mutual Forgiveneſs, propounds a Parable; the main Scope of
<pb facs="tcp:46556:29"/> which is to ſhew, that unleſs we do actually forgive, and paſs by Injuries done to us, we cut our ſelves off from all Intereſt in God's pardoning Mercy, and muſt expect no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs at the Hands of God. From the whole, <hi>Note</hi> 1. That as we all ſtand in need of Forgiveneſs from God, ſo likewiſe of Forgiveneſs from one another. 2. That we all ſtand bound by the Laws of our Holy Religion, to forbear and forgive one another. 3. That Almighty God has made the forgiving one another, the certain and neceſſary Condition of his forgiving us. 4. That ſuch as are inexorable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Brethren, ſhall find Almighty God hard to be entreated towards themſelves. We may expect the ſame Rigour and Severity from God, which we ſhew to Men. 5. That the Freeneſs of God's Love in forgiving us ought to be both an Argument to excite us to forgive one another, and alſo a Rule to direct us in the manner of forgiving each other. Doth God forgive us when he has Power in his Hand to puniſh us? So muſt we, when we have Ability and Opportunity for Revenge. Doth God forgive univerſally all Perſons? So muſt we all Provocations. Doth he forgive freely, and willingly, heartily, and ſincerely? We muſt be as forward in forgiving, as they in provoking.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That whereſoever our bleſſed Saviour went, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> followed him: Not out of a ſincere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but with Deſign to enſnare him; and accordingly they propound a Queſtion to him concerning Divorce; whether a Man might put away his Wife upon any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> was?

It is an Ordinance of God's own Appointment, as the Ground and Foundation of all Sacred and Civil Society. <hi>What God has joyned together. Learn,</hi> 2. The Antiquity of this Inſtitution it was from the Beginning. <hi>He which made them at the Beginning, made them Male and Female.</hi> Marriage is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as old as the World, as old as Nature; there was no ſooner One Perſon, but God divided him into Two; and no ſooner was there Two, but he united them into One. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 3. The Intimacy and Nearneſs of this endeared and endearing Relation; the Conjugal Knot is tied ſo cloſe, that the Bonds of Matrimonial Love are ſtronger than thoſe of Nature. Stricter is the Tye betwixt Husband and Wife, than that betwixt Parent and Child, according to God's own Inſtitution. <hi>For this Cauſe ſhall a Man leave Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleave to his Wife.</hi>

Now our Saviour in his Reply referrs them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Primitive Inſtitution of Marriage, bidding them compare the Precept and their Practiſe together; <hi>for in the Beginning it was not ſo. Learn,</hi> That according to the Word and Will of God, nothing can violate the Bonds of Marriage, and juſtifie a Divorce between Man and Wife, but the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Marriage-Bed by Adultery and Uncleanneſs. This is the only Caſe in which Man and Wife may lawfully part. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, except for Fornication, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Adultery.</hi>

If Infants be capable of Benefit by Chriſt, if capable of his Bleſſing on Earth, and Preſence in Heaven; if they be Subjects of his Kingdom of Grace, and Heirs of his Kingdom of Glory, then they may be baptized.

               <p>That is, Thou that haſt been all thy Days a Phariſee, if now thou wilt be a Chriſtian, thou muſt maintain a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſpoſition of Mind, to part with all that thou haſt in this World, at my Call, and at my Command, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after me. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch as enter themſelves Diſciples of Chriſt, muſt be ready at Chriſt's Call to part with all for Chriſt's ſake that they have in this World. 2. All that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſt's Diſciples muſt be his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; that is, They muſt obey his Doctrine, and imitate his Example, his Holineſs, his Humility, his Heavenly mindedneſs, his Patience and Meekneſs, his Readineſs to forgive Injuries; <hi>and the ſame Mind muſt be in us, which was in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 But when the young man heard that ſaying, he went away ſorrowful: for he had great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:30"/>
               <p>This parting with all for Chriſt ſeemed ſo hard a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the young Man, that he went away ſorrowful from Chriſt. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That a Man wedded to the World will renounce Chriſt, rather than the World, when both ſtand in Competition. 2. That Unregenerate and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men are exceeding ſorrowful, and ſadly concern'd, when they cannot have Heaven upon their own Terms, and win it in their own way. <hi>The young Man went away ſorrowful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Then ſaid Jeſus unto his diſciples, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour takes occaſion from what had paſt to diſcourſe with his Diſciples concerning the Danger of Riches, and the Difficulty that attends rich Men in their way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>A rich Man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Whence <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That rich Men do certainly meet with more Difficulties in their Way to Heaven, than other Men? 'Tis difficult to withdraw their Affections from Riches, to place their Supreme Love upon God in the midſt of their Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. 'Tis difficult to depend upon God in a rich Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>The Poor committeth himſelf to God, but a Rich Man's Wealth is his ſtrong Tower.</hi> 2. That yet the Fault lyes not in Riches, but in Rich Men, who by placing their Truſt, and putting their Confidence in Riches, do render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uncapable of the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And again I ſay unto you, It is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words were a Proverbial Speech among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſignifie a thing of great Difficulty, next to an Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And they import thus much, that it is not only a very great Difficulty, but an Impoſſibility for ſuch as abound in Worldly Wealth, to be ſaved, without an extraordinary Grace and Aſſiſtance from God. 'Tis hard for God to make a Rich Man happy, becauſe he thinks himſelf happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.</p>
               <p n="25">25 When his diſciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, ſaying, Who then can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The Diſciples underſtanding how naturally and ſtrongly Men love the World, and how Idolatrouſly and Inordinately their Hearts run out upon it; they ſay unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord, who can be ſaved? Learn,</hi> 1. That when the general Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which lye in the Way of Salvation, are laid forth, and ſufficiently underſtood, we may juſtly wonder that any are, or ſhall be ſaved. 2. That ſuch are the ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Difficulties in the rich Man's Way to Heaven, that his Salvation is Matter of Wonder and great Admiration to the Diſciples of Chriſt. <hi>When the Diſciples heard this, they were exceedingly amazed, ſaying, Who then can be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 But Jeſus beheld them, and ſaid unto them, With men this is unpoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, Were all Men left to themſelves, no Man, either Poor or Rich, would be ſaved; but God can bring Men to Heaven by the mighty Power of his Grace, he can make the Rich in Eſtate, Poor in Spirit; and them that are Poor in this World, Rich in Grace. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That it is impoſſible for any Man, Rich or Poor, by his own natural Strength, to get to Heaven. 2. That when we are diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the Senſe of our own Impotency, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Power of God, and act our Faith upon it. <hi>With God all things are poſſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 Then anſwered Peter, and ſaid unto him, Behold, we have forſaken all, and followed thee; what ſhall we have therefore? 28 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles having heard our Saviour's Command to the young Man, to ſell all, and give to the Poor, St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Name of the reſt tells Chriſt that they had left all, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; <hi>Behold we have forſaken all.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> how <hi>Peter</hi> magnifies that little which he had left for Chriſt, and uſhers it in with a Note of Obſervation and Admiration alſo, <hi>Behold, we have forſaken all, what ſhall we have then? Learn</hi> thence, That altho' it be very little that we ſuffer for Chriſt, and leſs that we have to forſake upon his Account, yet we are apt to magnifie and extol it, as if it were ſome great matter. <hi>Lord, we have left all?</hi> What all? His tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Fiſher-Boat, and his ragged Nets; a great all, next to nothing at all, ſcarce worthy to be mentioned: Yet how is it magnified! <hi>Behold, Lord, we have left all:</hi> But obſerve our Lord's kind and gracious Anſwer; You that have left all to follow me, ſhall be no Loſers by me. For in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;</hi> that is, at the Reſurrection, when Believers ſhall be perfectly renewed, both in Soul and Body, and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my Kingdom then as I ſit upon the Throne of my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo ſhall you ſit with me in an higher Degree of Dignity and Honour, <hi>Judging the Twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael; that is, the <hi>Jews</hi> firſt for their Unbelief, and then all other Deſpiſers of Goſpel-Grace and Mercy. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That ſuch Miniſters as do moſt Service for Chriſt, and forſake moſt to follow him, ſhall in his Kingdom partake of moſt Honour and Dignity with him, and from him. 2. That as the Miniſters of Chriſt in general, ſo his Twelve Apoſtles in particular ſhall ſet near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Throne of Chriſt, and have an higher place in Glory at the great Day, than ordinary Believers.</p>
               <p n="29">29 And every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my Names ſake, ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Promiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 28. reſpected the Apoſtles; this all Chriſtians, who forſake their deareſt Enjoyments for Chriſt. He aſſures them, they ſhall be recompenſed in this Life an Hundred fold: How? <hi>Non formaliter, ſed eminenter:</hi> Not <hi>in Specie,</hi> but <hi>in Valore;</hi> not <hi>in Kind,</hi> but <hi>in Equivalency:</hi> Not an Hundred Brethren, or Siſters, or Lands, but <hi>first,</hi> he ſhall have that in God, which all Creatures would be to him, if they were multiplied an Hundred times; 2dly, The Gifts and Graces, the Comforts and Conſolations of the Holy Spirit, ſhall be an Hundred-fold better Portion, than any thing we can part with for the ſake of Chriſt, and his Goſpel here. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That tho' we may be Loſers for Chriſt, yet ſhall we never be Looſers by him.</p>
               <p n="30">30 But many that are firſt, ſhall be laſt; and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</p>
               <p>A twofold Senſe and Interpretation is given of theſe Words. The <hi>Firſt</hi> reſpects the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the <hi>Second,</hi> all Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in particular. The <hi>Jews,</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, Look upon themſelves as firſt, and neareſt to the Kingdom of Heaven, but for their Infidelity they ſhall be laſt in it: That is, ſhall never come there. And the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are look'd upon as Dogs, and fartheſt from Heaven, ſhall be firſt there, upon their Converſion to me, and Faith in me. As the Words reſpect all Profeſſors, the Senſe is, Many that are firſt in their own Eſteem, and in the Opinion of others, and forward in a Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet at the Day of Judgment they will be laſt and leaſt in mine and my Father's Eſtimation and Account. And many that were little in their own, and leſs in the Eſteem of others, who had a leſs Name and Vogue in the World, ſhall yet be firſt and higheſt in my Favour. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Day of Judgment will fruſtrate a great many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Expectations, both as touching others, and concerning themſelves. Many will miſs of Heaven, and be laſt, which look'd upon themſelves to be firſt. And many will find others in Heaven, whom they leaſt expected there. <hi>The Lord judgeth not as Man judgeth.</hi> We judge of Men by outward Appearances, <hi>but we are ſure that the Judgment of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Truth.</hi> He can neither be deceived, nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <p n="1">1 FOR the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an houſholder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. 2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he ſent them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his vineyard. 3 And he went out about the third hour, and ſaw others ſtanding idle in the market-place, 4 And ſaid unto them, Go ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into the vineyard, and whatſoever is right, I will give you. And they went their way. 5 Again he went out about the ſixth, and ninth hour, and did likewiſe. 6 And about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour he went out, and found others ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idle, and ſaith unto them, Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? 7 They ſay unto him, Becauſe no man hath hired us. He ſaith unto them, Go ye alſo into the vineyard, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is right, that ſhall ye receive.</p>
               <p>A twofold Sence and Interpretation is given of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The one Literal, the other Analogical. The Hiſtorical and Literal Sence relates to the calling of the Gentiles. The <hi>Jews</hi> were the firſt People that God had in the World, they were hired into the Vineyard betimes in the Morning, the Gentiles not till the Day was far ſpent; yet ſhall the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by the Favour and Bounty of God, receive the ſame Reward of Eternal Life which was promiſed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who bare the Heat of the Day, while the Gentiles ſtood idle. In the Analogical Sence we may underſtand all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons indefinitely, called by the Goſpel into the viſible Church, thoſe that are called laſt, ſhall be rewarded together with the firſt; and accordingly the Deſign and Scope of this Parable is to ſhew the Freeneſs of Divine Grace in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of thoſe Rewards which the Hand of Mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs upon God's faithful Servants. The <hi>Vineyard</hi> is the Church of God, the <hi>Husbandman</hi> is God himſelf, the <hi>Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> are particular Perſons. God's going at divers times into his Vineyard imports the ſeveral Ages of Man's Life; ſome are called early in the Morning, ſome at Noon, others at Night. Now when God comes to diſpence his Rewards, thoſe that entered firſt into the Vineyard, and did moſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God, ſhall be plentifully rewarded by him, and ſuch as came in later, but did faithful Service, ſhall not miſs of a merciful Reward. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That ſo long as a Perſon keeps out of Chriſt's Vineyard and Service, he is <hi>Idle.</hi> Every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Man is an idle Man. 2. That Perſons are called by the preaching of the Goſpel at ſeveral Ages and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of Life into God's Vineyard; that is, into the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the viſible Church. 3. That ſuch as do come in, tho' late, into God's Vineyard, and work diligently, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſhall not miſs of a Reward of Grace at the Hand of free Mercy.</p>
               <p n="8">8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard ſaith unto his ſteward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the laſt unto the firſt. 9 And when they came that <hi>were hired</hi> about the eleventh hour, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every man a penny. 10 But when the firſt came, they ſuppoſed that they ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more, and they likewiſe received every man a penny. 11 And when they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, they murmured againſt the good man of the houſe, 12 Saying, Theſe laſt have wrought <hi>but</hi> one hour, and thou haſt made them equal unto us, which have born the burden and heat of the day. 13 But he anſwered one of them, and ſaid, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didſt thou not agree with me for a penny? 14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this laſt, even as unto thee. 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good? 16 So the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for many be called, but few choſen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1. That the time of God's full rewarding of his Labourers is the Evening of their Days; that is, when their Work is done. <hi>When the Evening was come, the Lord of the Vineyard called his Labourers, and gave them their Hire;</hi> not but that they have part of their Reward in Hand, but it is chiefly laid up in Hope. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That tho' God makes no difference in his Servants Wages for the time of their Work, yet he will make a difference for the degrees of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Undoubtedly they that have done moſt Work, ſhall receive moſt Wages. <hi>He that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully; God will reward every Man according to his Works;</hi> that is, not only according to the Nature and Quality, but the Meaſure and Degree of his Works. All ſhall have Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but all ſhall not have equal Bounty. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in the Diſtribution of Rewards doth not make God an unjuſt Accepter of Perſons; he may diſpence both Grace and Glory, in what Meaſure and Degree he pleaſes, without the leaſt Shadow of Unrighteouſneſs. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Obſ.</hi> 4. That when we have done much Service for God, by labouring longer than others in his Vineyard, it is our Duty to have a low Eſteem both of our Services and our ſelves, <hi>for the firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt:</hi> That is, they that are firſt and higheſt in their own Eſteem, ſhall be laſt and leaſt in God's Account.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And Jeſus going up to Jeruſalem, took the twelve diſciples apart in the way, and ſaid unto them, 18 Behold, we go up to Jeruſalem, and the Son of man ſhall be betrayed unto the chief prieſts, and unto the ſcribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death, 19 And ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him: and the third day he ſhall riſe again.</p>
               <p>This is now the third time that Chriſt had acquainted his Diſciples very lately with his approaching Sufferings and bloody Paſſion. He did it twice before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. yet now he mentions it again, that they might not be diſmayed, and their Faith might not be ſhaken to ſee him dye, who called himſelf the true Meſſias, and the Son of God. The firſt time he told his Diſciples of his Death in general, the ſecond time he declares the means by Treaſon; now he tells them the manner by crucifying, that he ſhould be <hi>Scourged, Mocked, Spit upon,</hi> and <hi>Crucified:</hi> All this he did to prevent his Diſciples Dejection at his Sufferings. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is highly neceſſary that the Doctrine of the Croſs be often preach'd to us; that ſo being armed with Expectation of Sufferings before they come, we may be the leſs diſmayed and diſheartned when they come. Our Lord's frequent forewarning his Diſciples of his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was to forearm them with Expectation of <hi>his</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and with Preparation for their <hi>own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 Then came to him the mother of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee's children, with her ſons, worſhipping him, and deſiring a certain thing of him. 21 And he ſaid unto her, What wilt thou? ſhe ſaith unto him, Grant that theſe my two ſons may ſit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Perſons making this Requeſt to Chriſt. <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s <hi>Children;</hi> that is, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> by the Mouth of their <hi>Mother.</hi> They ſpake by her Lips, and made uſe of her Tongue to uſher in a Requeſt which they were aſham'd to make themſelves. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Requeſt it ſelf, <hi>Grant that theſe Two may ſit, the one on thy Right, the other on thy Left Hand.</hi> Where, <hi>Note,</hi> How theſe Diſciples did ſtill dream of Chriſt's Temporal Kingdom, (altho' he had ſo often told
<pb facs="tcp:46556:31"/> them, <hi>that his Kingdom was not of this World,</hi>) and ambitiouſly ſeek to have the Preference and Preheminence in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. See here, how theſe poor Fiſhermen had already learnt craftily to fiſh for Preferment. Who can wonder to ſee ſome Sparks of Ambition and Worldly Deſires in the holieſt Miniſters of Chriſt, when the Apoſtles themſelves were not free from aſpiring Thoughts, even when they lay in the Boſom of their Saviour? Ambition has all along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Churchmen, and troubled the Church even from the very firſt Original and Foundation of it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Both the Unſeaſonableneſs and Unreaſonableneſs of this Requeſt made by the Diſciples. Chriſt ſpeaks of his Sufferings to them, and they ſue for Dignity and great Places from him, <hi>in optimis non nihil est peſſimi.</hi> The holieſt, the wiſeſt, and beſt of Men in this their imperfect State are not wholly free from paſſionate Infirmities. Who would have expected that when our Saviour had been preaching the Doctrine of the Croſs to his Diſciples, telling them that he muſt be <hi>Mocked, Scourged, Spit upon,</hi> and <hi>Crucified</hi> for them; that they ſhould be ſeeking and ſuing to him for Secular Dignity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Preheminence and Power? But we plainly ſee the beſt of Men are but Men at the beſt; none are in a State of Perfection on this ſide Heaven.</p>
               <p n="22">22 But Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptiſm that I am baptized with? they ſay unto him, We are able.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour in his Anſwer tells theſe Diſciples, 1. That they were greatly ignorant of the Nature and Quality of his Kingdom, which was not Secular, but Heavenly; but the Carnal Notion of a Glorious Earthly Kingdom upon Earth, in which they ſhould be delivered from the Roman Power, was ſo deeply imprinted in their Minds, that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared their Expectation of it, notwithſtanding all the Aſſurances which Chriſt had given them of the contrary. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Courſe which our Saviour takes to cool the Ambition of his Diſciples; he tells them, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect here not Crowns on their Heads, but a Croſs on their Backs; they muſt firſt taſte of his Sufferings, before they talk of his Glory, and patiently ſuffer for him, before they expect to reign with him; plainly intimating, that the Croſs is the way to the Crown, Suffering the way to Reigning, and that thoſe that ſuffer moſt for Chriſt ſhall partake of higheſt Dignity and Glory from him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Confidence which the Diſciples had of their own Strength and Ability for Sufferings. <hi>Are ye able,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>to drink of my Cup?</hi> They reply, <hi>We are able.</hi> Alas, poor Diſciples! when it came to the Tryal, they all cowardly forſook him, and fled. A bold Preſumption makes us vaunt of our own Ability; holy Jealouſie makes us diſtruſtful of our own Strength. Thoſe that are leaſt acquainted with the Croſs, are uſually the moſt confident Undertakers.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And he ſaith unto them, Ye ſhall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptiſm that I am baptized with: but to ſit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but <hi>it ſhall be given</hi> to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> Our Bleſſed Saviour's wonderful Mildneſs and Gentleneſs towards his Diſciples; he doth not with Paſſion, much leſs with Indignation, reprehend them, either for their Ambition or Preſumption, but makes the beſt of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and encourages their good Intentions: He tells them, they ſhould have the Honour to ſhare with him in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to pledge him in his own Cup, and after a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to him in his Sufferings, they might expect to be Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with him in his Glory. Yet <hi>obſerve,</hi> that when Chriſt ſays, <hi>That to ſit at his Right Hand was not his to give,</hi> He means, as he was <hi>Man;</hi> or as he was <hi>Mediator,</hi> for elſewhere, as <hi>God,</hi> we find him aſſerting his Power to diſpoſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>I give unto them Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 And when the ten heard it, they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with indignation againſt the two brethren. 25 But Jeſus called them unto him, and ſaid, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe authority upon them. 26 But it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your miniſter: 27 And whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt might effectually quench thoſe unhappy Sparks of Ambition which were kindled in his Apoſtles Minds, he tells them, that Supremacy and Dominion belong to Secular Princes, not to Evangelical Paſtors, who ought to carry themſelves with Humility towards one another; not that Chriſt directs to a Parity and Equality amongſt all his Miniſters, and forbids the Preheminency of ſome over others, but the Affectation of Superiority, and the Love of Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, is that which our Saviour diſallows. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That ſo far ought the Miniſters of Chriſt to be from affecting a Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Superiority of Power over their Fellow-Brethren, that in Imitation of Chriſt their Lord and Maſter, they ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves Fellow-Servants. <hi>I am amongſt you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>as one that ſerveth.</hi> 2. That ſuch Miniſters as do love and affect Preheminence and Superiority, are moſt unfit for it. and they deſerve it beſt, who ſeek it leaſt. 3. That the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Honour which the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only affect, is in another World; and the way to be greateſt and higheſt there, is to be low and humble here, mean in our own Eyes, and little in our own Eſteem. <hi>Whoſoever will be chief,</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>let him be your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28 Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</p>
               <p>To encourage his Diſciples to this condeſcending Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one towards another, our Saviour propounds to them his own inſtructive Example; <hi>I came not to be miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>but to miniſter</hi> to the Wants and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others, both for Soul and Body. Oh what a Sight will it be, as if our Lord had ſaid, to behold an humble God, and a proud Creature; an humble Saviour, and an haughty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Yea, our Lord urges his Example farther, that as he laid down his Life for us, ſo ſhould we be ready to lay down our Lives for one another. Did Chriſt lay down his Life for us, and ſhall not we lay down a Luſt for him? Our Pride, our Ambition, our Affectation of Dignity and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over others.</p>
               <p n="29">29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. 30 And behold, two blind men ſitting by the way ſide, when they heard that Jeſus paſſed by, cried out, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. 31 And the multitude rebuked them, becauſe they ſhould hold their peace: but they cried the more, ſaying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou ſon of David. 32 And Jeſus ſtood ſtill, and called them, and ſaid, What will ye that I ſhall do unto you? 33 They ſay unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 34 So Jeſus had compaſſion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received ſight, and they followed him.</p>
               <p>This Chapter concludes with a famous Miracle, wrought by Chriſt upon two blind Men in the Sight of a great Multitude which followed him. Where <hi>obſ.</hi> 1. The blind Men's Faith, in acknowledging Chriſt to be the true Meſſias, for ſo much the Title of <hi>the Son of David</hi> ſignifies. 2. Their Fervency, in crying ſo earneſtly to Chriſt for Mercy, and Healing. <hi>Have mercy upon us, thou Son of David.</hi> A true Sence of Want will make us cry unto Chriſt for Help earneſtly, and with undeniable Importunity. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The great Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt towards theſe poor blind Men: <hi>He ſtood ſtill, he called them, he had Compaſſion on them, he touched their Eyes,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:31"/> and healed them.</hi> A mighty Inſtance of Chriſt's Divine Power. He that can open blind Eyes with a touch of his Finger, is really God. His Touch is an Omnipotent Touch. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Altho' Chriſt well knew the Condition of theſe blind Men, yet before he will reſtore them to ſight, they muſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly complain of the want of Sight, and cry unto him for Mercy and Healing. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That altho' Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knows all our Wants, yet he takes no notice of them, till we make them known to him by Prayer. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The beſt Way and Courſe which the blind Men took to expreſs their Thankfulneſs to Chriſt for recovered Sight, <hi>they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. Learn thence,</hi> That Mercy from Chriſt is then rightly improved, when it engages us to follow Chriſt. This ſhould be the effect of all Salvations wrought for us. He praiſeth God beſt, that ſerveth and obeyeth him moſt; the Life of Thankfulneſs conſiſts in the Thankfulneſs of the Life.</p>

               <p n="1">1 AND when they drew nigh unto Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then ſent Jeſus two diſciples, 2 Saying unto them, Go into the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage over againſt you, and ſtraightway ye ſhall find an aſs tied, and a colt with her: looſe them, and bring them unto me. 3 And if any man ſay ought unto you, ye ſhall ſay, The Lord hath need of them; and ſtraightway he will ſend them.</p>
               <p>The former part of this Chapter gives us an Account of our Saviour's Solemn and Triumphant Riding into the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That in all our Saviour's Journeys and Travails from Place to Place, he conſtantly went like a poor Man <hi>on foot,</hi> without Noiſe, and without Train; now he goes up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to die for Sinners he <hi>rides,</hi> to ſhew his great Chearfulneſs in that Service, and his Forwardneſs to lay down his Life for us. But what doth he ride upon? <hi>An Aſs,</hi> according to the manner of great Perſons amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> but eſpecially to fulfill the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. that the Meſſias, a King of the <hi>Jews, ſhould come riding upon an Aſs.</hi> But this Aſs <hi>was a Colt, the Foal of an Aſs, on which never Man had rode before,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Mark Ch.</hi> 11. 12. ſignifying thereby, that the moſt unruly and untamed Creatures become obedient and obſequious to him; and upon a <hi>borrowed Aſs,</hi> the uſe of which he demands; thereby manifeſting his Soveraign Right to all the Creatures; and accordingly he bids his Diſciples tell the Owner of the Aſs, <hi>that the Lord had need of him;</hi> not <hi>our Lord,</hi> but <hi>the Lord;</hi> that is, he that is the Lord of all, <hi>whoſe are the Cattel upon a Thouſand Hills;</hi> he that is Lord of all the Beaſts, and the Owners too. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> That notwithſtanding Chriſt's ſupream Right to the Aſs and the Colt, he will have neither of them taken without the Owner's Knowledge, or againſt his Will; but the Diſciples muſt acquaint him with it, and by a double Argument move him to it. 1. Chriſt's Right of Dominion and Soveraignty over them; he is <hi>the Lord</hi> that ſends for them. 2. His preſent Occaſion for them; the Lord has <hi>need of them. Obſ. laſtly,</hi> What a clear and full Demonſtration Chriſt here gave of his Divine Nature, by his Omniſciency in foreſeeing and foretelling the Event; by his Omnipotency, in inclining the Heart, and over-ruling the Will of the Owner to let the Colt go, and by an Act of Soveraignty as he was Lord of the Creatures to command, and call for their Service when he needed them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet, ſaying, 5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and ſitting upon an aſs, and a colt the foal of an aſs.</p>
               <p>Here the Reaſon is aſſigned why Chriſt rode upon the Aſs into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was to fulfil an ancient Prophecy, that the Meſſias or King of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould come riding upon that Beaſt into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There was not any Prophecy of Chriſt more plainly fulfilled than this. The Prophecy alluded to, is <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Rejoice greatly, oh Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>ſhout, oh Daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>behold thy King cometh unto thee; he is just, and having Salvation, lowly and riding upon an Aſs, and upon a Colt, the Foal of an Aſs.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> the Character given of the Meſſias, he is the Supream King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Church; <hi>thy King cometh.</hi> The Errand that he comes upon, <hi>Bringing Salvation,</hi> and the Entertainment which his Church was to give him: <hi>Namely,</hi> To receive him with Triumphs of Joy, and Univerſal Acclamations. <hi>Rejoice, oh Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>and ſhout, oh</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 And the diſciples went, and did as Jeſus commanded them, 7 And brought the aſs, and the colt, and put on them their cloaths, and they ſet him thereon. 8 And a very great multitude ſpread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the way. 9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, ſaying, Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na to the Son of David: Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, Hoſanna in the higheſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Obedience of the Diſciples, and the Motions of the Multitude; the Diſciples never diſpute their Lord's Commands, nor raiſe Objections, nor are afraid of Dangers, but ſpeedily execute their Lord's Pleaſure, and find every thing according to their Lord's Prediction. When our Call is clear, our Obedience muſt be ſpeedy. What God commands, we are not to diſpute, but to obey. <hi>The Diſciples did as Jeſus commanded them. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Actions of the Multitude, in acknowledging Chriſt to be their King. <hi>They cast their Garments on the Ground</hi> for him to ride upon, according to the Cuſtom of Princes when they ride in State; and they do not only diſrobe their Backs, but expend their Breath in joyful Acclamations, and loud Hoſanna's; wiſhing all manner of Proſperity to this meek, but mighty King. In this princely, yet poor and deſpicable Pomp, doth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our enter into the famous City of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Oh how far was our Holy Lord from affecting Worldly Greatneſs and Grandeur! He deſpiſed that Glory which Worldly Hearts fondly admire; yet becauſe he was a King, he would be proclaimed ſuch, and have his Kingdom confeſt, applauded, and bleſt: But that it might appear, <hi>his Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> he abandons all Worldly Magnificence. Oh glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yet homely Pomp! Oh meek, but mighty Prince!</p>
               <p n="10">10 And when he was come into Jeruſalem, all the city was moved, ſaying, Who is this? 11 And the multitude ſaid, This is Jeſus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</p>
               <p>This is not the firſt or only time that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and troubled at the Appearance of Chriſt; at his Birth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. we read <hi>all Jeruſalem was troubled,</hi> together with <hi>Herod;</hi> and now he that rides into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> tho' in ſo mean a Port, yet there is a new Commotion. <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> inſtead of being thankful for his Company, is troubled at his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That ſuch Perſons and Places a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> have the greateſt Helps and Priviledges afforded to them, are not always the moſt anſwerable in their Returns of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. 'Tis not Chriſt's Preſence with us, but his Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to us, that makes us happy. <hi>Chriſt is daily taught in our Synagogues, and preached in our Streets,</hi> yet alas! Multitudes are ignorant of him, and ſay with the Men of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when Chriſt was before their Eyes, <hi>Who is this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 And Jeſus went into the temple of God, and caſt out all them that ſold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-changers, and the ſeats of them that ſold doves, 13 And ſaid unto them, It is written, my houſe ſhall be called the houſe of Prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having entered <hi>Jeruſalem, Obſerve</hi> his firſt Walk was not to the Palace, but to the Temple, and his Work there was to purge and reform: All Reformation of Manners muſt begin firſt at the Houſe of God. Our Lords Buſineſs was to reform the Temple, not to ruin it. Places dedicated to publick Worſhip, if prophaned and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:32"/> ought to be purged from their Abuſes, not pull'd down and deſtroy'd, becauſe they have been abuſed. But what was the Prophanation of the Temple, which ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended our Saviour? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Within the third or outward Court of the Temple, there was a publick Mart, or Market held, where were ſold Oxen, Sheep, and Doves, and ſuch things as were needful for Sacrifice; many of the <hi>Jews</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Hundred Miles to the Temple, it was burthenſome to bring their Sacrifices ſo far with them: Wherefore order was taken by the Prieſts, that Sheep and Oxen, Meal and Oil, and all other Requiſites for Sacrifice, ſhould be had for Money cloſe by the Altar, to the great eaſe of the Offerer. Nothing could be more plauſible than this Plea. But the faireſt Pretences cannot bear out a Sin with God; therefore our Bleſſed Saviour in Indignation at ſo foul an Abuſe, whips out theſe Chapmen, caſts down their Tables, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates the Honour and Reputation of his Father's Houſe. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That there is a Reverence due to God's Houſe for the Owner's ſake, and for the Service ſake. Nothing but Holineſs can become that Place, where God is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Beauty of Holineſs. <hi>Obſerve, Laſtly,</hi> The Reaſon which our Saviour gives for this Act of his; for (ſays he) <hi>It is written, my Houſe ſhall be called an Houſe of Prayer:</hi> Whereby Prayer is to be underſtood the whole Worſhip and Service of Almighty God, of which Prayer is an eminent and principal Part: That which gives Denomination to an Houſe, is certainly the chief Work to be done in that Houſe. Now God's Houſe being called an Houſe of Prayer, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies, that Prayer is the chief and principal Work to be performed in his Houſe; yet muſt we take heed that we ſet not the Ordinances of God at Variance one with another; we muſt not idolize one Ordinance, and villifie another, but pay an awful Reſpect and Regard to all the Inſtitutions of our Maker.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. 15 And when the chief prieſts and ſcribes ſaw the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things that he did, and the children cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the temple, and ſaying, Hoſanna to the Son of David; they were ſore diſpleaſed, 16 And ſaid unto him, Heareſt thou what theſe ſay? And Jeſus ſaith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings thou haſt perfected praiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That our Bleſſed Saviour works his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles not ſecretly in a Corner, but openly in the Temple, and ſubmits them to the Examination of all Perſons Senſes. A Miracle is a ſupernatural Action, which is obvious to Senſe. Popiſh Miracles are talk'd of by many, but ſeen by none. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That Chriſt's Enemies are never more incenſed, than when his Divine Power is moſt exerted, and his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture owned and acknowledged. When <hi>the chief Prieſts ſaw the Miracles which Jeſus did, and heard the Children, crying, Hoſanna to the Son of</hi> David, <hi>they were diſpleaſed. Obſ.</hi> 3. That Chriſt can glorifie himſelf by <hi>the Mouth of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;</hi> he can form and fit up what Inſtruments he pleaſes, to ſhew forth his Excellencies, and celebrate his Praiſes. <hi>Out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings thou haſt perfected Praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17 And he left them, and went out of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into Bethany, and he lodged there. 18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. 19 And when he ſaw a fig-tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and ſaid unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And preſently the fig-tree withered away.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having driven the Buyers and Sellers out of the temple, lodges not that Night in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but withdraws to <hi>Bethany,</hi> a Place of Retirement from the Noiſe and Tumult of the City. Where <hi>Note,</hi> Our Lord's Love of Solitude and Retiredneſs. How delightful is it to a good Man, to dwell ſometimes within himſelf, <hi>to take the Wings of a Dove, and fly away, and be at reſt:</hi> Yet the next Morning our Lord returns to the City; he knew when to be ſolitary, and when to be ſociable; when to be alone, and when to converſe in Company. In his Paſſage to the City he eſpies a <hi>Fig-tree;</hi> and <hi>being an hungry,</hi> (to ſhew the Truth of his Humanity) <hi>he goes to the Fig-tree, and finds it full of Leaves,</hi> but without any Fruit. Diſpleaſed with this Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he curſes the Tree which had deceived his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Action of our Saviour, in curſing the barren Fig-tree, was Typical; an Emblem of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> in general, and of every Perſon in particular, that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelf with a withered Profeſſion, bearing Leaves only, but no Fruit. As this <hi>Fig-tree</hi> was, ſo are they; <hi>nigh unto curſing. Learn thence,</hi> That ſuch as content themſelves with a Fruitleſs Profeſſion of Religion, are in great danger of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God's Blaſting added to their Barrenneſs.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And when the diſciples ſaw it, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, ſaying, how ſoon is the fig-tree wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away? 21 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, If ye have faith and doubt not, ye ſhall not only do this <hi>which is done</hi> to the fig-tree, but alſo if ye ſhall ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou caſt into the ſea; it ſhall be done. 22 And all things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in prayer, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ye ſhall receive.</p>
               <p>The Diſciples being filled with Admiration at the ſudden withering of the Fig-tree, thereupon our Saviour exhorts them to <hi>have Faith in God:</hi> That is, firmly to rely upon the Power of God, whereby he is able; upon the Goodneſs of God, whereby he is willing to fulfil his Promiſes to us. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Faith is a neceſſary Ingredient in Prayer. Praying without Faith is like ſhooting without Bullet; it makes a noiſe, but doth no Execution. 2. That whatſoever good thing God has made the Matter of a Promiſe, ſhall be given to good Men, praying in Faith. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in Prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief prieſts and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and ſaid, By what authority doſt thou theſe things? and who gave thee this authority? 24 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, I alſo will ask you one thing; which if ye tell me, likewiſe will tell you by what authority I do theſe things. 25 The bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? and they reaſoned with themſelves, ſaying, If we ſhall ſay, From heaven; he will ſay unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? 26 But if we ſhall ſay, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. 27 And they anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid, We cannot tell. And he ſaid unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do theſe things.</p>
               <p>The Phariſees having often queſtion'd our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine before, they call in queſtion his Miſſion and Authority now. Altho' they might eaſily have underſtood his Divine Miſſion by his Divine Miracles. Almighty God never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered any to work Miracles that were not ſent by him; when the Adverſaries of Chriſt can object nothing againſt his Doctrine, they then quarrel with him about his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Calling, and demand by what Authority he doth teach and work Miracles. Our Bleſſed Saviour well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Drift and Deſign, anſwers them one Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by asking them another. <hi>The Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>was it from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> Was it of Divine Inſtitution, or of Humane Invention? Implying, that the calling of ſuch as call themſelves the Miniſters of God, ought to be from God. <hi>No Man ought to take this Honour upon himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. The Phariſees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, they could not tell whence <hi>John</hi> had his Miſſion and Authority, this was a manifeſt Untruth; by refuſing to tell the Truth, they fall into a Lie. One Sin enſnares, and draws Men into the Commiſſion of more. Such as will not ſpeak exact Truth, according to their Knowledge, they fall into the Sin of Lying againſt their Conſciences. Our Saviour
<pb facs="tcp:46556:32"/> anſwers them, <hi>Neither tell I you by what Authority I do theſe things.</hi> He doth not ſay, I cannot, or I will not tell you; but I do not, I need not tell you, becauſe the Miracles which I work before you are a ſufficient Demonſtration of my Divine Commiſſion, that I am ſent of God amongſt you; for God never ſet the Seal of his Omnipotence to a Lie, nor impower'd an Impoſtor to work real Miracles.</p>
               <p n="28">28 But what think you? A certain man had two ſons, and he came to the firſt, and ſaid, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. 29 He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. 30 And he came to the ſecond, and ſaid likewiſe: And he anſwered and ſaid, I go, ſir; and went not. 31 Whether of them twain did the will of his Father? They ſay unto him, The firſt. Jeſus ſaith unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 32 For John came unto you in the way of righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him. And ye, when ye had ſeen it, repented not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that ye might believe him.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this Parable is to ſhew, <hi>That Publicans and Harlots;</hi> that is, the vileſt, the prophaneſt and worſt of Sinners, who upon the hearing of Chriſt's Doctrine and Miracles, did repent and believe, were in a much better Condition than the proud Phariſees; who, tho' they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to great Meaſures of Knowledge and high Degrees of Holineſs, yet did obſtinately oppoſe Chriſt, diſobey his Doctrine, deny his Miracles, and ſet at nought his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the greateſt, the vileſt, and the worſt of Sinners, upon their Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, ſhall much ſooner find Acceptance with God, than proud Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Juſticiaries, who confidently rely upon their own Righteouſneſs. <hi>Publicans and Harlots</hi> (ſays Chriſt here to the Phariſees) <hi>ſhall go into the Kingdom of God before you. Publicans</hi> were the worſt ſort of Men, and <hi>Harlots</hi> the worſt kind of Women; yet did theſe repent ſooner, and believed in Chriſt before the proud Phariſees.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Hear another parable: There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houſholder which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in it, and built a tower, and let it out to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and went into a far country. 34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he ſent his ſervants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. 35 And the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took his ſervants, and beat one, and killed another, and ſtoned another. 36 Again he ſent other ſervants, mo than the firſt: and they did unto them likewiſe. 37 But laſt of all he ſent unto them his Son, ſaying, They will reverence my Son. 38 But when the husbandmen ſaw the Son, they ſaid among themſelves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance. 39 And they caught him, and caſt him out of the vineyard, and ſlew him.</p>
               <p>In this Parable God compares the Jewiſh Church to a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> himſelf to an <hi>Houſholder;</hi> his Planting, Pruning, and Fencing his Vineyard, denotes his Care to furniſh his Church with all needful Helps and Means to make it ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; fruitful; his <hi>letting it out to Husbandmen</hi> ſignifies his committing the Care of his Church to the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, the publick Paſtors and Governours of the Church; his Servants are the Prophets and Apoſtles, whom he ſent from time to time, to admoniſh them to bring forth Fruit anſwerable to the Coſt which God had expended on them. His <hi>Son</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Rulers of the Jewiſh Church ſlew and murthered. The Scope of the Parable is to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the <hi>Jews,</hi> particularly, to the Phariſees, their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Impenitency under all Means, their bloody Cruelty to the Prophets of God; their Tremendous Guilt, in crucifying the Son of God. For all which, God would unchurch them finally, and ruin their Nation, and ſet up a Church among the Gentiles, that ſhould bring forth better Fruit than the Jewiſh Church ever did. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the Church is God's Vineyard, exceeding dear and precious to the Planter and the Owner of it. 2. As dear as God's Vineyard is unto him, in caſe of Barrenneſs and Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is in great Danger of being deſtroyed, and laid waſte by him. 3. That the only Way and Courſe to engage God's Care over his Vineyard, and to prevent his giving it to other Husbandmen, is to give him the Fruits of it. It is but a Vineyard that God lets out, it is no Inheritance; no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever had ſo many Promiſes of God's Favour as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, nor ever enjoyed ſo many Priviledges, whilſt they ſtood in his Favour, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did. Yet tho' they were the firſt, and <hi>the natural Branches, they are broken off, and we Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſtand by Faith, let us not be highminded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="40">40 When the Lord therefore of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard cometh, what will he do unto thoſe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen? 41 They ſay unto him, He will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably deſtroy thoſe wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which ſhall render him the fruits in their ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> At the firſt mentioning of the Parable, the Phariſees expreſs a bitter Indignation againſt ſuch wicked Servants, not conſidering what a dreadful Sentence they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon themſelves, and their own Nation. Little did they think that hereby they condemned their Temple to be burnt, their City to be deſtroyed, their Country to be ruined; but in theſe Words they vindicate God, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves, and own the Juſtice of God, in inflicting the ſevereſt Puniſhments on them.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Therefore ſay I unto you, The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>Which Words are the Application that our Saviour makes of the foregoing Parable concerning the <hi>Vineyard;</hi> which the chief Prieſts and Phariſees did not apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be concerned in, till he brought the Application of it home unto them. <hi>Therefore ſay I unto you, the Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that God can beſtow upon any People, is, his giving his Kingdom to them; that is, all Goſpel-Ordinances, and Church-Priviledges leading to the Kingdom of Heaven. 2. Obſerve the Terms, upon which God either gives or continues his Kingdom to a Church and Nation. And that is, <hi>upon bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Fruits thereof. Learn,</hi> 3. That the greateſt Judgment which can befal a People, is the taking away the Kingdom of God from them. <hi>The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="43">43 Jeſus ſaith unto them, Did ye never read in the ſcriptures, The ſtone which the builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the ſame is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? 44 And whoſoever ſhall fall on this ſtone, ſhall be broken: but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words are taken out of the 118th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood to be a Prophecy of the Meſſiah, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Chriſt applies them to himſelf. The Church is the <hi>Building</hi> intended, Chriſt himſelf the <hi>Stone</hi> rejected. The <hi>Rejecters,</hi> or the <hi>Builders Rejecting,</hi> were the Heads of the Jewiſh Church; that is, the chief Prieſts and Phariſees. <hi>God,</hi> the great Maſter-Builder of his Church, takes this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Foundation. <hi>Stone</hi> out of the Rubbiſh, and ſets it in the <hi>Head of the Corner.</hi> Nevertheleſs there are ſome who ſtumble at this Stone. Some thro' Ignorance, others thro' Malice ſtumble at his Perſon, at his Doctrine, at his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe ſhall <hi>be broken in pieces. But on whomſoever
<pb facs="tcp:46556:33"/> this Stone ſhall fall, it will grinde them to Powder.</hi> That is, Chriſt himſelf will fall as a burthenſome Stone upon all thoſe that knowingly and maliciouſly oppoſe him; and particularly upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> who not only rejected him, but perſecuted and deſtroyed him. Thus Chriſt tells the chief Prieſts and Phariſees their own particular Doom, and alſo declares what will be the fatal Iſſue of all that Oppoſition which is made againſt himſelf and his Church. It will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in their inevitable and irreparable Deſtruction. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall fall on this Stone, ſhall be broken; and on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhall fall, it will grinde them to Powder.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 AND Jeſus anſwered, and ſpake unto them again by parables, and ſaid, 2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his Son, 3 And ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the wedding: and they would not come. 4 Again he ſent forth other ſervants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage: 5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandiſe. 6 And the remnant took his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and entreated them ſpitefully, and ſlew them. 7 But when the king heard <hi>thereof,</hi> he was wroth: and he ſent forth his armies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thoſe murderers, and burnt up their city. 8 Then ſaith he to his ſervants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. 9 Go ye therefore into the high ways, and as many as ye ſhall find, bid to the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. 10 So thoſe ſervants went out into the high ways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was furniſhed with gueſts. 11 And when the king came in to ſee the gueſts, he ſaw there a man which had not a wedding garment: 12 And he ſaith unto him, Friend, how cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou in hither, not having a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and he was ſpeechleſs. 13 Then ſaid the king to the ſervants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and caſt him into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this Parable of the <hi>Marriage-Supper,</hi> is to ſet forth that Gracious Offer of Mercy and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which was made by God in and thro' the preaching of the Goſpel to the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Goſpel is here compared to a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> becauſe in a Feaſt there is Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Variety, and Dainties. Alſo to a <hi>Marriage-Feast,</hi> being full of Joy, Delight and Pleaſure. And to a <hi>Marriage Feast made by a King,</hi> as being full of State, Magnificence and Grandeur. To this Marriage-Feaſt or Goſpel-Supper, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God invited the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſent forth</hi> to invite them, were the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in general; and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt in particular, whom they entreated ſpitefully, and ſlew. <hi>The making light of the Invitation</hi> ſignifies the Generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> Refuſal and careleſs Contempt of the Offers of Grace in the Goſpel. By the <hi>Armies which God ſent forth to deſtroy thoſe Murderers,</hi> are meant the Roman Soldiers, who ſpoiled and laid waſte the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were the ſevere Executioners of God's Wrath and Judgment upon the wicked <hi>Jews. The High Ways</hi> ſignifie the deſpiſed Gentiles, who upon the <hi>Jews</hi> Refuſal, were invited to this Supper, and prevailed with to come in. <hi>The King's coming in to ſee his Guests,</hi> denotes, that Inſpection which Chriſt makes into his Church in the times of the Goſpel. <hi>By that Man without the Wedding-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> underſtand ſuch as are deſtitute of true Grace and real Holineſs, both in Heart and Life in the Examination of him. Chriſt ſays, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> Not Friends, why came you along with him. Teaching us, That if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Perſons will preſs in to the Lord's Supper, the Sin is theirs; but if we come not, becauſe they will come, the Sin is ours. The Preſence of an unholy Perſon at the Lord's Table ought not to diſcourage us from our Duty, or cauſe us to turn our Back upon that Ordinance. The Command to <hi>bind</hi> the unqualified Perſon <hi>Hand and Foot, and to caſt him into utter Darkneſs,</hi> plainly intimates, that the Condition of ſuch Perſons as live under the Light, and enjoy the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel, but walk not anſwerably to their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is deplorably ſad and doleful. They do not only incur Damnation, but no Damnation like it. <hi>Bind him Hand and Foot, and caſt him into utter Darkneſs.</hi> From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the Goſpel for its Freeneſs and Fulneſs, for its Varieties and Delicacies, is like a Marriage-Supper. 2. That Goſpel Invitations are mightily diſeſteem'd. 3. That the Preference which the World has in Men's Eſteem is the great cauſe of the Goſpel's Contempt. <hi>They went, one to his Farm, and the other to his Merchandiſe.</hi> 4. That ſuch as are Careleſs in the Day of Grace, ſhall undoubtedly be Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the Day of Judgment. 5. That Chriſt takes a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notice of every Gueſt that cometh to his Royal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, than any of his Miniſters do take, or can take. There was but one Perſon without the Wedding-Garment, and he falls under the Eye and View of Chriſt. 6. That 'tis not ſufficient that we come, but cloathed we muſt be, before we come, if ever we expect a Gracious Welcome to Chriſt's Supper; cloathed with Sincerity, cloathed with Humility, cloathed with Love and Charity; if we be not thus cloathed, we ſhall appear naked to our Shame, and hear that dreadful Charge, <hi>Bind him Hand and Foot, and caſt him into utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where is weeping, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 For many are called, but few are choſen.</p>
               <p>This is our Bleſſed Saviour's Application of the foregoing Parable to the <hi>Jews;</hi> he tells them, that many of them, indeed all of them were called; that is, invited to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Supper, but with few, very few of them was found that ſincere Faith, and that ſound Repentance, which doth accompany Salvation. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That amongſt the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe that are called by the Goſpel unto Holineſs and Obedience, few, very few comparatively, do obey that Call, and ſhall be Eternally ſaved.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Then went the Phariſees, and took counſel how they might entangle him in his talk. 16 And they ſent out unto him their diſciples, with the Herodians, ſaying, Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth, neither careſt thou for any man; for thou regardeſt not the perſon of men. 17 Tell us therefore, what thinkeſt thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Ceſar, or not? 18 But Jeſus perceived their wickedneſs, and ſaid, Why tempt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:33"/> ye me, ye hypocrites? 19 Shew me the tribute-money. And they brought unto him a penny. 20 And he ſaith unto them, Whoſe is this image and ſuperſcription? 21 They ſay unto him, Ceſar's. Then ſaith he unto them, Render therefore unto Ceſar the things which are Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's: and unto God, the things that are God's. 22 When they had heard <hi>theſe words,</hi> they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</p>
               <p>Here we have another new Deſign, to entangle our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour in his Diſcourſe. Where <hi>obſerve,</hi> 1. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons imployed to put the inſnaring Queſtion to our Saviour; namely, <hi>the Phariſees and the Herodians.</hi> The Phariſees were againſt paying Tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> looking upon themſelves as a free People, and the Emperor as an Uſurper. But the <hi>Herodians</hi> were for it. <hi>Herod</hi> being made by the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was zealous for having the <hi>Jews</hi> pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſuch of the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſided with him, and particularly his Courtiers and Favourites were called <hi>Herodians. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Policy and wicked Craft here uſed, in imploying theſe two contrary Sects, to put the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to our Saviour concerning <hi>Tribute.</hi> Thereby laying him under a Neceſſity (as they hoped) to offend one ſide, let him anſwer how he would. If to pleaſe the Phariſees he denied paying Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then he is accuſed of Sedition; if to gratifie the <hi>Herodians</hi> he voted for paying Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, then he is look'd upon as an Enemy to the Liberty of his Country, and expoſed to a popular Odium: It has been the old Policy of Satan and his Inſtruments, to draw the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God into Diſlike, either with the Magiſtrates, or with the People; that they may either fall under the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the one, or the Diſpleaſure of the other. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. With what Wiſdom and Caution our Lord anſwers them, he firſt calls for the <hi>Tribute-Money,</hi> which was the Roman Penny, anſwering to Seven Pence Halfpenny of our Money, Two of which they paid by way of Tribute or Poll-Money for every Head to the Emperor. Chriſt asks them, <hi>whoſe Image or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription</hi> their Coin bore? They anſwer, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s: <hi>Render then,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar'<hi>s.</hi> As if he had ſaid, The admitting of the Roman Coin amongſt you, is a Teſtimony that you are under Subjection to the Roman Emperor, becauſe the coining and impoſing of Money is an Act of Soveraign Authority. Now you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving owned <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Authority over you, by accepting of his Coin as current amongſt you, give unto him his juſt Dues, <hi>and render unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar'<hi>s. Learn thence,</hi> That there was no truer Paymaſter of the King's Dues, than he that was King of Kings; he preach'd it, and he practiſed it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. And as Chriſt is no Enemy to the Civil Rights of Princes, and his Religion exempts none from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Civil Duties: So Princes ſhould be as careful not to rob him of his Divine Honour, as he is not to wrong them of their Civil Rights. As Chriſt requires all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to render unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, ſo ſhould Princes oblige all their Subjects to <hi>Render unto God the things that are God's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 The ſame day came to him the Sadduces, which ſay that there is no reſurrection, and asked him, 24 Saying, Maſter, Moſes ſaid, If a man die, having no children, his brother ſhall marry his wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 25 Now there were with us ſeven bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and the firſt, when he had married a wife, deceaſed, and having no iſſue, left his wife unto his brother. 26 Likewiſe the ſecond alſo, and the third, unto the ſeventh. 27 And laſt of all the woman died alſo. 28 Therefore in the reſurrection, whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? for they all had her. 29 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the ſcriptures, nor the power of God. 30 For in the reſurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven. 31 But as touching the reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto you by God, ſaying, 32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 33 And when the multitude heard this, they were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having put the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi> to ſilence, next the <hi>Sadducees</hi> encounter him. This Sect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Imm rtality of the Soul, and the Reſurrection of the Body, and as an Objection againſt both, they propound a Caſe to our Saviour, of a Woman that had had Seven Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſucceſſively to her Husbands: They demand, <hi>Whoſe Wife of the Seven this Woman ſhall be at the Reſurrection?</hi> As if they had ſaid, If there be a Reſurrection of Bodies, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there will be a Reſurrection of Relations too, and the other World will be like this, in which Men will marry as they do here. And if ſo, whoſe Wife of the Seven ſhall this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be, they all having an equal Claim to her? Now our Saviour for reſolving of this Queſtion, 1. Shews the different State of Men in this World, and in the other World. <hi>The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Marry, and are given in Marriage, but in the Reſurrection they do neither.</hi> As if our Lord had ſaid, After Men have lived awhile in this World, they die, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Marriage is neceſſary to maintain a Succeſſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but in the other World Men ſhall become Immortal, and live for ever; and then the Reaſon of Marriage will wholly ceaſe. For when Men can die no more, there will be no need of any new Supplies of Mankind. 2. Our Saviour having got clear of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> Objection, by taking away the Ground and Foundation of it, he produceth an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Proof of the Soul's Immortality, and the Body's Reſurrection. <hi>Thus,</hi> Thoſe to whom Almighty God pronounces himſelf a God, are alive; but God pronounced himſelf a God to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> many Hundred Years after their Bodies were Dead; therefore their Souls are yet alive, otherwiſe God could not be their God; <hi>for he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</hi> From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That there is no Opinion ſo abſurd, no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſo monſtrous, that having had a Mother, will die for lack of a Nurſe. The beaſtly Opinion of the Mortality of the Soul, and the Annihilation of the Body, finds <hi>Sadducees</hi> to profeſs and propagate it. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The Certainty of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life after this, in which Men ſhall be eternally happy, or intollerably miſerable, according as they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here; tho' ſome Men live like Beaſts, they ſhall not die like them, nor ſhall their laſt end be like theirs. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. That glorified Saints in the Morning of the Reſurrection ſhall be like unto the Glorious Angels; not like them in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Nature, but like them in their Properties and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in Holineſs and Purity, in Immortality and Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and in their manner of Living; they ſhall no more ſtand in need of Meat or Drink, than the Angels do, but ſhall live the ſame Heavenly, Immortal and Incorruptible Life, that the Angels live. <hi>Note,</hi> 4. That all thoſe that are in Covenant with God, whoſe God the Lord is, their Souls do immediately paſs into Glory, and their Bodies at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhall be Sharers in the ſame Happineſs with their Souls. If God be juſt, the Soul muſt live, and the Body muſt riſe: For good Men muſt be rewarded, and wicked Men puniſhed; God will moſt certainly ſome time or other plentifully reward the Righteous, and puniſh the evil Doers; but this being not always done in this Life, the Juſtice of God requires it to be done in the next.</p>
               <p n="34">34 But when the Phariſees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to ſilence, they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together. 35 Then one of them which was a lawyer, asked <hi>him</hi> a queſtion, tempting him, and ſaying, 36 Maſter, which is the great commandment in the law? 37 Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all my mind. 38 This is the firſt and great commandment. 39 And the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy
<pb facs="tcp:46556:34"/> ſelf. 40 On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sadducees</hi> being put by Chriſt to ſilence, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> again encounter him; they ſend to him a Lawyer, that is, one of their Interpreters and Expounders of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who propounds this Queſtion to him, <hi>Which is the great Commandment in the Law?</hi> Our Saviour tells them, <hi>It is to love the Lord with all the Heart, with all the Soul, and with all the Mind.</hi> That is, which all the Powers, Faculties, and Abilities of the Soul, with the greateſt Meaſure, and higheſt Degrees of Love. <hi>This is the Sum</hi> and Subſtance of the Duties of the firſt Table. <hi>And the ſecond is like unto it,</hi> not equal with it, but <hi>like unto it.</hi> The Duties of the ſecond Table are of the ſame Authority, and of the ſame Neceſſity with the firſt. As a Man cannot be ſaved without the Love of God, ſo neither without the Love of his Neighbour. <hi>On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> That is, the whole Duty of Man required by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, is comprehended in, and may be reduced to theſe Two Heads; <hi>namely,</hi> The Love of God, and our Neighbour. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the Fervency of all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and particularly the Supremacy of our Love, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by God as his Right and Due. Love muſt paſs thro', and poſſeſs all the Powers and Faculties of the Soul; the Mind muſt meditate upon God, the Will muſt chuſe and embrace him, and the Affections muſt take Complacency and Delight in him; the meaſure of loving God is to love him without meaſure. God reckons that we love him not at all, if we love him not above all. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That thus to love God is the firſt and great Commandment. <hi>Great,</hi> in regard of the Object, which is God, the firſt Cauſe, and the chief Good. <hi>Great,</hi> in regard of the Obligation of it. To love God is ſo indiſpenſible a Command, that God himſelf cannot free us from the Obligation of it; for ſo long as he is God, and we his Creatures, we ſhall lye under a natural and neceſſary Obligation to Love and ſerve him. <hi>Great,</hi> in regard of the Duration of it, when Faith ſhall be ſwallowed up in Viſion, and Hope in Fruition; Love will then be perfected in a full Enjoyment. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. That every Man may, yea, ought to love himſelf, not his ſinful ſelf, but his natural ſelf, and eſpecially his Spiritual ſelf, the new Nature in him. This, it ought to be his particular Care to encreaſe and ſtrengthen. Indeed there is no expreſs Command in Scripture for a Man to love himſelf, becauſe the Light of Nature directs, and the Law of Nature binds and moves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man ſo to do. God has put a Principle of Self-love, and of Self-preſervation, into all his Creatures, but eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man. <hi>Note,</hi> 4. As every Man ought to love himſelf, ſo 'tis every Man's Duty <hi>to love his Neighbour as himſelf.</hi> 1. Not as he <hi>does love</hi> himſelf, but as he <hi>ought</hi> to love himſelf. 2. Not in the ſame Degree and Meaſure that he loves himſelf, but after the ſame manner, and with the ſame kind of Love, that he loves himſelf. As we love our ſelves freely and readily, ſincerely and unfeignedly, tenderly and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, conſtantly and perſeveringly; ſo ſhould we love our Neighbour. Tho' we are not commanded to love our Neighbour as much as we love our ſelves, yet we are to love him like as we love our ſelves. <hi>Note, Laſtly,</hi> That the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt and ſecond Table are inſeparable. The Love of God and our Neighbour muſt not be parted. <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not his Neighbour, whom he hath ſeen, never loved God, whom he hath not ſeen.</hi> A conſcientious Regard to the Duties of both Tables will be an Argument of our Sincerity, and an Ornament to our Profeſſion. Let it then be our Prayer, and daily endeavour, that we <hi>may love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelves. For this is the Sum of the Law, and the Subſtance of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41 While the Phariſees were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Jeſus asked them, 42 Saying, What think ye of Chriſt? whoſe Son is he? They ſay unto him, The Son of David. 43 He ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, How then doth David in ſpirit call him Lord ſaying, 44 The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footſtool? 45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his Son? 46 And no man was able to anſwer him a word, neither durſt any man (from that day forth) ask him any mo queſtions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> had often put forth ſeveral Queſtions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly unto Chriſt, and now Chriſt puts forth one Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on innocently unto them. <hi>Namely,</hi> What they thought of the Meſſiah whom they expected. They reply, that he was to be <hi>the Son of David,</hi> a Secular Prince deſcending from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that ſhould deliver them from the Power of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and reſtore them to their Civil Rights. This was the Notion they had of the Meſſiah, that he ſhould be a Man, <hi>the Son of David,</hi> and nothing more. Our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, Whence is it then that <hi>David</hi> calls the Meſſiah <hi>Lord? Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord:</hi> How could he be both <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, and <hi>David</hi>'s Son? No Son is Lord to his Father; therefore if Chriſt were <hi>David</hi>'s Soveraign, he muſt be more than Man, more than <hi>David</hi>'s Son. As Man, ſo he was <hi>David</hi>'s Son; as God-man, ſo he was <hi>David</hi>'s Lord. <hi>Note hence,</hi> 1. That altho' Chriſt was truly and really Man, yet he was more than a bare Man. He was Lord unto, and was the Salvation of his own Forefathers. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That the only way to reconcile the Scriptures which ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, is to believe and acknowledge him to be God and Man in one Perſon. The Meſſiah as Man was to come forth out of <hi>David</hi>'s Loins, but as God-Man he was <hi>David</hi>'s Soveraign and Saviour. As Man, he was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Son; as God, he was Lord to his own Father.</p>

               <p n="1">1 THen ſpake Jeſus to the multitude, and to his diſciples, 2 Saying, The Scribes and the Phariſees ſit in Moſes ſeat: 3 All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do; but do not ye after their works: for they ſay, and do not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſo often mentioned in the Goſpels were the great Doctors, and Spiritual Guides amongſt the <hi>Jews. Scribe</hi> is the Name of an <hi>Office, Phariſee</hi> the Name of a <hi>Sect.</hi> They were both Learned in the Law, and Teachers of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Our Bleſſed Saviour in the former part of this Goſpel held many Conferences with theſe Men, and uſed the moſt perſwaſive Arguments to convince them, both of their Errors and Wickedneſs. But their Obſtinacy and Malice being ſuch, that neither our Saviour's Miniſtry nor Miracles would convince them, hereupon our Lord denounces in this Chapter Eight ſeveral Woes againſt them. But firſt he charitably warns his Diſciples and the Multitude againſt the Pernicious Practices of this ſort of Men, ſaying, <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>Seat;</hi> that is, they teach and expound the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they were wont to do ſitting. <hi>Whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> That is, what they teach you conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God, and agreeable to the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: If they go not out of <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair into their own unwritten Traditions, follow their Doctrine, and obey their Precepts. <hi>But do not after their Works,</hi> follow not their Example, take heed of their Pride and Hypocriſie, of their Ambition and Vain-Glory. Obey their Doctrine, wherein it is ſound; but follow not their Example, wherein it is corrupt. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Miſcarriages of Miniſters muſt by no Means beget a Diſeſteem of their Office and Miniſtry. Charity muſt teach us to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Calling and the Crime. 2. That the infallible Truths of God recommended to us by a vicious Teacher, ought to be entertained and obeyed by us without either Scruple or Prejudice. What the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> themſelves (ſays Chriſt) bid you obſerve, <hi>that obſerve and do.</hi> 3. That no People are obliged to follow their Teacher's Pattern and Example any farther, than it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture-Rule, and conformable to Chriſt's Example. <hi>Do not after their Works, who ſay, and do not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 For they bind heavy burdens, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be born, and lay them on men's ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but <hi>they themſelves</hi> will not move them with <hi>one</hi> of their fingers.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>heavy Burthens</hi> which the <hi>Phariſees laid upon the Peoples Shoulders,</hi> were Counſels and Directions, Rules and Canons, Auſterities and Severities, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and impoſed upon their Hearers, but would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb facs="tcp:46556:34"/> the leaſt part of thoſe Severities themſelves. If we do not follow our own Counſels, we muſt not think to oblige our People to follow them. No Man ought to preſs upon others what he is unwilling to perform himſelf. It is very ſinful to give that Counſel to others which we refuſe to take our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But all their works they do, for to be ſeen of men: they make broad their phylacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, 6 And love the uppermoſt rooms at feaſts, and the chief ſeats in the ſynagogues, 7 And greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</p>
               <p>In theſe Words our Bleſſed Saviour admoniſhes his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and the Multitude to take heed of imitating the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> in their Oſtentation and Hypocriſie, in their Ambition and Vain-Glory, and he inſtances in Three Particulars, wherein they expreſs'd it. 1. <hi>All their Works,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>they do to be ſeen of Men.</hi> To do good Works, that Men may ſee them, is a Duty; but to do all or any of our Works to be ſeen of Men, is Hypocriſie. 2. <hi>They make broad their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries, and enlarge the Borders of their Garments.</hi> Theſe <hi>Phylacteries</hi> were certain Scrowls and Labels of Parchment, in which were written the Ten Commandments, and ſome Sections of the Law; theſe they tied to their Foreheads, and pinn'd upon their left Sleeve, that the Law of God might be continually before their Eyes, and perpetually in their Remembrance. This Ceremony they judged God preſcribed them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt bind them for a Sign upon thine Hand, and they ſhall be as frontlets between thine Eyes. By enlarging the Borders of their Garments,</hi> our Saviour points at the Fringes and blue Ribbonds which the <hi>Jews</hi> did wear upon their Garments, in Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.37, 38. As the Threads in thoſe Fringes and Ribbonds cloſe woven together, did repreſent the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, Complication, and inſeparable Conjunction of God's Commandments among themſelves; ſo the wearing of theſe Fringes was to put them in Mind of the Laws of God, that which way ſoever they turn'd their Eyes, they might meet with ſome pious Admonition to keep the Law of God. Now the vain-glorious <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they might be thought more mindful of the Law of God than other Men, did make their Phylacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries broader, and their Fringes thicker and longer than other Men. 3. They fondly affected, and ambitiouſly contended for the firſt and uppermoſt Seats in all Conventions, as at Feaſts, and in the Synagogues, and loved to be reſpectfully ſaluted in open and publick Places, and to have Titles of Honour, ſuch as <hi>Rabbi, Maſter, Father,</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi> put upon them. Now that which our Saviour condemns is the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> fond Affectation of theſe little things, and unduly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Honour and Glory. It was not their taking, but <hi>their loving the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts,</hi> that Chriſt condemns. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Hypocrites are moſt in affecting Ceremonial Obſervations, and outward Parts of commanded Duties, neglecting the Subſtance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf. Theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> were for carrying a Library of God's Law on their Cloaths, ſcarce a Letter of it in their Hearts. They wore the Law of God, <hi>as frontlets</hi> before their Eyes, but not engraven on the Tables of their Hearts. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. That the Nature of Hypocriſie is to ſtudy more to ſeem Religious in the Sight of Men, than to be Religious indeed before God. The Hypocrite is the World's Saint, and not God's. He courts the World's Acceptation more than the Divine Favour and Approbation.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your maſter, <hi>even</hi> Chriſt, and all ye are brethren. 9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 10 Neither be ye called maſters: for one is your maſter, <hi>even</hi> Chriſt. 11 But he that is greateſt among you, ſhall be your ſervant. 12 And whoſoever ſhall exalt himſelf, ſhall be abaſed; and he that ſhall humble himſelf, ſhall be exalted.</p>
               <p>The Word <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Doctor</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> eminently endowed with Variety of Knowledge, whoſe Place it was to ſit in an exalted Chair, or chief Seat in the Synagogue; their Diſciples and Scholars ſat upon lower Forms at the Feet of their Teachers. Our Saviour doth not ſimply condemn the giving or receiving of theſe Titles of <hi>Rabbi, Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Father:</hi> But the things forbidden, are 1. A vain-glorious Affectation of ſuch Titles as theſe, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſeeking of them, and glorying in them. 2. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns that Authority, and Dominion over the Conſciences of Men, which the Phariſaical Doctors had uſurped, telling the People that they ought to believe all their Doctrines, and practice all their Injunctions as the Commands of the Living God. They did in effect aſſume Infallibility to themſelves. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That there have been in all Ages of the Church, a ſort of Teachers, who have uſurped Authority and Dominion over the Faith and Conſciences of Men. 2. That Chriſtians ought not to ſubmit their Faith and Conſcience in Matters of Religion to any Humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whatſoever, nor to give up themſelves abſolutely to the Conduct of any Man's Judgment or Opinion in Matters of Faith. 3. That Chriſt alone, the great Prophet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teacher of his Church, is the only Perſon to whoſe Doctrine and Precepts we owe abſolute Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>One is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi> 4. As God will abaſe, and Men will deſpiſe the Proud, eſpecially Miniſters, who are ſuch; ſo ſhall God exalt, and Men will honour them that ſtoop to the meaneſt Services for the Good of Souls. <hi>Whoſoever exalteth himſelf, ſhall be abaſed.</hi> This was a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence often uſed by our Saviour, and was a frequent Saying among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13 But wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites: for ye ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men: for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entering, to go in.</p>
               <p>From this Thirteenth Verſe to the Thirtieth, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> have Eight ſeveral Woes denounced againſt them by our Saviour: The firſt is for perverting the Scriptures, and keeping the true Senſe and Knowledge of them from the People. This St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls <hi>the ſhutting up of the Kingdom of Heaven againſt Men.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls it, <hi>A taking away the Key of Knowledge from Men,</hi> which is an Alluſion to a known Cuſtom among the <hi>Jews</hi> in Admiſſion of their Doctors; for thoſe that had Authority given them to interpret the Law and the Prophets, were ſolemnly admitted into that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by delivering to them a Key and a Table-Book. So that <hi>by the Key of Knowledge</hi> is meant the Interpretation and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures; and <hi>by taking away the Key of Knowledge,</hi> is ſignified firſt, that they arrogated to themſelves alone the Underſtanding of the Scriptures; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that they kept the true Knowledge of the Scriptures from the People, eſpecially the Prophecies which concerned the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and ſo they hindered Men from embracing our Saviour's Doctrine, who were otherwiſe well enough diſpoſed for it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is abſolutely and indiſpenſibly neceſſary, in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This our Saviour calls <hi>the Key,</hi> which lets Men into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That great is the Guilt, and inexcuſable the Fault of thoſe who deprive the People of the Knowledge of the Scriptures. <hi>They ſhut the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt Men,</hi> and do what in them lyes to hinder their Eternal Salvation. Men may miſcarry with their Knowledge, but they are ſure to periſh for want of Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: for ye devour widows houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers; therefore ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greater damnation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Wo denounced againſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is for their groſs Hypocriſie, in colouring over their Covetouſneſs, with a Pretence of Religion; making long Prayers in the Temple and Synagogues for Widows, and thereupon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to give bountifully to the <hi>Corban,</hi> or the common Treaſure of the Temple. Some part of which was imployed for their Maintenance. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is no new thing for deſigning Hypocrites to cover the fouleſt Tranſgreſſion with the Cloak of Religion. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> make long Prayers a Cover for their Covetouſneſs. 2. That to make uſe of Religion in Policy for Worldly Advantage-ſake,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:35"/> is the way to be damn'd with a Vengeance for Religion-ſake. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: for ye compaſs ſea and land to make one Proſelyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than your ſelves.</p>
               <p>The next Wo denounced is for their falſe-ended Zeal and Earneſtneſs, in proſelyting Heathens to the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; not with a pious Intention to ſave them, but to ſerve themſelves upon them, to have their Conſciences and Purſes under their Power; and when you have poyſon'd them, ſays our Saviour, by your corrupt Doctrine, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in a courſe of Sin by your wicked Example, <hi>they are more the Children of Hell than before</hi> you practiced upon them. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Great is the Diligence, and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable the Induſtry which falſe Teachers uſe, in gaining Proſelytes to their Opinion and Party. <hi>They compaſs Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte.</hi> 2. That ſuch as are proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyted to Error, are oft-times faſter rivetted in their falſe Opinions, than their Teachers themſelves. <hi>They are made twofold more the Children of Hell than your ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 Wo unto you, ye blind guides, which ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the temple, it is nothing: but whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor. 17 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that ſanctifieth the gold? 18 And whoſoever ſhall ſwear by the altar, it is nothing: but whoſoever ſweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. 19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the the altar that ſanctifieth the gift? 20 Whoſo therefore ſhall ſwear by the altar, ſweareth by it, and by all things thereon. 21 And whoſo ſhall ſwear by the temple, ſweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. 22 And he that ſhall ſwear by heaven, ſweareth by the throne of God, and by him that ſitteth thereon.</p>
               <p>The fourth Wo, which our Saviour denounces againſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is for their falſe and erroneous Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Oaths. 1. They taught Men to ſwear by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 2. They taught that ſome Oaths made by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were obligatory and binding, others not. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they affirm'd, that <hi>if a Man ſwear by the Temple, or the Altar, it was nothing;</hi> that is, he was not bound by ſuch an Oath. But <hi>if a Man ſwear by the Gold of the Temple, and the Altar;</hi> that is, by the Gifts offered to the <hi>Corban,</hi> or Treaſury of the Temple, and by the Sacrifices and Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Altar: Such an Oath they affirm'd was binding, becauſe it was for their Profit, that the Gifts on the Altar, and the Gold brought into the Treaſury ſhould be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moſt holy, ſeeing that would encourage the People to be the more ready to contribute and offer. This horrid Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Covetouſneſs our Bleſſed Saviour here ſharply reproves, and ſhews, that Oaths made by the Creatures, tho' unlawful, yet being once made, did oblige, as if the Parties had ſworn by God himſelf; for he that ſwears by the Temple, ſwears by it, and him that dwelleth therein. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That ſwearing by the Creatures is no new Sin, but as old as the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> 2. That ſwearing by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is a great Prophanation of the Name of God, and a mighty Provocation to him. 3. That this notwithſtanding, if the Matter of ſuch Oaths be not ſinful, they are obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and binding. He that ſweareth by the Creatures, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth indeed by the God of the Creatures: <hi>For,</hi> ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>he that ſweareth by the Heavens, ſweareth by the Throne of God, and him that ſitteth thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: for ye pay tythe of mint, and aniſe, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. 24 Ye blind guides, which ſtrain at a gnat, and ſwallow a camel.</p>
               <p>The next Wo denounced is for the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Oſtentation of a preciſe keeping of the Law in ſmaller Matters, and neglecting weightier Duties. They <hi>paid Tythe of Mint, Aniſe and Cummin,</hi> but at the ſame time <hi>omitted Judgment, Mercy and Faith;</hi> that is, juſt dealing with Men, Charity towards the Poor, and Faithfulneſs in their Promiſes and Covenants one with another. This, ſays our Saviour, <hi>is to ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel.</hi> A Proverbial Expreſſion, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that ſome Perſons pretend great Niceneſs and Scrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity about ſmall Matters, and none, or but little about Duties of the greateſt moment. Hence <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Hypocrites lay the greateſt Streſs upon the leaſt Matters in Religion, and place Holineſs moſt in thoſe things where God places it leaſt. <hi>Ye tythe Mint,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but neglect the weightier Matters of the Law. Obſerve,</hi> 2. That altho' ſome Duties are of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than others, yet a good Man will omit none, but perform every Duty, the leaſt as well as the greateſt, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Command of God. <hi>Theſe things ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25 Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: for ye make clean the outſide of the cup, and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and exceſs. 26 Thou blind Phariſee, cleanſe firſt that which is within the cup and platter, that the outſide of them may be clean alſo.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour doth not here condemn their Legal, or Traditional waſhing of Pots and Cups, or any External Decency and Cleanlineſs in Converſation: But his Deſign is to ſhew them the Vanity of outward Purity, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sanctity, and to convince them of the neceſſity of cleanſing the heart, in order to the purifying and reforming the Life. Plainly intimating, 1. That Men's Lives could not be ſo bad, if their Hearts were not worſe, all the Obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Lives proceeding from the Impurity of their Hearts and Natures. 2. That an holy Heart will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an Holy Life. A Man may be outwardly pure, and yet inwardly filthy; but he that has a pure Heart, will live a Pure and an Holy Life. Cleanſe <hi>that which is within the Cup, that the outſide may be clean alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; for ye are like unto whited ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanneſs. 28 Even ſo ye alſo outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocriſie and iniquity.</p>
               <p>Here we have a Wo denounced againſt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for cheating and deceiving the People with an outward Shew, and external Appearance of Piety and Religion: Their Lives were ſeemingly very Religious, but their Hearts were full of Hypocriſie, and all Impurity, like Sepulchres painted without, and full of Rottenneſs within. <hi>Whence Learn,</hi> That the great Deſign of Hypocriſie is to cheat the World with a vain and empty Shew of Piety. The Ambition of the Hypocrite is to be thought good, not to be ſo; he is the World's Saint, not God's.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: becauſe ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garniſh the ſepulchres of the righteous, 30 And ſay, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. 31 Wherefore ye be witneſſes unto your ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the meaſure of your fathers. 33 Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hell?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:35"/>
               <p>This is the eighth Wo denounced by our Bleſſed Saviour againſt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for their grand Hypocriſie, in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Honour to the Saints departed, <hi>building their Tombs, and garniſhing their Sepulchres,</hi> and declaring againſt their Father's Impiety. That <hi>had they lived in their Days, they would not have been Partakers with them in the Blood of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Now their Hypocriſie appeared in three Particulars: 1. In that they continued in their own Wickedneſs, and yet commended the Saints departed; they magnifie the Saints, but multiply their Sins; and inſtead of imitating their Virtues, they content themſelves with garniſhing their Sepulchers. 2. In profeſſing great Reſpect to the dead Saints, and at the ſame time perſecuting the living. Palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hypocriſie! And yet as groſs as it is, it prevails to this Day. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who magnifie Martyrs, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize Saints departed, have yet added to their numbers, by ſhedding of their Blood. 3. In taking falſe meaſures of their Love to the Saints departed, from their building their Tombs, and garniſhing their Sepulchers; whereas the beſt Evidence of our Love unto them is the imitating their Vertues, and cheriſhing their Followers. 'Tis groſs Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to pay Reſpect to the Relicks of Saints, and Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Images, and at the ſame time, to perſecute and afflict their Followers. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the World has all along loved dead Saints better than the living. <hi>Mortui non mordent,</hi> the dead Saint's Example how bright ſoever, is not ſo ſcorching and troubleſome at a diſtance; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no longer ſtands in other Men's Light; whereas the living Saint's Example is a cutting Reproof to Sin and Vice. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That there is a certain Civility in Humane Nature, which leads Men to a juſt Commendation of the Dead, and to a due Eſtimation of their Worth. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> here, tho' they perſecuted the Prophets, whilſt alive, yet had they a mighty Veneration for their Piety and Vertue after they were dead, and thought no Honour too great to be done unto them. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. That it is the groſſeſt Hypocriſie to pretend to love Goodneſs, and yet hate and perſecute good Men. Theſe Hypocritical <hi>Phariſees</hi> pretended high to Piety and Religion, and at the ſame time killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them that were ſent unto them. 4. That the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honour we can pay to the Saints departed, is not by raiſing Monuments, and building Tombs to their Memory; but by a careful Imitation of their Piety and Virtue, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Holineſs of their Lives, and their Patience and Conſtancy at their Deaths.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Wherefore behold, I ſend unto you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and wiſe men, and ſcribes, and ſome of them ye ſhall kill and crucifie, and ſome of them ye ſhall ſcourge in your ſynagogues, and perſecute them from city to city: 35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth, from the blood of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, ſon of Barachias, whom ye ſlew between the temple and the altar. 36 Verily I ſay unto you, All theſe things ſhall come upon this generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> A Prophetical Prediction, and a ſevere Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. 1. A Prediction, foretelling what cruel Uſage the Apoſtles ſhould meet with from the <hi>Jews,</hi> Killing and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying ſome, Scourging and Stoning others; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was fulfilled in the Crucifying of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Scourging of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Stoning of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and Killing of St. <hi>James.</hi> The firſt Planters and Propagators of the Goſpel ſealed their Doctrine with their Blood, and the Blood of the Martyrs has all along been the Seed of the Church. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. A ſevere Denunciation, <hi>That upon you may come all the Righteous Blood ſhed upon the Earth, from</hi> Abel <hi>to</hi> Zacharias, <hi>the Son of</hi> Jehoiada, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20.) who was the laſt Prophet, whoſe Murder is related by Name in the Old Teſtament. Theſe Words are not to be underſtood as if the End and Intent of Chriſt's ſending the Prophets were, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might put them to Death, and bring their righteous Blood upon themſelves. This was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and Event indeed of their ſending, but by no means the Deſign and Intent of it. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That raging Perſecutors have no Regard either to the extraordinary Miſſion, or eminent Sanctity of Perſons, who reprove them for their Sins. <hi>I ſend unto you Prophets</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>wiſe Men and Scribes, and ſome of them ye ſhall Kill and Crucifie.</hi> 2. That as the Piety of the Perſons, ſo neither can the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the Place diſcourage and deterr bloody Perſecutors from their Rage and Fury againſt the Prophets of God. In the Temple it ſelf, in the Court of the Houſe of the Lord, <hi>even betwixt the Porch and the Altar was</hi> Zacharias <hi>ſlain.</hi> 3. That it is a righteous Thing with God to puniſh the Children for the Impieties of their Parents. This is to be underſtood, 1. where the Children tread in their Father's Steps, and continue in their Parents Sins; which they do, if they do not confeſs them, abhor them, and be humbled for them. 2. This is to be underſtood of Temporal Evils, not of Eternal Puniſhments. No Man ſhall for his Father's Sins lye down in Everlaſting Burnings. As our Fathers Faith will not let us into Heaven, ſo neither will their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety ſhut us into Hell. At the Day of Judgment every Man ſhall be ſeparately conſidered according to his Deeds.</p>
               <p n="37">37 O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! 38 Behold, your houſe is left unto you deſolate. 39 For I ſay unto you, Ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth, till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Our Lord concludes this Chapter with a Pathetical La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation over <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> His Ingemination, or doubling of the Word, <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhews the Vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt's Affection towards them, and the Sincerity of his Deſires for their Salvation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Compaſſion of Chriſt to the <hi>Jews</hi> in general, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in particular, ſet forth by a lively Metaphor and Similitude; that of <hi>an Hen gathering her Chickens under her Wings.</hi> As the Hen doth tenderly cheriſh, and carefully hide, and cover her Young from the Eye of the Deſtroyer; ſo would Chriſt have ſhrouded and ſheltered this People from all thoſe Birds of Prey, and particularly from the Roman Eagle, by which they were at laſt devoured. <hi>Again,</hi> As the Hen continueth her Call to her young ones from Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Night, and holds out her Wings for ſhelter to them all the Day long; ſo did Chriſt wait for this Peoples Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Converſion for more than Forty Years after they had killed his Prophets, and murthered himſelf, before they met with a final Overthrow. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The amazing Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Wilfulneſs of this People, in rejecting this Grace and Favour, this Kindneſs and Condeſcenſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I would have gathered you, but ye would not. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Fatal Iſſue of this Obſtinacy. <hi>Behold your Houſe is left unto you deſolate. Is left;</hi> that is, certainly and ſuddenly will be ſo. The Preſent-Tenſe put for the <hi>Paulo post futurum,</hi> it denotes both the Certainty and Proximity of this People's Ruin. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Ruin and Deſtruction of Sinners is wholly chargeable upon themſelves; that is, on their own Wilfulneſs and Obſtinacy. <hi>I would have gathered you,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>but ye would not. Learn,</hi> 2. How deplorably and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſably they will periſh, who periſh by their own Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs under the Goſpel. 3. That there is no Deſire like unto God's Deſire of a People's Repentance; no Longing like unto God's Longing for a People's Salvation. <hi>Oh</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem! <hi>how often would I have gathered thee? When ſhall it once be?</hi>

               <p n="1">1 AND Jeſus went out, and departed from the temple; and his diſciples came to him for to ſhew him the buildings of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 2 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, See ye not all theſe things? Verily I ſay unto you, There ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour had often acquainted his Diſciples with his approaching Death at <hi>Jeruſalem: The Son of Man
<pb facs="tcp:46556:36"/> must go up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to be Crucified.</hi> Now in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he acquaints them with the Deſtruction that ſhould come upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in general, and upon the Temple in particular, for their putting him the Son of God to Death. The Diſciples looking upon the Temple with Wonder and Admiration, were apt to think that the Temple, in regard of its invincible Strength, could not be deſtroyed; or that at leaſt, in regard of its incredible Magnificence, 'twas great pity it ſhould be deſtroyed; and accordingly they ſay to Chriſt, <hi>See what goodly Buildings are here;</hi> as if they had ſaid, Maſter, what great Pity is it, that ſuch a magnificent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſhould become a ruinous Heap? But hence we <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Sin brings Cities and Kingdoms, as well as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and private Perſons, to their end. There are no pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo ſtrong, but an Almighty God is able to deſtroy them; and Sin is ſufficient to lay them waſte. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That the Threatnings of God are to be feared, and ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, whatever appearing Improbabilities there may be to the contrary. God had threatned <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her Sin, and now it is not all her Strength that can oppoſe his Power. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3. That notwithſtanding Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Worldly Glory doth mightily dazle our Eye, yet how little doth it affect Chriſt's Heart. Even the Temple it ſelf, that moſt magnificent Structure, Chriſt values no more than an Heap of Rubbiſh, when the Impiety of the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had devoted it to Deſtruction. <hi>Not one Stone,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be left upon another unthrown down.</hi> This threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was fulfill'd Forty Years after Chriſt's Death, when <hi>Titus</hi> the Roman Emperor deſtroyed the City, and burnt the Temple, and <hi>Turnus Rufus,</hi> the General of his Army, ploughed up the very Foundation, upon which the Temple ſtood. Thus was the Threatning of God fulfilled; <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Zion ſhall be ploughed as a Field, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Heaps.</hi> The Truth and Veracity, the Faithfulneſs and Fidelity of God is as much concerned in the Execution of his Threatnings, as in the Performance of his Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And as he ſat upon the mount of olives, the diſciples came unto him privately, ſaying, Tell us, when ſhall theſe things be? and what <hi>ſhall be</hi> the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the World? 4 And Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5 For many ſhall come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</p>
               <p>A double Queſtion is here propounded by the Diſciples to our Saviour. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the time of the Temple's Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Signs of that Deſtruction. As to the former, the time when the Temple ſhould be deſtroyed. See the Curioſity of Humane Nature, both in deſiring to know what ſhould be hereafter, and alſo when that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That there is found with all of us an itching Curioſity and Deſire, rather to inquire and pry into the hidden Counſels of God's ſecret Will, than to obey the manifeſt Declarations of God's revealed Will. <hi>Tell us when theſe things ſhall be?</hi> As to their ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>What ſhould be the Sign of his coming?</hi> Our Saviour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them with this amongſt many others, <hi>That there ſhould ariſe falſe Christs, falſe Prophets,</hi> and Seducers, a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Impoſtors, that ſhould draw many after them; therefore he bids them, <hi>Take heed and beware.</hi> Where <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> That Chriſt doth not gratifie his Diſciples Curioſity, but acquaints them with their preſent Duty, to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Deceivers and Seducers, who ſhould have the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to affirm themſelves to be Chriſt. Some, Chriſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, or the Meſſiah; others, Chriſt Doctrinal, affirming their erroneous Opinions to be Chriſt's Mind and Doctrine. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That there will be many Seducers, many erroneous Perſons, and falſe Opinions before the end of the World. For <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Deſtruction was a Type and Emblem of the World's Deſtruction. 2. That ſuch Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers will come in Chriſt's Name, and their Errors and falſe Opinions ſhall be given out to be the Mind of Chriſt. 3. That many will be ſeduced, and carried away with their fair Pretences, and plauſible Deceits. 4. That Chriſt's own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had need to take heed, leſt they themſelves <hi>being led away by the Error of the Wicked, do fall from their own Stedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Take heed that no Man deceive you, for many will come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 And ye ſhall hear of wars, and rumours of wars: ſee that ye be not troubled: for all <hi>theſe things</hi> muſt come to paſs, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, and kingdom againſt kingdom, and there ſhall be famines, and peſtilences, and earthquakes in divers places. 8 All theſe are the beginning of ſorrows.</p>
               <p>The next Sign which our Saviour gives his Diſciples of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Deſtruction, is the many Broyls and Commotions, civil Diſcords and Diſſentions, that ſhould be found amongſt the <hi>Jews. Famines, Peſtilence,</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes, fearful Sights,</hi> and <hi>Signs in the Air.</hi> And <hi>Joſephus</hi> declares, that there appeared in the Air, Chariots and Horſes, Men skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing in the Clouds, and encompaſſing the City; and that a Blazing Star, in faſhion of a Sword, hung over the City for a Year together. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That War, Peſtilence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, are Judgments and Calamities, inflicted by God upon a ſinful People for their Contempt of Chriſt and Goſpel Grace. <hi>Ye ſhall hear of Wars, Famine and Peſtilence.</hi> 2. That altho' theſe be mighty and terrible Judgments, yet are they the Forerunners of worſer Judgments. <hi>All theſe are the Beginnings of Sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 Then ſhall they deliver you up to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and ſhall kill you: and ye ſhall be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all nations for my Names ſake. 10 And then ſhall many be offended, and ſhall betray one another, and ſhall hate on another. 11 And many falſe prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many. 12 And becauſe iniquity ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, the love of many ſhall wax cold. 13 But he that ſhall endure unto the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here goes on, in giving farther Signs of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 1. He declares the ſharp Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhould fall upon the Apoſtles themſelves; <hi>they ſhall kill you.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the keeneſt and ſharpeſt edge of Perſecution is uſually turn'd againſt the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and falls heavieſt on the Miniſters of God. <hi>You ſhall be hated and killed.</hi> The next Sign is the Apoſtacy of Profeſſors upon the Account of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions. <hi>Then ſhall many be offended. Shall betray one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hate one another. Learn hence,</hi> That Times of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for Chriſtianity are conſtantly Times of Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Profeſſion. 2. That Apoſtates are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bittereſt Perſecutors. <hi>Omnis Apoſtata eſt oſor ſui or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis. They ſhall betray one another, and hate one another.</hi> A third Sign is the abounding of falſe Teachers. <hi>Many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall deceive many.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> That the fair Pretences, and ſubtil Practices of Heretical Teachers, have drawn off many from the Truth, whom open Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution could not drive from it. A fourth Sign is the Decay and Abatement of Zeal for God, and Love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>The Love of many ſhall wax cold.</hi> That is, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Man. When Iniquity abounds Trouble waxes hot; and when Trouble waxes hot, falſe Love waxes cold, and true Love waxes colder than it was before: The cold Blaſts of Perſecution blow up the Love of a few, but blow out the Love of many more. Theſe are the Signs laid down by our Saviour, foretelling the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and foraſmuch as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Deſtruction was not only a Forerunner, but a Figure of Chriſt's coming to Judgment, theſe are alſo the Signs, foretelling the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that dreadful Day. <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. <hi>He that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Our Saviour cloſes his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with an Exhortation to Conſtancy and Perſeverance. <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That there is no ſuch way to overcome Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Perſecution, as by keeping our Integrity, and perſevering in our Fidelity to Chriſt. 2. That Conſtancy and Perſeverance in our Integrity and Fidelity towards Chriſt, is ſometimes attended with Temporal Salvation and Deliverance in this Life, but ſhall certainly be rewarded with Eternal Salvation in the next. <hi>He that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:36"/>14 And this goſpel of the kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world for a witneſs unto all nations, and then ſhall the end come.</p>
               <p>Here our Bleſſed Saviour comforts his Diſciples with a threefold Conſideration. 1. That his Goſpel how hated and perſecuted ſoever, ſhould be plainly and perſuaſively preached. <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Goſpel of the Kingdom, becauſe it diſcovers the Way to the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Goſpel's Publication, <hi>it ſhall be preached unto all Nations;</hi> that is, to the Gentile World, not only amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but amongſt the chief and principal Nations of the Gentiles alſo. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Deſign and End of the Goſpel's Publication, and that is for a Witneſs or Teſtimony; namely, for a Witneſs of God's Mercy and Grace offered to Sinners, and of their Obſtinacy who reject it. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the preaching of the Goſpel where-ever it comes proves a Teſtimony to them to whom it comes. To the Humble and Teachable it is a Teſtimony for, to the Scorners and Deſpiſers it is a Teſtimony againſt; or in the Words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>To ſome it is the Savour of Death unto Death, to others the Savour of Life unto Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 When ye therefore ſhall ſee the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of deſolation, ſpoken of by Daniel the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſtand in the holy place, (whoſo readeth, let him underſtand.)</p>
               <p>The Senſe is, when ye ſhall ſee the Armies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who are an Abomination to you, and an Occaſion of great Deſolation where they go; when you ſhall ſee that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deſolating Army begirting the Holy City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then call to mind the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which primarily belonged to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but ſecondarily to <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſhall now be fully compleated. For the Siege ſhall not be raiſed, till both City and Temple be razed to the Ground. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That God has Inſtruments ready at his Call to lay waſte the ſtrongeſt Cities, and to ruin the moſt flouriſhing Kingdoms which do oppoſe the Tenders of his Grace, and can make thoſe whom Men moſt abhor, to be the Occaſions of their Deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then let them which be in Judea, flee into the mountains. 17 Let him which is on the houſe-top, not come down to take any thing out of his houſe: 18 Neither let him which is in the field, return back to take his cloaths.</p>
               <p>The meaning is, As ſoon as you ſhall ſee the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appear before the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> let every one that values his own Safety fly as far, and as faſt as he can, even as <hi>Lot</hi> fled out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and let ſuch as fly be glad if by flight they can ſave their Lives, tho' they loſe their Goods, their Cloaths, and all things beſide. From hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That when Almighty God is pouring forth his Fury upon a ſinful People, it is lawful, yea, a neceſſary Duty, by flight, to endeavour the hiding and ſheltring of themſelves from the approaching Calamity and Deſolation. <hi>When ye ſhall ſee</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>encompaſſed with Armies, then flee to the Mountains.</hi> 2. That in the Caſe of flight before a bloody Enemy and Army, if we loſe all that we have, and our Lives be given us for a Prey, we fare well, and the Lord deals ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mercifully with us.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And wo unto them that are with child, and to them that give ſuck in thoſe days. 20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the ſabbath day:</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour declares the doleful Diſtreſs of thoſe that could not flee from the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> as Women big <hi>with Child,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>give Suck,</hi> who by that Means are like to loſe their Lives. And he farther adds, that it would encreaſe the Calamity, if their <hi>Flight</hi> ſhould happen to be <hi>in the Winter,</hi> when none can fly either faſt, or far; or if they ſhould be forced to flee on the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſcrupled travelling, farther than a Sabbath-Day's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which was about Two Miles. From hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is a great Addition to the Trouble and Diſquiet of a good Man's Spirit, when the Day of his Spiritual Reſt is interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and inſtead of enjoying Communion with God in his Houſe, he is driven from Houſe and Home, and flies before the Face of an enraged Enemy. <hi>Pray ye,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>that your Flight be not on the Sabbath-Day.</hi> That being a Day of Holy Reſt.</p>
               <p n="21">21 For then ſhall be great tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever ſhall be. 22 And except thoſe days ſhould be ſhortened, there ſhould no fleſh be ſaved: but for the elects ſake thoſe days ſhall be ſhortened.</p>
               <p>The doleful Miſeries and dreadful Calamities which were coming upon the <hi>Jews</hi> in general, and upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in particular, are here foretold by our Saviour, partly from the <hi>Roman</hi> Army without, and partly from the Seditions and Factions of the Zealots within, who committed ſuch Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Slaughters, that there were no leſs than an Hundred Thouſand ſlain, and Ninety-ſeven Thouſand carried away Captive, and made Priſoners. They that bought our Saviour for Thirty Pence, were now themſelves ſold Thirty for a Penny. Now did the Temple it ſelf become a Sacrifice, a whole Burnt-Offering, and was conſum'd to Aſhes. Yet <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Chriſt promiſes that theſe Calamitous Days ſhould be ſhortned, for the Elects ſake. God had a Remnant which he determined ſhould ſurvive this Deſtruction, to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed; and accordingly the Providence of God ſo order'd, that the City was taken in Six Months, and the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try depopulated in Eighteen. Whence <hi>Obſerve,</hi> How the Lord intermixes ſome Mercy with the extremeſt Miſery, that doth befal a People for their Sin. On this ſide Hell no Sinners can ſay that they feel the Strokes of Juſtice to the utmoſt, or that they have Judgment without Mercy.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Then if any man ſhall ſay unto you, Lo, here is Chriſt, or there: believe it not. 24 For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders, inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very elect. 25 Behold, I have told you before. 26 Wherefore, if they ſhall ſay unto you, Behold, he is in the deſert, go not forth: behold, he is in the ſecret chambers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had all along cheriſhed in themſelves a vain Expectation, that the promiſed Meſſias ſhould be a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deliverer that ſhould ſet them at Liberty from the Power and Slavery of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and accordingly Chriſt declares to his Diſciples here, that immediately before <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>'s Deſtruction, ſeveral Perſons taking the Advantage of this Expectation, would make themſelves Heads of Parties, and pretend that they were the true Meſſiah, who would ſave and deliver them from their Enemies, if they would repair to them, and follow after them. Hereupon our Lord cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his Diſciples againſt ſuch falſe Chriſts and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and bids them <hi>believe them not,</hi> tho' they did never ſo many great Signs and Wonders, and promiſed them never ſuch Glorious Deliverances. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Church's great Danger is from Seducers that come in Chriſt's Name, and pretending to work Signs and Wonders by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 2. That ſuch is the Power of Seduction and Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that many are carried away with Seducers and falſe Teachers. 3. That the Elect themſelves, if left unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might be ſeduced; but Divine Power guards them againſt Seduction and Deluſion. <hi>They ſhall deceive, if it were poſſible, the very Elect.</hi>

               <p n="27">27 For as the lightning cometh out of the eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the weſt: ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold coming of Chriſt ſpoken of in the New Teſtament. 1. His coming in his Spiritual Kingdom by the preaching of the Goſpel among the Gentiles. 2. His coming to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Forty Years after his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. His final Coming to Judgment at the great Day.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:37"/> All theſe Comings of the Son of Man for their Suddenneſs and Unexpectedneſs are compared unto Lightning, which in a moment breaketh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth unto the Weſt. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Coming and Appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the judging of wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners, it will be a very certain, ſudden, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Appearance.</p>
               <p n="28">28 For whereſoever the carcaſs is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
               <p>If the coming of Chriſt be underſtood in the former Verſe of his coming to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs in this Verſe are to be underſtood the People of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and the Body of the Jewiſh Nation: And by <hi>the Eagles</hi> are to be underſtood the Roman Armies, who carried an Eagle in their Standard. Theſe were the Inſtruments which Almighty God made uſe of, as his Rod and Scourge to chaſtiſe and puniſh the People of <hi>Jeruſalem. Learn thence,</hi> That the appointed Meſſengers of God's Wrath, and the Inſtruments of his Vengeance will ſuddenly gather together, certainly find out, and ſeverely puniſh and plague an impenitent People devoted to Deſtruction. <hi>Where the Carcaſs is,</hi> (the Body of the Jewiſh Nation,) <hi>there will the Eagles</hi> (the Roman Soldiers) <hi>be gathered together.</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour goes on in figurative Expreſſions, to ſet forth the Calamities that ſhould befal the Jewiſh Nation, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem. The Sun ſhall be darkened;</hi> that is, all their Glory and Excellency ſhall be eclipſed, all their Wealth and Proſperity ſhall be laid waſte, their whole Government Civil and Eccleſiaſtical deſtroy'd; and ſuch Marks of Miſery found upon them, as never were ſeen upon a People. <hi>By the Sign of the Son of Man,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, will have underſtood, <hi>the Sign of the Croſs.</hi> Others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of thoſe Prodigies, which were ſeen a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions, as namely, A Comet in the form of a Sword hanging over the City for a Year together: A Light in the Temple, and about the Altar ſeen at Midnight for half an Hour. A Cow led by the Prieſt to be ſacrificed, calved a Lamb. A Voice heard in the Temple, ſaying, <hi>Abeamus hinc, Let us go hence. Learn hence,</hi> God doth premoniſh before he puniſh; he warns a People of Deſtruction often, before he deſtroys them once.</p>
               <p n="30">30 And then ſhall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31 And he ſhall ſend his angels with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>ſhall the Tribes mourn;</hi> that is, then ſhall the <hi>Jews</hi> be convinced that their Deſtruction was the Puniſhment of their Sin, in rejecting and crucifying Chriſt; and accordingly they that pierced him, ſhall behold him, and mourn over him. Thus it was before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thus will it be before the final Judgment. They that pierced him ſhall be brought before him. Lord, how will the Sight of a pierced Chriſt pierce their Souls with Horror; they who have not ſeen a pierced Chriſt in the Sorrows of Repentance, ſhall hereafter ſee him in the Sorrows of Deſpair. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt with the Eye of Senſe hereafter, will be very dreadful and terrible to all thoſe that have not beheld him with the Eye of Faith here. <hi>And he ſhall ſend his Angels with the Sound of a Trumpet.</hi> Thoſe that apply this to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the Angels underſtand the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, who by the Trumpet of the Word did bring in Believers throughout all <hi>Judea,</hi> who were ſaved from that Deſtruction. Thoſe that underſtand it of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment, take it literally, that Chriſt at the great Day will ſend forth his Holy Angels, and gather all his Elect to himſelf with the ſound of a Trumpet. Probably, as there was an audible Sound of a Trumpet at the giving of the Law, ſo there ſhall be the like Sound of a Trumpet, when Chriſt ſhall ſummon the World to Judgment, for tranſgreſſing of that Law. A joyful Sound, will this be to the Friends of Chriſt. A doleful dreadful Sound in the Ears of his Enemies.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Now learn a parable of the fig-tree, When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that ſummer is nigh: 33 So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall ſee all theſe things, know that it is near, <hi>even</hi> at the doors. 34 Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, this generation ſhall not paſs, till all theſe things be fulfilled. 35 Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away. 36 But of that day and hour know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, no not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</p>
               <p>Here our Bleſſed Saviour declares Two Things with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his coming. 1. The Certainty of the Thing it ſelf. 2. The Uncertainty of the Time. The Certainty of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſets forth by the Similitude of the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> whoſe beginning to bud declares <hi>the Summer at Hand.</hi> Thus when they ſhould ſee the foremention'd Signs, they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Deſtruction of their City and Temple <hi>to be nigh at Hand,</hi> and that ſome then living ſhould ſee all theſe Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions certainly fulfilled: Whatever Chriſt foretells ſhall certainly be fulfilled, his Word being more firm than the Fabrick of Heaven and Earth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty,</hi> as to the preciſe Time, when this Judgment ſhould come. No Angel in Heaven, nor Creature on Earth could determine the Time, only the glorious Perſons in the Godhead; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That all things are not revealed to the Angels themſelves, but ſuch things only as it concerns them to know, and the Wiſdom of God thinks fit to reveal. 2. That the preciſe Time of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is kept by God as a Secret to himſelf, he will not have us know that Hour, to the Intent that we may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our watch every Hour.</p>
               <p n="37">37 But as the days of Noah were, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be. 38 For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be. 40 Then ſhall two be in the field, the one ſhall be taken, and the other left. 41 Two women ſhall be grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the mill, the one ſhall be taken, and the other left.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes our Saviour declares that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the World's final Deſolation at the great Day, would be much like the Deſtruction of the old World, and that in two Reſpects; 1. In regard of Unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 2. In regard of Security, and Senſuality. How ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and ſecure was the old World before the Flood. <hi>They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in Marriage.</hi> That is, wholly given up to Senſuality and Debauchery, and did not know of the Floods coming; that is, did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, <hi>till it ſwept them away.</hi> Thus was it in the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo will it be in the end of the World. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That as the old World periſhed by Infidelity, Security and Senſuality, ſo will the ſame Sins be prevailing before the Deſtruction of this preſent World. <hi>As it was in the Days of</hi> Noah, <hi>ſo ſhall it be when the Son of Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> 2. That the true Reaſon why Sinners are drowned in Senſuality, and given over to Security, is this, becauſe they do not believe the Certainty, or conſider the Proximity and Nearneſs of an approaching Judgment. The old World <hi>knew not of the Floods coming.</hi> Strange! when <hi>Noah</hi> had told them of it an Hundred and Twenty Years together. The meaning is, They did not conſider it, and prepare for it. To ſuch as are unprepared for, and unapprehenſive of Death and Judgment, thoſe Evils are always ſudden altho'
<pb facs="tcp:46556:37"/> Men be never ſo often warn'd of them. But to ſuch as are prepared, Death is never ſudden, let them die never ſo ſuddenly.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 43 But know this, that if the good man of the houſe had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have ſuffered his houſe to be broken up. 44 Therefore be ye alſo ready: for in ſuch an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Application made by our Saviour of the foregoing Doctrine concerning the Certainty and Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a future Judgment. <hi>Watch therefore always;</hi> not without Intermiſſion, but without giving over, that ye may be not only in an habitual, but actual Readineſs for my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is the indiſpenſible Duty, and ought to be the indefatigable Endeavour of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to ſtand upon his Watch in a prepared Readineſs, for Chriſt's Appearance, both for his coming to us, and for our going to him. <hi>Watch always, for ye know not the Hour when your Lord cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="45">45 Who then is a faithful and wiſe ſervant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to give them meat in due ſeaſon? 46 Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing. 47 Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall make him ruler over all his goods.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words may be applied two ways. 1. To all the faithful Servants of Chriſt in general. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That for a Perſon to ſpend and end his Days in the Service of Chriſt, and doing his Will, gives good Aſſurance of a bleſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant.</hi> 2. To the Miniſters of the Goſpel in ſpecial, may theſe Words be applied. And here <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Character and Duty of a Goſpel-Miniſter. He is the <hi>Steward of Chriſt's Houſhold, to give them their Meat in due Seaſon. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Qualifications requiſite in ſuch Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Faithfulneſs and Prudence. <hi>Who then is that faithful and wiſe Steward? Obſ.</hi> 3. The Reward inſured to ſuch Stewards as anſwer theſe Qualifications. <hi>Bleſſed is that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are in a ſpecial Senſe the Stewards of Chriſt's Houſhold. 2. That Faithfulneſs and Prudence are the neceſſary and indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualifications of Chriſt's Stewards. 3. That where-ever theſe Qualifications are found, Chriſt will graciouſly and abundantly reward them. Our Faithfulneſs muſt reſpect God, our Selves, and our Flock, and includes Integrity of Heart, Purity of Intention, Induſtry of Endeavour, Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in our Adminiſtrations. Prudence appears in the choice of ſuitable Subjects, in the choice of fit Language, in exciting our own Affections, in order to the moving of our People. Miniſterial Prudence will teach us by the Strictneſs and Gravity of our Deportment, to maintain our Eſteem in the Conſciences of our People. It will aſſiſt us to bear Reproach, and direct us to give Reproof; he that is ſilent, cannot be innocent: Reprove we muſt, or we cannot be faithful; but prudently, or we cannot be ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p n="48">48 But and if that evil ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming, 49 And ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: 50 The lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of; 51 And ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>Our Lord in theſe Verſes deſcribes an unfaithful and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Steward, and denounces the dreadful Sentence of Wrath hanging over him; he is deſcribed, 1. By the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Infidelity, he believeth not Chriſt's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' he preaches it to others; he ſaith in his Heart, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming.</hi> 2. He is deſcribed by his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Envy, and Malignity againſt his Fellow-ſervants, that were more painful and faithful than himſelf. He begins to ſmite, at leaſt with the Virulence of his Tongue, if not with the Violence of his Hand. 3. By his aſſociating with the wicked, and ſtrengthening their Hands by his ill Example. <hi>He eateth and drinketh with the Drunken.</hi> That is, as their Aſſociate and Fellow-Companion. Thus the unfaithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is deſcribed; next his Judgment and Sentence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The tremendous Judgment that ſhall come upon unfaithful Stewards. 1. Chriſt will ſurprize them in their Sin and Security, by <hi>coming in an Hour when they look'd not for him.</hi> 2. He will execute Temporal Vengeance upon them. <hi>He will cut them aſunder,</hi> or hew them in pieces, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did their Sacrifices. That is, ſeparate his Soul from his Body by untimely Death. Hence ſome <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That God ſeldom ſuffers ſlothful, ſenſual, wicked and debauch'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <hi>to live out half their Days.</hi> 3. Chriſt will puniſh them with Eternal Deſtruction alſo. <hi>Appointing them their Portion with Hypocrites.</hi> That is, with the worſt of Sinners, they ſhall have a double Damnation. As the Hypocrite has a double Heart, a double Tongue, and is a double Sinner, ſo ſhall he undergo a double Damnation. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſuch Miniſters as neglect the Service of God, and the Souls of their People; as they are ranked amongſt the worſt ſort of Sinners in this Life, ſo ſhall they be puniſhed with them in the ſevereſt manner in the next. When Satan deſtroys the Souls of Men, he ſhall anſwer for it as a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer only, not as an Officer that was intruſted with the Care of Souls. But if the Steward doth not provide, if the Shepherd doth not feed, if the Watchman doth not warn, they ſhall anſwer not only for the Souls that have miſcarried, but for an <hi>Office neglected,</hi> for a Talent hidden, and for a Stewardſhip unfaithfully adminiſtred. Wo unto us, if at the great Day we hear diſtreſſed Souls roaring out their Complaints, and howling forth that doleful Accuſation againſt us: Lord! Our Stewards have defrauded us, our Watchmen have betrayed us, our Guides have miſled us.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p> Our bleſſed Saviour in the Cloſe of the foregoing Chapter had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted all Chriſtians to the great Duty of Watchfulneſs, and to be in a Poſture of Readineſs againſt his coming. Which Duty he is pleaſed to inculcate again in this Chapter, and accordingly he urges the Neceſſity of it from two eminent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables; the former, <hi>Of the Ten Virgins, v. 1.</hi> and the latter, <hi>Of a Man travelling into a far Country, v. 14.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THen ſhall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. 2 And five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</p>
               <p>By the Kingdom of Heaven here is meant the State of the viſible Church here on Earth; it cannot be underſtood of the Kingdom of Glory, for there are no fooliſh Virgins in that Kingdom, nor yet of the inviſible Kingdom of Grace; for therein are no fooliſh Virgins neither. But in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church here on Earth there ever has been a Mixture of wiſe and unwiſe, of Saints and Hypocrites. <hi>Five of theſe Virgins were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> our Lord's great Charity, in ſuppoſing and hoping that amongſt the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, the number of ſincere Chriſtians is equal with Hypocritical Profeſſors. <hi>Five were wiſe, and Five fooliſh.</hi> Teaching us, that we ſhould not confine the Church of Chriſt within a narrow Compaſs, nor confine our Charity to a few, and think none ſhall go to Heaven but thoſe of our own Party and Perſwaſion, but to extend our Charity to all Chriſtians that hold the Foundation with us, and to hope well of them. Lord! let me rather err on the charitable Hand, than be found on the cenſorious and damning ſide; this is to imitate my Saviour, whoſe Charity ſuppoſed as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe as fooliſh Virgins, as many Saints as Hypocrites in the Church. All theſe Virgins are ſaid to <hi>take their Lamps,</hi> and <hi>go forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> For underſtanding which, we muſt know, that our Saviour alludes to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Marriages, which were celebrated in the Night;
<pb facs="tcp:46556:38"/> when uſually Ten young Men attended the Bridegroom, and as many Virgins attended the Bride, with Lamps in their Hands, the Bridegroom leading home his Bride by the Light of thoſe Lamps. By theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> are ſhadowed forth the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity. The <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> are ſuch as ſatisfie themſelves with a bare Profeſſion, without bringing forth Fruits anſwerable thereunto. The <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> are ſuch as walk'd anſwerable to their Profeſſion, perſevered and continued ſtedfaſt therein, and abounded in the Graces and Virtues of a good Life. They are called <hi>Virgins</hi> for the Purity of their Faith, for the Purity of their Worſhip, and for the Purity of their Converſations.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They that were fooliſh took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 4 But the wiſe took oil in their veſſels with their lamps.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Lamps</hi> are meant an outward Profeſſion of Faith and Holineſs. By <hi>Oil in their Lamps</hi> is to be underſtood that ſolemn Profeſſion of Repentance, and Faith, which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians make in Baptiſm. By <hi>Oil in the Veſſels</hi> is meant the Sanctifying and Saving Graces of the Holy Spirit; the Growth and Improvement of them, with Conſtancy and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in them. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> wherein the wiſe and fooliſh Virgins agreed, and wherein they differed. They agreed thus far, that both took their <hi>Lamps,</hi> both <hi>lighted</hi> them, they both had <hi>Oil in their Lamps;</hi> the difference was not that the wiſe had Oil, and the fooliſh had none, but in this, that the wiſe took care for a future Supply of Oil to feed their Lamp. When the firſt Oil was ſpent, ſome Profeſſors, like <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> content themſelves with a blazing Lamp of an outward Profeſſion, without concerning themſelves to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an inward Principle of Grace and Love, which ſhould maintain that Profeſſion, as the Oil maintains the Lamp. As the Lamp will not long hold burning without a Stock of Oil to feed it; ſo a Profeſſion of Religion, tho' never ſo glorious, will not be laſting nor perſevering without a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Faith and Love in the Heart to ſupport and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the true Wiſdom of a Chriſtian conſiſts in this, to take care, that not only the <hi>Lamp</hi> of his Life may ſhine by outward Profeſſion, but that the Veſſel of his Heart may be furniſhed with the Graces of the Holy Spirit, as a prevailing and abiding Principle.</p>
               <p n="5">5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbered and ſlept.</p>
               <p>That is, while Chriſt delays his coming to Perſons by Death and Judgment, they are not ſo diligent as they ought, to prepare themſelves for Death and Judgment. Inſtead of being upon their Watch and Guard, <hi>they ſlumbered and ſlept. Note,</hi> That not only viſible Profeſſors, but the holieſt and beſt of Chriſtians are very prone to Spiritual Slumber. <hi>Whilſt the Bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbered and ſlept.</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Slumber conſiſts in this. When Graces are not lively, and kept in exerciſe, particularly Faith, Hope, and Love; when there is an Abatement of our Love and Zeal, an Intermiſſion of our Care and Watchfulneſs; this is a degree of Spiritual Slumber, yet the Saints Slumber is not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Slumber, 'tis nor an Univerſal Slumber, 'tis not in all the Faculties of the Soul; if there be Deadneſs in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, yet is there not Searedneſs in the Conſcience. <hi>I ſleep,</hi> ſays the Church, <hi>but my Heart awaketh, Cant.</hi> 5.2. Still there is a Principle in the Soul which takes God's part, and the Chriſtian groans under the Burthen of his dull and drowſie State. But the greateſt Wiſdom is, to maintain a conſtant Watch; that we may at no time be ſurprized by the Bridegroom's coming, or be in a Confuſion when Death and Judgment ſhall overtake us. Bleſſed are thoſe Virgins, whoſe Lamps always burn bright.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At Midnight,</hi> that is, at the moſt diſmal and unſeaſonable time, when all the Virgins were faſt aſleep; and when awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in great Affrightment, could not on a ſudden conſider what to do. Such is the Caſe of thoſe who put off their Repentance, and Preparation for another World, till they are ſurprized by Death and Judgment. Lord, how will the Midnight Cry of the Bridegroom's coming terrifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze the unprepared Soul! What a ſurprizing Word will this be, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh? Learn hence,</hi> That the Bridegroom will certainly come, tho' at his own time; and then all ſhall be called upon, both prepared and unprepared, to go forth to meet him. Reaſon ſays he may come, becauſe there is a juſt God that will render to every one according to his Deeds, and reward both Body and Soul for all the Services they have done for God. The Body ſhall not always remain like a ſolitary Widow in the Duſt, but ſhall meet its old Companion the Soul again. And as Reaſon ſays he may come, Faith ſays he will come, and argues from the Promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. and from the Purchaſe of Chriſt; from Chriſt's Affection to us, and from our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him: Faith has ſeen him upon the Croſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines ſhe ſhall ſee him in the Clouds. The Bridegroom will certainly come at his own time, happy they that are ready to <hi>go forth to meet him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Then all thoſe virgins aroſe, and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the fooliſh ſaid unto the wiſe, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.</p>
               <p>The Virgins ariſing, and trimming their Lamps, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note their actual Preparation for Chriſt's Coming and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and their putting themſelves into a Poſture of Readineſs to receive him. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apprehenſion of the Certainty and Suddenneſs of our Lord's Coming and Approach will rouze us out of our Spiritual Slumber, and prepare us to meet him with Joy and Aſſurance. <hi>Then they aroſe and trimmed their Lamps. And the fooliſh ſaid to the wiſe, give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are gone out. Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A Requeſt made, <hi>Give us of your Oil.</hi> There is a time when the Neglecters of Grace will be made ſenſible of the Worth of Grace by the want of it.

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The wiſe Virgins Denial, <hi>Not ſo.</hi> They will part with no Oil. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it muſt be the Care of every one to get Grace of his own, otherwiſe the Grace of others will do him no Good. 'Tis not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done, nay, not what Chriſt himſelf has done, that will ſave us, without our own Endeavours. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Reaſon of their Denial, <hi>Leſt there be not enough for us and you. Thence Note,</hi> That ſuch Chriſtians as have moſt Grace, or the largeſt Stock of Grace, have none to ſpare; none to ſpare, in regard of their Occaſions for Grace on Earth, and in regard of their Expectations of Glory in Heaven. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3.

It is no time to get Grace when the Bridegroom is come, and the Day of Grace is paſt and over.</p>

The Door is ſhut againſt them, the Door of Repentance, the Door of Hope, the Door of Salvation, all ſhut, eternally ſhut, <hi>and by him that ſhutteth, and none can open. Learn hence,</hi> The utter Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ever getting our Condition altered by us, when the Day of Grace and Salvation is once over with us. Wo to ſuch Souls, who by the Folly of their own Delays have cauſed the Door of Converſion and Remiſſion to be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly ſhut againſt their own Souls.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Afterward came alſo the other virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Virgin's Petition, and the Bridegroom's Reply. The Petition, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us. Learn thence,</hi> That how negligent ſoever Men are of Heaven and Salvation here, there are none but will deſire it earneſtly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately hereafter, <hi>Afterwards;</hi> that is, when too late. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther the Bridegroom's Reply, <hi>I know you not;</hi> that is, I own and approve you not. There is a twofold Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Chriſt has, a Knowledge of ſimple Intuition, and a Knowledge of ſpecial Approbation; the former Knowledge Chriſt has of all Men, the latter only of good Men. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it will be a dreadful Miſery for any Perſons, but eſpecially for ſuch as have been eminent Profeſſors, to be diſowned by Chriſt at his coming, to hear that dreadful Word from the Mouth of Chriſt, <hi>Verily, I know you not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day, nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>
               <p>Here we have our Lord's Application of the foregoing Parable, to be always upon our Watch, continually upon our Guard to meet the Bridegroom in Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe we know not the time of his Coming and Approach. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Watchfulneſs and a prepared Readineſs is a great Duty that lyes upon all thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and look for Chriſt's Coming and Appearance. Happy Souls, who are found in a Poſture of Readineſs at the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Approach, ſtanding with <hi>Lamps trimmed, Loins girded, Lights burning;</hi> that is, improving and exerciſing their Graces, abounding in all the Fruits of the Spirit, and in all the ſubſtantial Virtues of a good Life. Such and only ſuch ſhall have an Entrance abundantly adminiſtered unto them into the everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="14">14 For <hi>the kingdom of heaven is</hi> as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own ſervants, and delivered unto them his goods: 15 And unto one he gave five talents, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, and to another one, to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſeveral ability, and ſtraightway took his journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Perſon intruſting, Chriſt; the Perſons intruſted, all Chriſtians: The Talents they are intruſted with, Goods; that is, Goods of Providence, Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; Gifts of Mind, Wiſdom, Parts, and Learning; Gifts of Grace, all theſe Goods, Chriſt diſpenſes variouſly; more to ſome, fewer to others, but with Expectation of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Chriſt is the great Lord of the Univerſe, and Owner of all his Servant's Goods and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. 2. That every Talent is given us by our Lord to improve and imploy for our Maſter's Uſe and Service. 3. That it pleaſes the Lord to diſpence his Gifts variouſly amongſt his Servants, to ſome he commits more, to others fewer Talents. 4. That to this Lord of ours every one of us muſt be accountable and reſponſible for every Talent committed to us, and intruſted with us.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the ſame, and made <hi>them</hi> other five talents. 17 And likewiſe he that had received two, he alſo gained other two. 18 But he that had received one, went and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>
               <p>The former Verſes gave an Account of the Lord's Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; theſe acquaint us with the Servants Negotiation. Some traded with, and made Improvement of their Talents, others traded not at all; yet is it not ſaid, that they did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzle the Talent, but not improve it. <hi>Learn,</hi> It is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtifie us, that we do not abuſe our Talents; 'tis Fault enough to hide them, and not improve them; the ſlothful Servant ſhall no more eſcape Puniſhment, than the waſteful Servant.</p>
               <p n="19">19 After a long time, the lord of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 20 And ſo he that had received five talents, came and brought other five talents, ſaying, Lord, thou delivered'ſt unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beſides them five talents mo. 21 His Lord ſaid unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 22 He alſo that had received two talents, came and ſaid, Lord, thou delivered'ſt unto me two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: behold, I have gained two other talents beſides them. 23 His lord ſaid unto him, Well done, good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been; faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. That the Wiſdom of God diſpences his Gifts and Graces variouſly, as ſo many Talents to his Servants, to be imployed and improved for his own Glory, and his Churches Good. 2. That all ſuch Servants as have received any Talents, muſt look to reckon and account for them; and this Account muſt be particular, perſonal, exact and impartial. 3. That all ſuch Servants as have been faithful in improving their Talents, at Chriſt's coming ſhall be both commended and rewarded alſo. <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant: enter into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That the State of the Bleſſed is a State <hi>of Joy.</hi> 2. That the Joy which the Bleſſed partake of, is <hi>the Joy of their Lord;</hi> that is, the Joy which he provides, and which he poſſeſſes. 3. That the way after which the Saints partake of this Joy, is <hi>by entring into it,</hi> which denotes the higheſt, and the fulleſt Participation of it. The Joy is too great to enter into them, they muſt enter into that; <hi>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 Then he which had received the one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, came and ſaid, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou haſt not ſowen, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed: 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou haſt that is thine. 26 His lord anſwered and ſaid unto him, Thou wicked and ſlothful ſervant, thou kneweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where I have not ſtrawed: 27 Thou oughteſt therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I ſhould have received mine own with uſury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That he that received but One Talent, is called to an Account as well as he that received Five. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that have but One Talent, namely, the Light of Nature, muſt give an Account for that One Talent, as well as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that have Five, muſt account for Five. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant's Allegation; <hi>I knew thee to be an hard man, and I was afraid.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> His Prejudice againſt his Maſter, and the effect of that Prejudice, <hi>he was afraid;</hi> and the Fruit
<pb facs="tcp:46556:39"/> of his Fear, <hi>He hid his Talent in the Earth. Learn hence,</hi> That Sinners entertain in their Minds very hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Thoughts of God; they look upon him as an hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, rigorous in his Commands, and difficult to be pleaſed. <hi>Learn</hi> 2. That ſuch hard Thoughts of God do naturally occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſlaviſh Fear, which is a great Hinderance to the faithful Diſcharge of our Duty to God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Maſter's Reply to the ſlothful Servant's Allegation, which contains an Expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or upbraiding of him for his Sloth and Negligence; <hi>Thou wicked and ſlothful Servant.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the ſlothful Servant is a wicked Servant, as well as the unfaithful Servant. 2. That wicked and ſlothful Servants, to excuſe themſelves, will not ſtick to charge their Miſcarriages upon God himſelf. <hi>Thou wert an hard Man.</hi> 3. That no Excuſes whatſoever ſhall ſerve either the ſlothful or unfaithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at the Bar of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. 29 For unto every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance: but from him that hath not ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath. 30 And caſt ye the unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant into outer darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words contain the Sentence denounced by Chriſt upon the ſlothful Servant; his Puniſhment is firſt a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Loſs. <hi>Take the Talent from him. Learn thence,</hi> That not improving the Gifts of God given as Talents to us, provokes God to take them from us, as well as miſ-impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. <hi>From him that hath not;</hi> that is, from him that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth not, <hi>ſhall be taken from him that which he hath.</hi> 2. Follows the Puniſhment of Senſe, <hi>Caſt him into utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth. Learn thence,</hi> That Hell is a Place and State of inexpreſſible Miſery and Torment. A diſmal Place, as being deprived of the Sight and Enjoyment of God, of Chriſt, of Saints and Angels. A doleful Place, full of overwhelming Sorrow and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grief. <hi>The gnaſhing of their Teeth</hi> ſignifies their being full of Rage and Indignation againſt God, againſt the Saints, and againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="31">31 When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory. 32 And before him ſhall be gathered all nations; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats: 33 And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
               <p>From hence, to the end of the Chapter, we have a Draught and Scheme of the general Judgment. Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> the Perſon judging, <hi>the Son of Man;</hi> the Perſons judged, <hi>Good and Bad;</hi> the one called <hi>Sheep,</hi> for their Innocency and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the other <hi>Goats,</hi> for their Unrulineſs and Uncleanneſs. <hi>Obſerve</hi> alſo the manner of his coming to Judgment, moſt Auguſt and Glorious. Glorious in his Perſon, glorious in his Attendants. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſt's Appearance at the great Day to the judging of the World, it will be a ſplendid and a glorious Appearance. He <hi>will come with Power, and in great Glory,</hi> in regard of the Dignity of his Perſon, and the Quality of his Office, and the Greatneſs of his Work. He will appear as a King in the midſt of his Nobles, to take off the Scandal and Ignominy of the Croſs, and as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his Abaſement and Humiliation. To ſtrike the Hearts of his Enemies with Dread and Fear, and to fill the Souls of his People with Joy and Confidence. Let us therefore propound it to our Faith; to believe, it to our Fear, to tremble at the Thoughts of it; to our Hope and Love, that we may expect and wait, look and long for it. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther the Work of this Judge, <hi>firſt,</hi> to congregate; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to ſegregate. He ſhall firſt <hi>gather all Nations. Learn,</hi> That at the general Judgment all that have lived ſhall be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to the Bar of Chriſt; Perſons of all Sexes, of all Ages, of all Nations, of all Conditions; having gathered them together, he ſhall next ſegregate and <hi>ſeparate them, as a Shepherd his Sheep.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That tho' there be a Mixture and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Godly, and the Wicked here, yet at the Day of Judgment there will be a Separation made betwixt them, and they ſhall never come together more.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Then ſhall the king ſay unto them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>Here follows the Sentence which Chriſt will pronounce upon the Righteous and the Wicked at the great Day; firſt the Sentence of Abſolution upon the Righteous, then the Sentence of Condemnation upon the Wicked. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That at the Day of Judgment the Godly ſhall be abſolved before the Wicked are condemned. The Reaſons are, becauſe 'tis more delightful to God to reward, than to puniſh; to ſave, than to deſtroy; becauſe 'tis ſuitable to Chriſt's Love to begin with his Saints, and to be admired by them. Alſo to put his Saints out of Fear, as to their Eternal Condition, and to bring them near to himſelf, and to ſet them upon the Throne with himſelf, as Aſſeſſors and Judges of the wicked World. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the World? Laſtly,</hi> With reſpect to the Wicked, that they may be the more affected with their Loſs, and have a vexatious and tormenting Senſe of that Happineſs which they have refuſed. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the joyful Sentence pronounced, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The joyful Compellation, <hi>Ye Bleſſed.</hi> Which Term is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to theſe Two Things. 1. To the Worlds Judgment of them, which accounts them vile and accurſed. Here is an Abſolution from their unjuſt Cenſures. 2. To the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law, which pronounces all its Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. but ſays Chriſt, I that have redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from the Curſe of the Law, pronounce you <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> But why, <hi>Bleſſed of my Father!</hi> 1. To point out the Fontal Cauſe of all our Happineſs, the Love of the Father. <hi>This prepared the Kingdom.</hi> 2. This Expreſſion ſhews how the Divine Perſons glorifie one another. As the Spirit glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the Son, ſo the Son glorifies the Father, and referrs all to him. Therefore Chriſt ſays not, <hi>Come my redeemed ones,</hi> but, <hi>Come ye bleſled ones;</hi> not, <hi>Come you that were redeemed by me,</hi> but, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fathee;</hi> 'tis <hi>his good Pleaſure to give you the Kingdom. Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his ſecond Coming will adjudge all his People unto a State of glorious and everlaſting Happineſs, which his Father has prepared, and himſelf has purchaſed for them. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in: 36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour ſets forth, not the meritorious Cauſe of his Saint's Happineſs, but the infallible Signs of ſuch as ſhould inherit that Happineſs; the Character of the Perſons that might expect it. Such as fed him, clothed and viſited him in his Members. Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the Godly having their Sins forgiven in this World, probably there ſhall be no mention made of them in the Day of Judgment. Chriſt here only mentions the good Works of his Saints; <hi>Ye fed me, ye clothed,</hi> not a Word of their Failings. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That they are not the Duties of the firſt, but of the ſecond Table, which here Chriſt mentions, becauſe Works of Charity are more viſible to the World than Works of Piety. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That at the great Day every Man's Sentence ſhall be pronounced according to his Works. 2. That Works of Charity done out of Love to Chriſt, ſhall be particularly obſerved, and bountifully rewarded by Chriſt at the great Day. The Queſtion then will be, not how have you Heard, Pray'd, or Preach'd, but whom have you Fed, Cloathed, and Viſited. 3. That whatever Good or Evil is done to the poor Members of Chriſt, Chriſt reckons it as done unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me Meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37 Then ſhall the righteous anſwer him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſaw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? 38 When
<pb facs="tcp:46556:39"/> ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 39 Or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in priſon, and came unto thee? 40 And the King ſhall anſwer, and ſay unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
               <p>Here we have a Dialogue or interchangeable Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his faithful Servants at the great Day; where <hi>Obſerve</hi> their Queſtion, and his Reply. Their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Lord, when did we feed thee, cloath, or viſit thee?</hi> We have forgot the Time, tho' ſuch is thy Goodneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Chriſt keeps a faithful Record of all our Acts of pious Charity, when we have forgotten them. If we remember to do Good, Chriſt will be ſure to remember the Good we have done. Ay, and reward it as well as remember it: Again, this Queſtion of theirs may proceed from Admiration and Wonder, and from an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senſe of their own Nothingneſs, and from the Greatneſs of Chriſt's Condeſcenſion, in taking notice of ſuch mean Services, and requiting them with ſuch a Tranſcendent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That when Chriſt comes to reward his Children and People, they will wonder and be aſtoniſhed at the Poverty and Meanneſs of their own Services, and at the Tranſcendency and Greatneſs of his Rewards. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, Our Lord's Reply, <hi>Inaſmuch as ye did it to the least of theſe of my Brethren, ye did it unto me.</hi> Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Title put by Jeſus Chriſt upon his pooreſt and meaneſt Members, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> 2. The Reſentment of the Kindneſs ſhewed to his Brethren, <hi>as ſhewn unto himſelf; Inaſmuch as ye did it to them, ye have done it to me. Learn thence,</hi> That ſuch is the indearing Intimacy betwixt Chriſt and his Members, that whatever is done to any of them, is eſteem'd by him as done unto himſelf.</p>
               <p n="41">41 Their ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>
               <p>Here we have the Sentence of Condemnation denounced againſt the Wicked. Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Poſture in which they are found <hi>at Chriſt's Left Hand.</hi> This doth not ſo much denote the Ignominy of the Place, (tho' placing at the Left Hand is leſs honourable) as the Impiety of their Choice they took up with left-hand Mercies, the Mercies of the Footſtool, Wealth and Riches, Dignity and Honour. As for the good Things, <hi>which are at God's Right Hand for evermore,</hi> they never ſought after theſe. Verily, a Man may know his future State by his preſent Choice. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to wicked Men, <hi>Ye curſed.</hi> Not curſed of my Father, becauſe curſing is God's ſtrange Work. We force him to it, he delights not in it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Sentence it ſelf. Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The Puniſhment of Loſs, <hi>Depart from me. Learn thence,</hi> That it is the Hell of Hell to the damned, that they muſt everlaſtingly depart from, and loſe the comfortable Fruition and Enjoyment of God in Chriſt. 'Tis to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of an infinite Good. Hell is a deep Dungeon, where the Sunſhine of God's Preſence never cometh. 2. The Puniſhment of Senſe, <hi>Depart into everlaſting Fire.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> Its Severity, 'tis <hi>Fire,</hi> its Eternity, it is <hi>everlaſting Fire. Learn thence,</hi> That there are everlaſting Torments in Hell prepared for the Wicked; there is a State of Torment, and a Place of Torment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by God. All Princes have not only their Palace, but their Priſon. God has the Palace of Heaven, for Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, and his Friends; and the Priſon of Hell for the puniſhing his Enemies. The Nature of the damned's Miſery is ſet out by <hi>Fire,</hi> and the whole Man, Body and Soul, ſhall be tormented in it. 1. The Body, in all its Members; their Eyes with affrighting Spectacles, <hi>the Devil and his Angels,</hi> and their old Companions in Sin, every time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe, it revives their Guilt, and enrages their Deſpair. Their Ears are filled with Yellings and Howlings, and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Outcries. 2. The Soul ſhall ſuffer in Hell, by reflecting upon its own Choice, by remembring Time ſinfully waſted, Seaſons of Grace ſadly ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ighted, the Mercies of God unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily abuſed. Lord, how will the Remembrance of paſt Mercies aggravate preſent Miſeries.</p>
               <p n="42">42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave no drink: 43 I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: ſick, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ye viſited me not. 44 Then ſhall they alſo anſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, or a thirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee? 45 Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How Chriſt lays the Charge of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed's Damnation upon themſelves alone. <hi>You gave me no Meat, you took me not in.</hi> Man, and Man alone is the Cauſe of his own Deſtruction and Damnation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Kind of Sin charged on the Wicked at the great Day. Conſider it 1. In its generical Nature; 'tis a Sin of Omiſſion. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That Sins of Omiſſion are certainly damning, as well as Sins of Commiſſion. Conſider it, 2. In its ſpecifical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 'tis a Sin of Unmercifulneſs, or Want of Love to Chriſt and his Members. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That one reigning Sin, one prevailing Corruption, is enough to damn a Perſon, becauſe it deprives a Man of the Grace of the Goſpel, and excludes him from all the Benefit of the Promiſes. <hi>Note, Lastly,</hi> If ſuch as do not give to Chriſt in his Members ſhall be miſerable at the great Day, what will the Condition of them be that take from them, who ſtrip and ſtarve them, who perſecute and hate them? Who impriſon or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them? If the Uncharitable ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved, yea, ſhall certainly be damned, where ſhall the Unmerciful and Cruel appear?</p>
               <p n="46">46 And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That tho' the Righteous are firſt judged, yet the Sentence is firſt executed on the Wicked. <hi>Theſe ſhall go into everlaſting Puniſhment. Obſ.</hi> 2. That Men's States and Conditions in another World will be different, as their Ways and Doings have been in this World. 3. That everlaſting Life ſhall be the Portion of the Godly, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment the Portion of the Wicked. God grant that the Horrors of eternal Darkneſs, and the diſmal Thoughts of a miſerable Eternity, may effectually diſcourage every one of us from a wicked and impenitent Courſe of Life; <hi>for who can dwell with the devouring Fire? Who can dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings?</hi>

               <p n="1">1 AND it came to paſs, when Jeſus had finiſhed all theſe ſayings, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his diſciples, 2 Ye know that after two days is the feaſt of the paſſeover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. 3 Then aſſembled together the chief prieſts, and the ſcribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high prieſt, who was called Caiaphas, 4 And conſulted that they might take Jeſus by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and kill him. 5 But they ſaid, Not on the feaſt <hi>day,</hi> leſt there be an uproar among the people.</p>
               <p>Several things are here <hi>Obſerveable;</hi> as 1. The Perſons conſpiring againſt our bleſſed Redeemer's Life, namely, the <hi>chief Priests, Scribes, and Elders,</hi> that is, the whole <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> or general Council: Theſe lay their malicious Heads together, to contrive the Deſtruction of the innocent Jeſus. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That general Councils have erred, and may err. Here was a general Council, conſiſting of <hi>Prieſts, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> with the <hi>High Priest</hi> their Preſident, yet erring in a Point of Doctrine concerning the Meſſiah, not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus to be the Son of God, notwithſtanding all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb facs="tcp:46556:40"/> Miracles which he had wrought before them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The manner of this Conſpiracy againſt our Saviour's Life; it was clandeſtine, ſecret, and ſubtil, <hi>they conſulted how they might take him by Subtilty, and kill him. Learn thence,</hi> That Satan makes uſe of the Subtilty of crafty Men, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their Parts as well as their Power, for his own Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Satan never ſends a Fool of his Errand. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Time when this Conſpiracy was managed, <hi>at the Time of the Paſſover.</hi> Indeed at firſt the chief Prieſts did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to that time, <hi>fearing a Tumult and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>proar among the People;</hi> but <hi>Judas</hi> preſenting them with a fair Opportunity to apprehend him, they changed their Purpoſe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly at the Feaſt of the Paſſover our Saviour ſuffered. This was not without a Myſtery, that Chriſt the true Lamb of God, whom the Paſchal Lamb typified and repreſented, ſhould be offered up at <hi>the Feaſt of the Paſſover.</hi> Signifying thereby, that he was the true Paſchal Lamb, and that the Legal Shadow ought to ceaſe in the Exhibition of him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That not only the Death of Chriſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but all the Circumſtances relating to it, were fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God himſelf, as the Place where, <hi>at Jeruſalem;</hi> the Time when, <hi>at the Feaſt of the Paſſover;</hi> that Time did God deviſe beſt for this Lamb to be a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Now when Jeſus was in Bethany in the houſe of Simon the leper, 7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaſter box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he ſat at <hi>meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Woman St. <hi>John</hi> ſays was <hi>Mary,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who, to ſhew her Love to Chriſt, and put Honour upon him, took a precious Box of Ointment, and poured it upon our Saviour's Head, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Eaſtern Countries,</hi> who uſed ſo to do at their Feaſts and Banquets, to which <hi>David</hi> alludes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That where true Love to Chriſt prevails in the Heart, nothing is adjudged too dear for Chriſt. This Box of Ointment mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring <hi>Judas</hi> valued at 300 Pence; which reckoning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Penny at Seven Pence Halfpenny, makes of our Money Nine Pounds Seven Shillings and Six Pence. Love (we ſee) ſpares for no Coſt, but where the Eſteem of Chriſt is high, the Affection will be ſtrong. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That where ſtrong Love prevails towards Jeſus Chriſt, it ſuffers not it ſelf to be outſhined by any Examples. The weakeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſtrongly loves Jeſus Chriſt, will piouſly ſtrive with the greateſt Apoſtle to expreſs the Fervour of her Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. I do not find any of the Apoſtles at thus much Coſt to put Honour upon Chriſt, that this poor Woman was at. Love knows no Bounds, no Meaſures.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But when his diſciples ſaw it, they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ſaying, To what purpoſe <hi>is</hi> this waſte? 9 For this ointment might have been ſold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
               <p>That is, when <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſome other Diſciples, whom he had influenced, ſaw this Action, they murmured; particularly <hi>Judas</hi> blamed this holy Woman for needleſs Prodigality, and did tacitly reflect upon Chriſt himſelf, for ſuffering that waſteful Expence. Oh how doth a covetous Heart think every thing too good for Chriſt! He that ſees a pious Action well done, and ſeeks to undervalue it, ſhews himſelf poſſeſs'd with a Spirit of Envy. <hi>Judas</hi> his invidious Spirit makes him cenſure an Action, which Chriſt highly approved. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Men who know not our Hearts, may, thro' Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or Prejudice, cenſure and condemn thoſe Actions, which God doth commend, and will graciouſly reward. Happy for this poor Woman, that ſhe had a more righteous Judge to paſs Sentence upon her Action than wicked <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 When Jeſus underſtood it, he ſaid unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for ſhe hath wrought a good work upon me. 11 For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always. 12 For in that ſhe hath poured this ointment on my body, ſhe did it for my burial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How readily our Lord vindicates this good Woman: She ſays nothing for her ſelf, nor need ſhe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch an Advocate. 1. Chriſt rebukes <hi>Judas; why trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ye the Woman?</hi> Plainly intimating that it is no ſmall Trouble to a Gracious Spirit to find their good Works miſinterpreted and miſrepreſented; next, he defends the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, calling it a good Work; becauſe done out of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Love to Chriſt, <hi>ſhe hath wrought a good Work upon me.</hi> And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He gives the Reaſon of her Action, <hi>ſhe did it for my Burial.</hi> As Kings and great Perſons were wont in thoſe <hi>Eaſtern Countries</hi> at their Funerals to be embalm'd with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and ſweet Perfumes: So, ſays our Saviour, this Woman, to declare her Faith in me, as her King and Lord, doth with this Box of Ointment, as it were beforehand, embalm my Body for its Burial. True Faith puts Honour upon a crucified, as well as a glorified Saviour. This holy Woman accounts Chriſt worthy of all honour in his Death, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would be a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice unto God, and the ſavour of Life unto his People.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Verily I ſay unto you, Whereſoever this goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole world, there ſhall alſo this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having defended this holy Woman from the Calumny of <hi>Judas</hi> in the foregoing Verſes, in this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that ſhe ſhould be rewarded with an honourable Memorial in all Ages of the Church. <hi>Where ever the Goſpel is preached, this ſhall be ſpoken of her.</hi> Oh what Care doth Chriſt take to have the good Deeds of his Children not buried in the Duſt with them, but be had <hi>in everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi> Tho' Sin cauſes Men to rot above Ground, to ſtink alive; and when they are dead leaves an inglorious Memory upon their Graves, yet will the Actions of the Juſt ſmell ſweet, and bloſſom in the Duſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, went unto the chief prieſts, 15 And ſaid unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of ſilver. 16 And from that time he ſought opportunity to betray him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Perſon betraying our Bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Judas: Judas,</hi> a Profeſſor; <hi>Judas,</hi> a Preacher; <hi>Judas,</hi> an Apoſtle, and <hi>one of the Twelve,</hi> whom Chriſt had choſen out of all the World, to be his deareſt Friends, and his own Family and Houſhold. Shall <hi>we wonder</hi> to find Friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly or unfaithful towards us, when our Saviour had a Traitor in his own Houſe? <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Heinouſneſs of his Sin, in betraying Chriſt: He betrayed Chriſt Jeſus, a Man; Chriſt Jeſus, his Maſter; Chriſt Jeſus, his Maker; the firſt was Murther, the ſecond Treaſon. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is no ſtrange or uncommon thing, for the vileſt of Sins, and moſt horrid Impieties, to be acted by ſuch Perſons, as make the moſt eminent Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſion of Holineſs and Religion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. What was the Sin occaſioning and leading <hi>Judas</hi> to the committing of this horrid Sin. It was Covetouſneſs. I do not find that <hi>Judas</hi> had any particular Malice againſt Chriſt's Perſon, but a baſe and unworthy Spirit of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs poſſeſs'd him; this made him ſell his Maſter. Covetouſneſs is the Root-Sin, an inordinate Deſire and Love of Riches, an eager and unſatiable Thirſt after the World, is the Parent of the moſt monſtrous and unnatural Sins: Therefore remember we our Saviour's Caution, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. <hi>Take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſs;</hi> he doubles the Caution, to ſhew us both the great Danger of the Sin, and the great Care we ought to take to preſerve our ſelves from it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. How ſmall a Sum tempted the covetous Mind of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter, <hi>Thirty Pieces of Silver;</hi> which amounted but to Three Pounds and Fifteen Shillings of our Money. This was the Price of a Slave or common Servant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. as Chriſt took upon him the Form of a Servant, ſo his Life was valued at the rate of an ordinary Servant's Life. It may ſeem a wonder, that the High Prieſts ſhould offer no more for the Life of our Saviour, and that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould accept ſo little. But the Wiſdom of God over-ruled this Matter, for fulfilling that Prophecy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12. <hi>They weighed for my Price Thirty Pieces of Silver.</hi> Let not any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be concerned, that he is deſpiſed and undervalued;
<pb facs="tcp:46556:40"/> he can never meet with ſo great a Reproach, ſo low an Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Chriſt, as Chriſt underwent for him. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly, Judas</hi> his Folly, as well as his Treachery; he that might have demanded what he pleaſed for this Purchaſe, <hi>he ſays unto the chief Prieſts, What will ye give me?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I am reſolved to ſell him at any rate, give me what you will for him. Nay, farther, <hi>Judas</hi> covenanted, and they promiſed, but whether it was now paid, appeareth not. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch a Perſon as has a vile and baſe Eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt, will part with him upon any Terms. The bare Expectation of a few Sheckles of Silver will make ſuch a one willing to part with the Pearl of great Price.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now the firſt day of the feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread the diſciples came to Jeſus, ſaying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the paſſover? 18 And he ſaid, Go into the city to ſuch a man, and ſay unto him, The maſter ſaith, My time is at hand, I will keep the paſſover at thy houſe with my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. 19 And the diſciples did as Jeſus had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, and they made ready the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>The Time for the Celebration of the Paſſover being now at Hand, Chriſt ſends Two of his Diſciples to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to prepare things neceſſary, in order thereunto: Accordingly they enter the City, and find the Maſter of an Houſe, whoſe Heart Chriſt, by his Divine Power, had ſo inclined, that he willingly accommodated them upon this Occaſion. Our Bleſſed Saviour had not a Lamb of his own, and poſſibly no Money in his Purſe to buy one, but he finds as excellent Accommodations in this poor Man's Houſe, as if he had dwelt in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Ivory Palace, and had had the Proviſions of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Table. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt has ſuch an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon, and Command over the Spirits of Men, that he can incline them to do what Service ſoever he pleaſeth for him. When Chriſt has a Paſſover to celebrate, he will prepare an Houſe, and diſpoſe the Heart to a free Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That Chriſt being under the Law, obſerves and keeps the Law of the Paſſover. Thus he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all Righteouſneſs; and altho' the Ceremonial Law was to receive its Aboliſhment in the Death of Chriſt, yet all the time of his Life he punctually obſerved it.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Now when the even was come, he ſat down with the twelve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Impudent Forehead of this bold Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> who preſumed as ſoon as he had ſold his Maſter, to ſit down at the Table with him, and partake with the other Diſciples of the ſolemn Ordinance of the Paſſover; had the Preſence of <hi>Judas</hi> polluted the Ordinance to any beſides himſelf, doubtleſs our Saviour would never have permitted his bold Intruſion. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That nothing is more ordinary than for unholy Perſons preſumptuouſly to ruſh in upon the ſolemn Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, which they have no Right, whilſt ſuch, to partake of. 2. That the Preſence of ſuch Perſons pollutes the Ordinances only to themſelves, holy Perſons are not polluted by the Sins of ſuch. <hi>For to the Pure all things are Pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 And as they did eat, he ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, that one of you ſhall betray me.</p>
               <p>What an aſtoniſhing Word was this? One of you my Diſciples ſhall betray me. Can any Church on Earth expect Purity in all its Members, when Chriſt's own Family of Twelve had a Traitor and a Devil in it. Yet tho' it was very ſad to hear that one ſhould betray him, it was Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Joy that it was but One; One Hypocrite in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is too much, but there is cauſe of rejoicing if there be no more. But why did not Chriſt name <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſay, Thou art he that ſhalt betray me? Doubtleſs to draw him to Repentance, and to prevent giving <hi>Judas</hi> any Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lord, how ſad is it for ſuch as pretend Friendſhip to Chriſt, and call themſelves of his Family and Acquaintance, <hi>who eat of his Bread, and yet lift up the Heel againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 And they were exceeding ſorrowful, and began every one of them to ſay unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Diſciples Sorrow, and next the Effect of that Sorrow. Their Sorrow was (as well it might) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great. Well might innocent Diſciples be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Sorrow, to hear that their Maſter ſhould dye; that he ſhould dye by Treaſon, that the Traitor ſhould be one of themſelves. But tho' their Sorrow was great, yet was the Effect of their Sorrow very good; it wrought in them an holy Suſpicion of themſelves, and cauſed every one to ſearch himſelf, and ſay, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is poſſible for ſuch ſecret Wickedneſs to lurk in our Hearts as we never ſuſpected, which Time and Temptation may draw forth in ſuch a manner, as we could not believe; and therefore it is both wiſe and holy to ſuſpect our ſelves, and be often ſaying, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> There is no better Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative from Sin, than to be jealous over our ſelves with a godly Jealouſie. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, That tho' the Diſciples Fear and Sorrow made them jealous and ſuſpicious, yet was it of themſelves, not of one another; nay, not of <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf. Every one ſaid, <hi>Master, is it I?</hi> Not <hi>Maſter, is it Judas? Learn hence,</hi> That true Sincerity and Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will make us more ſuſpicious of our ſelves than of any other Perſon whatſoever. It always hopes the beſt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and fears the worſt concerning our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And he anſwered and ſaid, He that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his hand with me in the diſh, the ſame ſhall betray me. 24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but wo unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had not been born. 25 Then Judas which betrayed him, anſwered, and ſaid, Maſter, is it I? He ſaid unto him, Thou haſt ſaid.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour acquaints his Diſciples who it was that had deſigned his Death, even he that dipped with him in the Diſh, or he to whom he gave the Sop. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The Traitor whom Chriſt leſs loved, he has the Sop given to him; the other Diſciples, whom Chriſt lov'd better, had no ſuch particular Boon. Outward good Things are not always given to the Children of Men in Love, but are ſometimes beſtowed in Diſpleaſure; there is no meaſuring Chriſt's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by Temporal Bleſſings, no concluding either Love or Hatred by theſe things. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> how <hi>Judas</hi> could ſit ſtill, and hear the Threats of Judgment denounced againſt himſelf without Concern; he hears Chriſt ſay, <hi>Wo to the Man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed,</hi> and is no more blank'd than Innocence it ſelf: Reſolved Sinners run on deſperately in their wicked Courſes, and with open Eyes, ſee and meet their own Deſtruction, and are neither diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, nor concerned about it. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> That this ſhameleſs Man had the Impudence to ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> Our Saviour gives him a direct Affirmation, <hi>Thou hast ſaid.</hi> Did not <hi>Judas</hi> (think we) bluſh, and caſt down his guilty Eyes, and let fall his dro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Eternal Miſery is much worſe than Non-Entity. <hi>It had been better for</hi> Judas <hi>he had not been born,</hi> than to commit ſuch a Sin, and lye under ſuch Wrath, and that everlaſting. Oh better to have no Being, than not to have a Being in Chriſt!</p>
               <p n="26">26 And as they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my body. 27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it: 28 For this is my blood of the new teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:41"/> 29 But I ſay unto you, I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. 30 And, when they had ſung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Celebration of the Paſſover follows the Inſtitution of the Lord's Supper. In which <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Author of this new Sacrament. <hi>Jeſus took Bread. Note thence,</hi> That to inſtitute a Sacrament is Chriſt's ſole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; it is the Churches Duty to celebrate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſhe has Power to make none. This belongs only to Chriſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 2. The Time of the Inſtitution, the Night before his Paſſion. <hi>The Night before he was betrayed, Jeſus took Bread. Learn thence,</hi> That it is very neceſſary when Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are approaching to have Recourſe to the Table of the Lord, which affords both an Antidote againſt Fear, and is Reſtorative to Faith. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 3. The Sacramental E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, <hi>Bread and Wine. Bread,</hi> repreſenting his Body; and <hi>Wine,</hi> his Blood. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 4. The Miniſterial Actions, <hi>the Breaking of the Bread,</hi> and <hi>the Bleſſing of the Cup.</hi> As to the Bread, <hi>Jeſus took it;</hi> that is, ſet it apart from common Uſe, and ſeparated it for Holy Ends and Purpoſes. <hi>He bleſſed it;</hi> that is, prayed for a Bleſſing upon it; <hi>and brake it,</hi> thereby ſhadowing forth his Body broken upon the Croſs. And <hi>he gave it to his Diſciples,</hi> ſaving, This broken Bread ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies my Body ſuddenly to be broken upon the Croſs for your Redemption and Salvation. <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> and of my Death. As to the Cup, Chriſt having ſet it apart by Prayer and Thankſgiving, he commands his Diſciples <hi>to drink all of it,</hi> and ſubjoins a Reaſon for it; For <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> That is, The Wine in this Cup repreſents the ſhedding of my Blood, by which the new Covenant betwixt God and Man was ratified and confirmed. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That every Communicant has an undoubted Right to the Cup, as to the Bread in the Lord's Supper. <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> ſays Chriſt; therefore to deny the Cup to the Laity is contrary to the Inſtitution of Chriſt. After the Celebration was over, our Saviour and his Diſciples ſang an Hymn, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do at the Paſſover, the Six Euchariſtical Pſalms, from 113th to the 119th <hi>Pſalm. Learn hence,</hi> How fit it is that God be glorified in his Church, by ſinging of Pſalms, and in particular, when the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is celebrated. <hi>When they had ſung an Hymn, they went unto the Mount of</hi> Olives.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Then ſaith Jeſus unto them, All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night: for it is written, I will ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour acquaints his Diſciples, that by reaſon of his approaching Sufferings, they ſhould all of them be ſo exceedingly offended with him, that they would certainly forſake and leave him; which accordingly came to paſs. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Chriſt's deareſt Freinds forſook him, and left him alone in the midſt of his greateſt Diſtreſs and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. What was the Cauſe of this their Flight, it was the Prevalency of their Fear. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> How ſad it is for the holieſt and beſt of Men to be left under the Power of their own Fears in a Day of Temptation.</p>
               <p n="32">32 But after I am riſen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The wonderful Lenity of Chriſt towards his timerous and fearful Diſciples; notwithſtanding their coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flight from him, he tells them he would not forſake them, but love them ſtill; and as an Evidence of it, would meet them in <hi>Galilee: I will go before you into</hi> Galilee, <hi>there ſhall you ſee me.</hi> And when they did ſee him, he never upbraided them with their Timerouſneſs, but was Friends with them, notwithſtanding their late Cowardice. Chriſt's Love to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is like himſelf, unchangeable and everlaſting. <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them unto the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33 Peter anſwered and ſaid unto him, Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended. 34 Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily I ſay unto thee, That this night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. 35 Peter ſaid unto him, Though I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewiſe alſo ſaid all the diſciples.</p>
               <p>See here what ſtrong Purpoſes and ſettled Reſolutions, both <hi>Peter</hi> and all the Apoſtles had to keep cloſe to Chriſt; but how did their Self-confidence fail them? <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Self-confidence is a Sin, too too incident to the holieſt and beſt of Men. <hi>Tho' all Men forſake thee, yet will not I.</hi> Good Man, he reſolved honeſtly, but too too much in his own Strength. Little, little did he think what a Feather he ſhould be in the Wind of Temptation, if once God left him to the Power and Prevalency of his own Fears. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve farther,</hi> That the Reſt of the Apoſtles had the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Opinion of their own Strength with St. <hi>Peter. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo ſaid they all. Note thence,</hi> That the holieſt of Men know not their own Strength till it comes to the Trial. Little did theſe good Men imagine what a cowardly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they had in them, till Temptation put it to the Proof.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Then cometh Jeſus with them unto a place called Gethſemane, and ſaith unto the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 37 And he took with him, Peter, and the two ſons of Zebedee, and began to be ſorrowful, and very heavy. 38 Then ſaith he unto them, My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. 39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this cup paſs from me: nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt. 40 And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the diſciples, and findeth them aſleep, and ſaith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak. 42 He went away again the ſecond time, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup may not paſs away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 43 And he came, and found them aſleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, ſaying the ſame words.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being now come with his Diſciples into the Garden, he falls there into a bitter and bloody Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which he prayed with wonderful Fervency and Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to his Heavenly Father. His Sufferings were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a great pace, and he meets them upon his Knees, and would be found in a praying Poſture. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Prayer is the beſt Preparative for, as well as the moſt powerful Support under the heavieſt Sufferings that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us. As to this Prayer of our Saviour's in the Garden, many things are very <hi>Obſervable.</hi> As 1. The Place where he prayed, <hi>In the Garden;</hi> but why went Chriſt thither? Was it to hide or ſhelter himſelf from his Enemies? Nothing leſs; for if ſo, it had been the moſt improper Place, becauſe he was wont to retire thither to pray. <hi>John</hi> 18.2. Judas <hi>knew the Place, for Jeſus oft-times reſorted thither;</hi> ſo that Chriſt went thither, not to ſhun, but to prepare himſelf by Prayer to meet his Enemies. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The time when he enter'd the Garden for Prayer, it was in the Evening; here he ſpent ſome Hours in pouring out his Soul to God; for about Midnight <hi>Judas</hi> and the Soldiers came, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him in a praying Poſture. <hi>Teaching</hi> us by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that when eminent Dangers are before us, eſpecially, when Death is apprehended by us, to be very much in Prayer to God, and very fervent in our Wreſtlings with him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Matter of our Lord's Prayer, <hi>that if poſſible the Cup might paſs from him.</hi> That is, thoſe bitter Sufferings which were then before him; particularly the inſupportable Burthen of his Father's Wrath. <hi>He prays, if poſſible that his Father would</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:41"/> excuſe him from this dreadful Wrath, his Soul being amaz'd at it. But what! Did Chriſt then begin to repent of his Undertaking for Sinners? Did he ſhrink and give back when it came to the Pinch? No, no, as Chriſt had Two Natures, being God and Man, ſo he had Two diſtinct Wills; as Man he feared and ſhunned Death, as God-man he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmitted to it; the Divine Spirit, and the Humane Nature of Chriſt did now aſſault each other with diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intereſts, till at laſt Victory was got on the Spirit's ſide. Again, This Prayer was not abſolute, but conditional, <hi>If it be poſſible. Father,</hi> it may be, if thou art willing, if it pleaſe thee, <hi>let it paſs;</hi> if not, I will drink it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Cup of Sufferings is in it ſelf conſidered a very bitter and diſtaſteful Cup, which Humane Nature abhorrs, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire and pray may paſs from it. 2. That yet oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Wiſdom of God is pleaſed to put this bitter Cup of Affliction into the Hands of thoſe whom he doth moſt ſincerely love. 3. That when God doth ſo, it is their Duty to drink it with humble Submiſſion, and chearful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done. Obſ.</hi> 4. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how our Lord prayed; and here we ſhall find it, 1. A ſolitary Prayer, he went by himſelf alone, out of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Diſciples; he ſaid to them, <hi>Tarry ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</hi> Mark, Chriſt did neither deſire his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to pray with him, or to pray for him. No, he muſt tread the Wine-preſs alone; not but that Chriſt loved and delighted in his Diſciples Company, but there were Occaſions when he thought fit to leave them, and to go alone to God in Prayer. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That the Company of our beſt Friends is not always ſeaſonable. <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were Three good Men, but Chriſt bids them tarry, while he went aſide for private Prayer. There are Times and Caſes when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian would not be willing that the deareſt Friend he has in the World ſhould be with him, or underſtand and hear what paſſes betwixt him and his God. 2. This Prayer of Chriſt was an humble Prayer; that's evident by the Poſtures into which he caſt himſelf; ſometimes <hi>Kneeling,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Lying proſtrate upon his Face.</hi> He lyes in the very Duſt; lower he cannot fall; and his Heart was as low as his Body. And ſuch was the Fervour of his Spirit, that he prayed himſelf into an Agony. Oh let us bluſh to think how unlike we are to Chriſt in Prayer, as to our praying Frame of Spirit! Lord, what Drowſineſs and Deadneſs? What Lazineſs and Dulneſs? What Stupidity and Formality is found in our Prayers? How often do our Lips move, and our Hearts ſtand ſtill? 3. It was a repeated and reiterated Prayer. <hi>He prayed the firſt, ſecond, and third time.</hi> He returns upon God over and over, plies him again and again, reſolving to take no Denial. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Chriſtians ought not to be diſcouraged, tho' they have ſought God again and again for a particular Mercy, and no Anſwer of Prayer has come unto them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> alſo, How our Lord uſed the ſame Prayer three times over, <hi>ſaying the ſame Words.</hi> A Perſon then may pray with, and by a Form of Prayer, and yet not pray for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, but in a very acceptable manner unto God. Chriſt both gave a Form of Prayer to his Diſciples, and alſo uſed one himſelf. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, The Poſture in which our holy Lord found his own Diſciples, when he was in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>they were ſleeping,</hi> when he was praying. Oh wonderful! that they could ſleep at ſuch a time. <hi>Hence we gather,</hi> That the beſt of Chriſt's Diſciples may be ſometimes overtaken with Infirmities, with great Infirmities, when the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Duties are performing. <hi>He cometh to his Diſciples, and finds them ſleeping. Obſerve</hi> next, The gentle Reproof he gave the Diſciples for ſleeping; <hi>What, could you not watch with me one Hour?</hi> Could you not watch, when your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is in ſuch Danger? Could you not watch with me, when I am going to deliver up my Life for you? What, not one Hour, and that the parting Hour too! After his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion he ſubjoins an Exhortation; <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation;</hi> and ſuperadds a forcible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>For tho' the Spirit be willing, yet the Fleſh is weak. Thence Learn,</hi> That the holieſt and beſt reſolved Chriſtians, who have willing Spirits for Chriſt and his Service, yet in regard of the Weakneſs of the Fleſh, or the Frailty of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is their Duty to watch and pray, and thereby guard themſelves againſt Temptations. <hi>Watch and pray,—for tho' the Spirit is willing, yet</hi>—</p>
               <p n="45">45 Then cometh he to his diſciples, and ſaith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your reſt; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of ſinners. 46 Riſe, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. 47 And while he yet ſpake, lo, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with ſwords and ſtaves from the chief prieſts, and elders of the people. 48 Now he that betrayed him, gave them a ſign, ſaying, Whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, that ſame is he, hold him faſt. 49 And forthwith he came to Jeſus, and ſaid Hail Maſter; and kiſſed him. 50 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they and laid hands on Jeſus, and took him.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having pour'd out his Soul in Prayer to God in the Garden, he is now ready, and waits for the coming of his Enemies, being firſt in the Field: Accordingly, <hi>While he yet ſpake, came</hi> Judas, <hi>one of the Twelve,</hi> and under his Conduct a Band of Soldiers to apprehend him. It was the Lot and Portion of our Bleſſed Redeemer to be betrayed into the Hands of his mortal Enemies by the Treachery of a falſe and diſſembling Friend. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Treaſon, the Manner how, and the Time when this treaſonable Deſign was executed. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Betrayer, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> all the Evangeliſts carefully deſcribe him by his Name, <hi>Judas,</hi> by his Sirname, <hi>Iſcariot,</hi> leſt he ſhould be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken for <hi>Jude</hi> the Brother of <hi>James.</hi> God is tender of the Names and Reputations of his upright-hearted Servants. He is alſo deſcribed by his Office, <hi>One of the Twelve.</hi> The Eminence of his Place and Station was an high Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Tranſgreſſion. Nay, in ſome reſpect he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred above the reſt, having a peculiar Truſt repoſed in him, he bare the Bag: That is, he was Almoner, and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Chriſt's Family, to take Care for the neceſſary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and yet this Man, thus called, thus honoured, thus reſpectfully treated by Chriſt, for the Lucre of a little Money, perfidiouſly betrays him. Oh, whither will not a bad Heart, and a buſie Devil carry a Man? <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the greateſt Profeſſors had need be jealous of their own Hearts, and look well to the Grounds and Principles of their Profeſſion. A Profeſſion begun in Hypocriſie will certainly end in Apoſtacy. <hi>Learn</hi> 2. That Perſons are never in ſuch eminent Danger, as when they meet with Temptations exactly ſuited to their Maſter-Luſts. Covetouſneſs was <hi>Judas</hi>'s Maſter-Sin; the Love of the World made him a Slave to Satan, and the Devil lays a Temptation before him, which ſuits his Temper, hits his Humour, and it prevails immediately. Oh pray, pray that ye may be kept from a ſtrong and ſuitable Temptation, a Temptation ſuited to your predominant Luſt and Inclination. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. As the Betrayer <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo the Treaſon it ſelf with its aggravating Circumſtances; he led an armed Multitude to the Place where Chriſt was, gave them a Signal to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, and encouraged them to lay Hands upon him, and <hi>hold him fast.</hi> This was the helliſh Deſign Satan put into his Heart, and it has theſe aggravating Circumſtances attending it. He had ſeen the Miracles which Chriſt wrought by the Power of God, and could not but know him to be a Divine Perſon. He could not ſin out of Ignorance or blind Zeal, but the Love of Money made him do what he did. Farther, what he did was not done by the Perſwaſions of any, but he was a Voluntier in this Service. The High Prieſts neither ſent to him, nor ſent for him, but he offers his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and no doubt they were very much ſurprized to find one of Chriſt's own Diſciples at the Head of a Conſpiracy againſt him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That no Man knows where he ſhall ſtop or ſtand when he firſt enters the Ways of Sin; ſhould any one have told <hi>Judas</hi> that his Love of Money would at laſt ſo far prevail upon him, as to make him ſell the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, he would have anſwered as <hi>Haſael</hi> did <hi>Eliſha. Is thy Servant a Dog, that I ſhould do this thing?</hi> Wickedneſs like Holineſs doth not preſently come to its full Strength in the Soul, but grows up by inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The manner how this helliſh Plot was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; partly by Force, and partly by Fraud; by Force, in that he came <hi>with a Multitude, armed with Swords and Staves;</hi> and by Fraud he <hi>gives him a Kiſs, and ſays, Hail, Maſter.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:42"/> Here was Honey in the Tongue, and Poyſon in the Heart. <hi>Learn</hi> we hence, To beware of Men; when we ſee too too glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Appearances, we may ſuſpect the inſide. Charity for others is our Duty, but too great Confidence may be our Snare. There is ſo much Hypocriſie in many, and ſo much Corruption in all, that we muſt not be too confident. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The time when this treaſonable Deſign was executed upon Chriſt; when he was in the Garden with his Diſciples, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to Prayer and Watchfulneſs, dropping Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and moſt ſeaſonable Counſels upon them. <hi>While he yet ſpake, lo,</hi> Judas <hi>came, and the Multitude with him. Judas</hi> found Chriſt in the moſt heavenly and excellent Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he came to apprehend him. Oh how happy is it, when our Sufferings find us in God's Way, engaged in his Service, and engaging his Aſſiſtance by fervent Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus did our Lord's Sufferings meet him, may they ſo meet us.</p>
               <p n="51">51 And behold, one of them which were with Jeſus, ſtretched out his hand, and drew his ſword, and ſtroke a ſervant of the high prieſts, and ſmote off his ear. 52 Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Put up again thy ſword into his Place: for all they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword. 53 Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve legions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? 54 But how then ſhall the ſcriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</p>
               <p>The rude Multitude laying Hands upon Chriſt, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples who had remitted their Watch, do reſume their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and are willing to reſcue their Maſter if they can; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Peter</hi> draws his Sword, and cuts off the Ear of <hi>Malchus,</hi> one of the forwardeſt to lay hold on Jeſus. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Zeal and ſincere Love for his Lord and Maſter; it was in great Sincerity ſpoken, <hi>Tho' I dye with thee, I will not deny thee.</hi> But why did not St. <hi>Peter</hi> draw his Sword upon <hi>Judas,</hi> rather than <hi>Malchus?</hi> Perhaps becauſe tho' <hi>Judas</hi> was more faulty, yet <hi>Malchus</hi> was more forward to arreſt and carry off our Saviour. How doth a pious Breaſt ſwell with Indignation at the Sight of any open Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front offered unto Chriſt. <hi>Obſerve further,</hi> That tho' St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Heart was ſincere, yet his Hand was raſh: Good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are no Warrant for irregular Actions, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt, who accepted his Affection, reproves him for the Action: <hi>Put up thy Sword, for they that take the Sword ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the Sword. Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt will thank no Man to fight for him without a Warrant and Commiſſion from him. To reſiſt a lawful Magiſtrate, even in Chriſt's own Defence, is raſh Zeal, and diſcountenanced by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> Our Lord's abſolute Refuſal to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued out of his Enemies Hands, with the Reaſon of it; did I encline to be reſcued by Force? As if our Lord had ſaid, I could command all the Troops of Angels in Heaven, to ſhew themſelves upon that Occaſion; but how can this ſtand with the Decree of my Father, with the Declarations of the Scripture, with the Demonſtration of my Mercy, and with the Salvation of miſerable Mankind? <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt was infinitely more concern'd for the Salvation of loſt Sinners, than for his own Death and Sufferings; more concerned for our Eternal Salvation, than for his own Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Preſervation. Had he been reſcued by the Power of Angels, we had faln a Prey into the Paw of Devils.</p>
               <p n="55">55 In that ſame hour ſaid Jeſus to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Are ye come out as againſt a thief with ſwords and ſtaves for to take me? I ſat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 56 But all this was done, that the ſcriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the diſciples forſook him, and fled.</p>
               <p>We had an Account of our Lord's Apprehenſion in the former Verſes, here the ſad Effect of it upon his Diſciples; <hi>They all forſake him and fled.</hi> They that ſaid all to Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Tho' we ſhould dye with thee, yet will we not deny thee,</hi> do here all of them deſert and forſake him; when it came to the puſh, not a Man of them ſtands by him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the holieſt Men know not their own Hearts, when great Temptations and Trials are before them, till they come to grapple with them, and to be engaged in them. We know not our own Strength till Temptation puts us to the Proof.</p>
               <p n="57">57 And they that had laid hold on Jeſus, led him away to Caiaphas the high prieſt, where the ſcribes and the elders were aſſembled. 58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high prieſts palace, and went in, and ſat with the ſervants to ſee the end. 59 Now the chief prieſts and elders, and all the counſel ſought falſe witneſs againſt Jeſus to put him to death; 60 But found none: yea, though many falſe witneſſes came, yet found they none. At the laſt came two falſe witneſſes, 61 And ſaid, This fellow ſaid, I am able to deſtroy the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and to build it in three days. 62 And the high prieſt aroſe, and ſaid unto him, Anſwereſt thou nothing? what is it which theſe witneſs againſt thee? 63 But Jeſus held his peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> having made good his Promiſe to the High Prieſt, and delivered Jeſus a Priſoner into their Hand, theſe Wolves of the Evening no ſooner ſeize the Lamb of God, but they thirſt, and long to ſuck his innocent Blood. Yet leſt it ſhould look like a down-right Murther, they will allow him a Mock-Trial, and abuſe the Law, by perverting it to Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Bloodſhed. Accordingly they induſtriouſly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born falſe-witneſſes to take away his Life, not ſticking at the groſſeſt Perjury, ſo they might deſtroy him. <hi>The Chief Prieſts and Elders, and all the Council, ſought falſe Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus to put him to Death.</hi> Abominable Wickedneſs! Innocency it ſelf cannot protect from Slander and falſe Accuſation. No Man is ſo innocent or good, whom falſe Witneſs may not condemn. Yet <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, Our Lord's Meekneſs and Patience, his ſubmiſſive Silence under all theſe wicked Suggeſtions and falſe Accuſations. <hi>Jeſus held his Peace,</hi> v. 63. Guilt is clamorous and impatient, Innocency is ſilent, and careleſs of miſ-reports. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That to bear the Revilings, Contradictions, and falſe Accuſations of Men, with a ſilent and ſubmiſſive Spirit, is an excellent and Chriſt-like Temper. Our Lord ſtood before his unjuſt Judges and falſe Accuſers, as <hi>a Sheep before the Shearer, dumb, and not opening his Mouth.</hi> Altho' a Trial for his Life was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged moſt maliciouſly and illegally againſt him; <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> Oh let the ſame humble Mind be in us which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus!</p>
               <p n="63">63 And the high prieſt anſwered and ſaid unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt, the Son of God. 64 Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thou haſt ſaid: nevertheleſs, I ſay unto you, Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 65 Then the high prieſt rent his cloaths, ſaying, He hath ſpoken blaſphemy: what further need have we of witneſſes? behold, now ye have heard his blaſphemy. 66 What think ye? They anſwered and ſaid, He is guilty of death. 67 Then did they ſpit in his face, and buffetted him, and others ſmote him with the palms of their hands, 68 Saying, Propheſie unto us, thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee?</p>
               <p>We obſerved even now that our Saviour was ſilent, and did make no Reply to the falſe Witneſſes that evidenced againſt him at his Trial, becauſe being ſo manifeſtly contradicting, they did fall to the Ground of themſelves. But now when
<pb facs="tcp:46556:42"/> the Queſtion was ſolemnly put by the High Prieſt, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>I am. Thence Learn,</hi> That altho' we are not obliged to anſwer every cavilling or enſnaring Queſtion, yet we are bound faithfully to own, and freely to confeſs the Truth, when we are ſolemnly called thereunto. Chriſt, who in the former Verſes was ſilent, <hi>and as a deaf Man that heard not,</hi> now <hi>witneſſes a good Confeſſion:</hi> Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, both by his Example and Command, to confeſs and own both him and his Truth, when lawfully required; when our Silence will be a denying of the Truth, a Diſhonour to God, and a Scandal to our Brethren: Chriſt knew that his Anſwer would coſt him his Life, and yet he durſt not but give it. <hi>Art thou the Son of the Bleſſed, Jeſus ſaid I am.</hi> Yea, farther <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That as Chriſt anſwer'd directly and plainly at his Trial, ſo he did not refuſe to anſwer upon Oath. <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, ſays the Judge of the Court, that thou tell us whether thou art the Chriſt.</hi> That is, I require thee to anſwer this Queſtion upon Oath; for adjuring a Perſon, or requiring them to anſwer upon Oath, was the manner of ſwearing among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now to this Adjuration our Saviour anſwer'd plainly and directly, <hi>I am, Mark</hi> 14.61. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> That ſwearing before a Magiſtrate upon a juſt and great Occaſion is lawful: If Chriſt in the Fifth of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> forbids all Oaths, then here his Practice was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Doctrine; but it is evident that Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Magiſtrate upon Oath, and ſo may we. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> The Sentence of Condemnation, which the Council paſſed upon him for owning himſelf to be the Son of God. <hi>He hath ſpoken Blaſphemy, and is worthy to die.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the unruly Rabble affront him with the vileſt Abuſes, and moſt horrid Indignities: <hi>They Spit in his Face, they Blind-fold him, they Smote him with their Fiſts and Palms of their Hands,</hi> and in a way of Contempt and Mockery they bid him Divine or Propheſie, <hi>who it was that ſmote him. Learn hence,</hi> That there is no Degree of Contempt, no Mark of Shame, no Kind of Suffering, which we ought to decline or ſtick at, for Chriſt's ſake, who hid not his Face from Shame and Spitting upon our Account.</p>
               <p n="69">69 Now Peter ſat without in the palace: and a damſel came unto him, ſaying, Thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo waſt with Jeſus of Galilee. 70 But he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them all, ſaying, I know not what thou ſayeſt. 71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid ſaw him, and ſaid unto them that were there, This fellow was alſo with Jeſus of Nazareth. 72 And again he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an oath, I do not know the man. 73 And after a while came unto him they that ſtood by, and ſaid unto Peter, ſurely thou alſo art one of them, for thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee. 74 Then he began to curſe and to ſwear, <hi>ſaying,</hi> I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 75 And Peter remembred the words of Jeſus, which ſaid unto him, Before the cock crow thou ſhalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>This laſt Paragraph of the Chapter gives us an Account of the Fall and Riſing of <hi>Peter;</hi> of his Sin, in denying Chriſt, and of his Recovery by a ſpeedy and ſevere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Both muſt be conſider'd diſtinctly. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sin and Fall, there are Four Particulars <hi>Obſervable;</hi> namely, the Sin it ſelf, the Occaſion of that Sin; the Reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Repetition of it, and the aggravating Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Sin it ſelf, the Denial of Chriſt, <hi>I know not the Man,</hi> a manifeſt Untruth. Next, he adds an Oath to confirm that Untruth; <hi>he ſwore that he knew not the Man.</hi> And laſt of all, he wiſh'd an <hi>horrid Curſe and Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon himſelf.</hi> That is, he wiſh'd himſelf excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and caſt out of the Church. Say ſome, he wiſh'd himſelf eternally ſeparated from the Preſence of God: Say others, he wiſh'd in effect that the Devil might take him if he were acquainted with Jeſus. The inordinate Love of Life, and ſlaviſh Fear of Sufferings and Death, may draw the beſt Men to commit the worſt of Sins. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Occaſions of this Sin, and they were Three; his following Chriſt afar off; his being in bad Company amongſt Chriſt's Enemies; and his preſumptuous Confidence of his own Strength and Standing. 1. <hi>His following of Christ afar off.</hi> To follow Chriſt is the Work of Faith, and Fruit of Love; but to follow him afar off, was the Effect of Fear and Frailty. Wo unto us when a Temptation comes if we be far off from Chriſt's Preſence and Aſſiſtance. 2. His being in wicked Company amongſt Chriſt's Enemies. Oh <hi>Peter,</hi> thou hadſt better have been a cold by thy ſelf alone, than ſitting by a Fire, compaſſed in with the Blaſphemies of the wicked; where thy Conſcience, tho' not ſeared, was yet made hard. The way to eſcape prevailling Temptations to Sin, is to ſhun ſuch Places, and avoid ſuch Companions, as in all Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will invite and draw us into Sin. 3. Confidence of his own Strength and Standing was another Occaſion of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Falling. Pride and preſumptuous Confidence have been ever the Forerunners and Occaſions of a Fall. Oh Lord! to preſume upon our ſelves is the ready way to provoke thee to leave us to our ſelves, if ever we ſtand in the Day of Trial. 'Tis the fear of falling muſt enable us to ſtand, <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Reiteration and Repetition of this Sin. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him a <hi>Firſt, Second,</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Time. He denies him firſt <hi>with a Lie,</hi> then <hi>with an Oath,</hi> and after all, <hi>with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema,</hi> and a <hi>Curſe.</hi> Oh how dangerous is it, not to reſiſt the firſt Beginnings of Sin.! If we yield to one Temptation, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will aſſault us with more, and ſtronger. <hi>Peter</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a bare Denial, firſt to Perjury, then to Curſing and Imprecation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The aggravating Circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sin of <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and they are theſe; 1. The Character of the Perſon thus falling; a Diſciple, an Apoſtle, a chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, a ſpecial Favourite; who with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had the ſpecial Honour to be with Chriſt upon <hi>Mount Tabor. Peter,</hi> who had preached and propheſied in Chriſt's Name, caſt out Devils, and wrought Miracles by Chriſt's Power, yet he denies him. 2. Conſider the Perſon whom he denies; his <hi>Maſter,</hi> his Saviour and Redeemer; he that had waſhed <hi>Peter</hi>'s Feet but a little before; that eat the Paſſover with <hi>Peter,</hi> and gave the Sacrament to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet this kind and condeſcending Saviour was denied by <hi>Peter.</hi> 3. Conſider before whom he denies him, in the Company and Preſence of the chief Prieſts, Scribes and Elders, and their Servants, who rejoiced at it, and were hardned by it. That one Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould ſell him for Money, and another Diſciple deny him thro' Fear. 4. Conſider the Time when he denied him; verily it was but a few Hours after he had received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper from Chriſt's own Hand. How unreaſonrble then is their Objection againſt coming to the Lord's Table, becauſe ſome that go to it diſhonour Chriſt as ſoon as they come from it. Such Examples muſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us from coming to the Ordinance, but excite and encreaſe our Watchfulneſs after we have been there, to take heed that the future Conduct of our Lives be ſuitable to the Solemnity of a Sacramental Table. 5. Conſider the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Temptation to deny Chriſt; a Damſel only put the Queſtion to him, <hi>Art thou not one of his Diſciples?</hi> If a Band of armed Soldiers had appeared to him, and affrighted him; had he been terrified by the high Prieſt's Threatnings, bound and led away to Judgment, ſentenced to an ignominious painful Death, ſome Excuſe might have been made for him: But to diſown his Relation to Chriſt at the Queſtion of a Maid-Servant that kept the Door only; the ſmalneſs of the Temptation was an Aggravation of the Crime. Ah, <hi>Peter,</hi> how unlike thy ſelf art thou at this time? Not a Rock, but a Reed, a Pillar blown down by a Woman's Breath. Oh frail Humanity, whoſe Strength is Weakneſs and Infirmity! <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> That in moſt of the Saint's Falls, recorded in Scripture, either the firſt Inticers, or the accidental Occaſion; were Women. Thus in <hi>Adam</hi>'s, <hi>Lot</hi>'s, <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s, <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s and <hi>Peter</hi>'s. A weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be a ſtrong Tempter; nothing is too impotent or uſeleſs for the Devil's Service. It was a great Aggravation of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sin, that the Voice of a Maid, a Door-keeper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould be ſtronger to overcome him, than his Faith in Jeſus to ſuſtain him. But what ſhall we ſay? Small things are ſufficient to caſt us down, if God doth not hold us up. We ſink under any Burden, if he ſuſtains us not, and yeild to every Temptation, if he leaves us to our ſelves. A Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhall then make a Diſciple ſhrink, and a Door-keeper is enough to drive an Apoſtle before her. <hi>And immediately the Cock crew. And</hi> Peter <hi>remembred the Words of Jeſus, which ſaid unto him, Before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice, and he went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> Here we have an Account of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Riſing and Recovery after his ſhameful Fall, by a renewed Act and Exerciſe of Repentance. Where <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:43"/> The Suddenneſs of his Repentance, the Means of his Repentance, and the Manner of it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Suddenneſs of his Repentance. Altho' his Sin was great, yet was his Repentance ſpeedy, and without Delay. From whence, <hi>Note,</hi> That Sins committed by the ſurprizal of a ſudden Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are much ſooner repented of, than where the Sin is preſumptuous and deliberate. <hi>David</hi>'s Sins of Murther and Adultery were preſumptuous and deliberate Sins; he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time in them, and lived almoſt a Twelvemonth without any ſolemn Repentance of them. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sin was haſty and ſudden under a violent Paſſion of Fear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his ſettled Purpoſe and Reſolution of Conſtancy, and he takes the warning of the ſecond crowing of the Cock, and goes forth to expreſs his Repentance. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Means of his Repentance, which was twofold. Leſs Principal, <hi>the crowing of the Cock;</hi> more principal, <hi>Christ's looking upon</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> Peter<hi>'s remembring the Words of Christ.</hi> 1. The leſs principal Means of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance <hi>was the crowing of the Cock.</hi> As the Voice of the Maid occaſioned him to ſin, ſo the Voice of the Cock occaſion'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. That God who can work without Means, does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times work by weak and contemptible Means, and when he pleaſes can open the Mouth of a Bird or a Beaſt for the Converſion of a Man. But why ſhould our Saviour chuſe the crowing of the Cock as a Means to bring St. <hi>Peter</hi> to Repentance? There is ever ſome Myſtery in Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; the Cock was a Preacher to call <hi>Peter</hi> to Repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance, there being ſomething of Emblem between the Cock and a Preacher. A true Miniſter muſt have the Wings of a Cock to rouze up himſelf from Security, and to awaken others to a Senſe of their Duty. He muſt have the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of a Cock to be ever ready to diſcover and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn Danger; he muſt have the Voice of the Cock, <hi>to cry aloud, and tell</hi> Iſrael <hi>of their Sins,</hi> and terrifie the roaring Lion, and make him tremble. In a word, he muſt obſerve the Hours of the Cock to crow at all Seaſons of the Night, <hi>to preach in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon,</hi> the glad Tydings of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, 2. The more principal Means of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was, 1. <hi>Chriſt's looking upon</hi> Peter. Chriſt firſt looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Peter</hi> with an Eye of Mercy, Grace and Pity, before <hi>Peter</hi> looks upon his Sin in order to Repentance. Here take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Greatneſs of Chriſt's Grace, of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Love and Mercy to this poor Diſciple. When our Saviour was upon his Trial for his Life, a time when our Thoughts are wholly taken up about our ſelves, even then did Chriſt find Leiſure to think upon <hi>Peter,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to turn about, and give him a pittiful, but piercing Look; a Look, that melted his Heart, and diſſolved it into Tears. We never begin to lament for Sin, till we are firſt lamented by our Saviour. <hi>Jeſus looked upon</hi> Peter. That is the firſt more principal Means of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance; the ſecond is, Peter<hi>'s remembring the Words of Chriſt before the Cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> This Remembrance of Chriſt's Words was an applicative and feeling Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them. He remembred the Prediction of Chriſt, and applies it ſenſibly to himſelf. <hi>Teaching us,</hi> That the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Chriſts Word in order to the bringing of a Soul unto Repentance, depends not upon the Hiſtorical Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, but upon the cloſe Application of it to every Man's Conſcience. A ſanctified Remembrance of Chriſt's Words, and our own Sins, is an excellent Preparative to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> The Manner of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance. It was ſecret, <hi>he went out;</hi> it was ſincere, <hi>he wept bitterly;</hi> it was laſting and abiding, all the Days of his Life, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an extraordinary Zeal and Forwardneſs for the Service of Chriſt to the end of his Life. 1. It was ſecret, <hi>he went out, Vere dolet, qui ſine Teſte dolet.</hi> He ſought a Place of Retirement where he might mourn in ſecret; he cannot well be thought to diſſemble his Grief, who chuſes no other Witneſs but the Omnipreſent God. Solitarineſs is moſt agreeable to an afflicted Spirit; and as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sorrow cauſed him to go forth, ſo might alſo Shame: Chriſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Peter,</hi> but how aſhamed muſt <hi>Peter</hi> be to look upon Chriſt, conſidering that he ſo lately denied to have ever ſeen him? 2. His Repentance was ſincere, <hi>he wept bitterly;</hi> his Grief was extraordinary, and his Tears abundant. There is ever a weeping that follows Sin; Sin muſt coſt the Soul Sorrow, either here, or in Hell; we muſt mourn awhile, or lament for ever. Doubtleſs with <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tears there was join'd hearty Confeſſion of Sin to God, and ſmart Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions upon himſelf after this manner: Lord, what have I done? I, that did once acknowledge my Maſter <hi>to be Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi> have ſince denied him with Oaths, Curſes and Imprecations: I, that promiſed to lay down my Life for his ſake, have yet diſown'd and denied him at the Voice of a Damſel. Oh what Unfaithfulneſs, what Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what Wickedneſs! <hi>Oh that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep all my Days for the Fault of this one Night.</hi> Bleſſed indeed are the Tears of a converted Revolter, and happy is the very Miſery of a mourning Offender. 3. This holy Man's Repentance was laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abiding, he had a lively Senſe and Remembrance of this Sin upon his Soul all his Life. Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory reports, that ever after, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> heard the crowing of a Cock, he fell upon his Knees, and mourn'd; others ſay, that he was wont to riſe at Midnight, and ſpend the time in penitent Devotion between Cock-crowing and Day-light; and the Papiſts, who love to turn every thing into Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, began that Practice of ſetting a Cock upon the top of Towers, and Steeples, and Chimneys, to put People in mind of this Sin of <hi>Peter,</hi> and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Repentance by that Signal. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance was attended with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Zeal and Forwardneſs for the Service of Chriſt to the end of his Life. He had a burning Love towards Chriſt. <hi>Thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee:</hi> And as an Evidence of it, he fed Chriſt's Sheep; for in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles we read of his extraordinary Diligence to ſpread the Goſpel, and his Travels in order thereunto are computed to be Nine Hundred and Fifty Miles: And the Wiſdom of God thought fit that this Apoſtle ſhould preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did to the Gentiles; that as he had joined with the <hi>Jews</hi> in denying and diſowning Chriſt, ſo he ſhould endeavour to perſwade them to join with him in Repentance, as he had joined with them in their Sin. His Sin was in ſome Reſpect like theirs, therefore is he ſent to preach the Goſpel to them, and his Diligence therein is an undoubted Proof and Evidence of his Repentance. Have any of us fallen with <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' not with a formal abjuring, yet by a practical denying of him, let us go forth and weep with him, let us be more vigilant and watchful over our ſelves for time to come, let us expreſs more extraordinary Love unto, and Zeal for Chriſt, more Diligence in his Service, and more Concernedneſs for his Honour and Glory. This would be an happy Improvement of this Example. The Lord grant it may have that bleſſed Effect. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>The foregoing Chapter gave us an Account of <hi>Judas</hi> his Treaſon, in delivering our Saviour into the Hands of the chief Prieſts. In this Chapter we find our holy Lord brought by the chief Prieſts unto <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the Roman Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in order to his Arraignment and Condemnation. Whence <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that it has been the old Policy of corrupt Church-Governors, to abuſe the Power of the civil Magiſtrate, in executing their cruel and unjuſt Cenſures upon holy and innocent Perſons. The chief Prieſts and Elders do not kill our Saviour themſelves, but they deliver him over to the ſecular Power, and deſire <hi>Pilate</hi> the civil Magiſtrate to ſentence and condemn him, which ſoon after we ſhall find he did.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then Judas which had betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and brought again the thirty pieces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the chief prieſts and elders, 4 Saying, I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood. And they ſaid, What is that to us? ſee thou to that. 5 And he caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himſelf.</p>

                  </gap>e; as alſo of the Horror of his Mind and Conſcience before his Death. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The time when <hi>Judas</hi> repented, after it was too late. <hi>When he ſaw that he was condemned, he repented. Learn thence,</hi> That they that will not ſee their Sins timely to their Converſion, ſhall ſee them ſooner or later to their Confuſion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Repentance it ſelf, in the ſeveral Parts and Branches of it. He was ſorrowful for the Fact, he made Confeſſion of his Sin, and made Reſtitution for the Wrong done. <hi>He repented, ſaying, I have ſinned, and caſt down the Thirty Pieces of Silver. Learn thence,</hi> That a wicked Man, when Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is thoroughly awaked, may make Confeſſion of his Sin, expreſs ſome Sorrow for it, and endeavour alſo the making ſome Satisfaction and Reſtitution for the Wrong and Injury done by it. They that mourn for Sin, as Sin: They that mourn more for the intrinſical Evil that is in Sin, than for the Penal and Conſequential Evils that follow Sin: They that confeſs Sin voluntarily and freely, particularly, penitently, believingly, with an Eye of Sorrow upon their Sin, and an Eye of Faith fixt upon their Saviour: They that make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as an Act of Obedience to the Command of God, and as an Act of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſuch Perſons Repentance ſhall find Acceptance with God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Anſwer and Reply which the wicked high Prieſts and Elders make to deſpairing <hi>Judas.</hi> 1. They excuſe themſelves, <hi>What is that to us?</hi> 'Tis natural to all Sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners to ſhift Sin from themſelves, and to lay it at any Door, rather than their own. Thoſe that have had a Share in the Pleaſure and Profit of Sin, are yet very deſirous to throw the Odium and Guilt of it upon others. <hi>What is that to us?</hi> ſay theſe Monſters in Sin. 2. As they excuſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelves, ſo they load and burthen him; <hi>Look thou to that.</hi> Lord, what miſerable Comforters are Companions in Sin to one another, when Diſtreſs and Sorrow comes upon them?

                  </gap>ence, which was ſo intolerable, that he ran to the Halter for a Remedy. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Conſcience is a powerful, tho' inviſible Executioner; the Wrath of Man may be endured, but the Wrath of God is inſupportable, and the Eruptions of Conſcience are irreſiſtible. Oh how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable are thoſe Scourges that laſh us in this tender and vital Part! <hi>Judas</hi> awakened with the Horror of his Fact, Conſcience begins to rouze, and the Man is unable to bear up under the furious Revenges of his own Mind. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That there is an active Principle in Mens Breaſts and Boſoms, which ſeldom ſuffers daring Sinners to paſs in quiet to their Graves. Guilt is naturally troubleſome and uneaſie, it diſturbs the Peace and Serenity of the Mind, and fills the Soul with Storms and Thunder, both in Life and Death: How vainly did <hi>Judas</hi> hope to take Sanctuary in a Grave, and to meet with that Eaſe in another World which he could not find in this. Thus ended this miſerable Man, <hi>Judas.</hi> Lord, how earneſt ought we to be for thy perſevering Grace, when neither the Preſence, the Miracles, the Sermons, the Sacraments of Chriſt could preſerve and ſecure a Profeſſor, a Diſciple, an Apoſtle, from the fatal Miſchief of a ruinous Apoſtacy?</p>
               <p n="6">6 And the chief prieſts took the ſilver pieces, and ſaid, It is not lawful for to put them into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of blood. 7 And they took counſel, and bought with them the potters field, to bury ſtrangers in. 8 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. 9 (Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Jeremy the prophet, ſaying.

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Niceneſs and Scrupuloſity of theſe Hypocrites; they made no Scruple to give Money to ſhed Blood, but they ſcruple the putting that Money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treaſury, which was the Price of Blood. They are afraid to defile their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The uſe which they put this Money to, which <hi>Judas</hi> brought them; they bought with it a Field to bury Strangers in. Thus Chriſt, who was himſelf a Stranger in a borrow'd Grave, by the Price of his Blood (being Thirty Pieces of Silver) conferred Graves on many Strangers. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> How the Wiſdom of God order'd it, that hereby a Scripture-Prophecy was fulfilled, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.13. They weighed for my Price Thirty Pieces of Silver, and I took and caſt them unto the Potter. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That all the Indignities and debaſing Sufferings, which the Lord Jeſus underwent, were not only fore-ordain'd by God, but alſo foretold by the holy Prophets: His being Scourged, Buffetted, Spit upon, and here his being ſold for Thirty Pieces of Silver.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And Jeſus ſtood before the governour, and the governour asked him, ſaying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſayeſt. 12 And when he was accuſed of the chief prieſts and elders, he anſwered nothing. 13 Then ſaith Pilate unto him, Heareſt thou not how many things they witneſs againſt thee? 14 And he anſwered him to never a word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the governour marvelled greatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That our Saviour readily anſwers <hi>Pilate,</hi> but refuſes to anſwer the chief Prieſts before <hi>Pilate.

But to all the Accuſations of the chief Prieſts, and to all that they laid to his Charge before <hi>Pilate,</hi> our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers never a Word, probably for theſe Reaſons. Becauſe his Innocency was ſuch as needed no Apology; becauſe their Calumnies and Accuſations were ſo notoriouſly falſe, that they needed no Confutation. To ſhew his Contempt of Death, and to teach us by his own Example Patience and Silence, when for his ſake we are ſlandered and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That altho' we are not obliged to anſwer every captious and enſnaring Queſtion, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute every Slander and falſe Accuſation, yet are we bound faithfully to own and confeſs the Truth, when we are ſolemnly called thereunto. Our Saviour as <hi>a deaf Man hears not,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers not the Calumnies of the chief Prieſts; but when <hi>Pilate</hi> asks him, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> Or as St. <hi>Mark</hi> has it, <hi>Art thou the Son of the Bleſſed?</hi> Jeſus ſaid, <hi>I am,</hi> tho' he knew that Anſwer would coſt him his Life. Hence the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. ſays, <hi>That Chriſt before</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good Confeſſion. Teaching us,</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to hold our Peace, when our own Reputation is concerned; but never to be ſilent, when the Honour of God, the Glory of his Truth, the Edification and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of others, may effectually be promoted by our open Confeſſion. Then muſt we with Chriſt give a direct, plain, and ſincere Anſwer. For <hi>whoever denies him, or any Truth of his, knowingly and wilfully, him will Chriſt deny in the Preſence of his Father, and before all his Holy Angels.</hi>

                  <hi>Pilate</hi> makes a Motion to them, that Chriſt may be the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſet at Liberty in Honour of their Feaſt; for he was ſenſible that what they did was out of Envy and Malice. As Covetouſneſs ſold Chriſt, ſo Envy deliver'd him. Envy is a killing and murthering Paſſion; <hi>Envy ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſilly one,</hi> Job 5.2. That is, it ſlays the ſilly Perſon, who harbours this peſtilent Luſt in his Boſom, and is like a Fire in his Bones continually preying upon him, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to pine away, and dye miſerably, becauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lives happily. To envy another Man's Proſperity is an Argument of the worſt Simplicity: Yea, farther, as Envy ſlayeth the ſilly one, ſo it prompts and provokes the Sinner to ſeek the ſlaying of ſimple and innocent ones. Envy wiſhes the envied Perſon out of the way, yea, out of the World; and if need be, will not only wiſh it, but lend a lift towards it too: Witneſs the Chief Prieſts here, whoſe Envy was ſo conſpicuous, that <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf takes notice of it, and ſays, <hi>He knew that for Envy they had delivered him.</hi>

               <p n="19">19 When he was ſet down on the judgment-ſeat, his wife ſent unto him, ſaying, Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man; for I have ſuffered many things this day in a dream, becauſe of him.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral ſorts or kinds of Dreams, Natural, Moral, Diabolical and Divine. The Queſtion is, what kind of Dream this was? Not <hi>Natural,</hi> all agree; ſome think it was <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and that Satan hoped thereby to prevent the Work of Man's Redemption by the Death of Chriſt. But if ſo, why had not <hi>Pilate</hi> the Dream rather than his Wife? Probably this Dream was from God; for even our very Dreams are order'd by God, our ſleeping as well as our waking times are in God's Hand. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> How wonderfully the Wiſdom and Power of God is ſeen in this Woman's Teſtimony, which ſhe gave to the Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Saviour. When all his Diſciples were fled from him, when none of his Friends durſt ſpeak a Word for him, God raiſes up a Woman, a Stranger, a Pagan, to give Evidence of his Innocency. And it is <hi>Obſervable,</hi> That at our Saviour's Trial, not one Mouth was opened to plead or ſpeak a Word for him, in Defence of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it ſelf, but only <hi>Pilate</hi>'s and his Wife's; they both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him Righteous, tho' they were Gentiles and Pagans, whilſt his own Kindred and Countrymen, the <hi>Jews,</hi> thirſt after his Righteous and Innocent Blood.</p>
               <p n="20">20 But the chief prieſts and elders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the multitude that they ſhould ask Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas, and deſtroy Jeſus. 21 The governour anſwered and ſaid unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I releaſe unto you? They ſaid, Barabbas. 22 Pilate ſaid unto them, What ſhall I do then with Jeſus, which is called Chriſt? They all ſay unto him, Let him be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. 23 And the governour ſaid, Why, what evil hath he done? but they cried out the more, ſaying, Let him be crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How exceedingly unwilling and averſe <hi>Pilate</hi> was to be the Inſtrument of our Saviour's Death; one while he bids the <hi>Jews</hi> take him themſelves, and judge him according to their Law. Another while he offers to ſave Chriſt in Honour of their Feaſt, when by Cuſtom he was to releaſe a Priſoner, and this Priſoner he deſired might be Jeſus. When this would not ſatisfie, he expoſtulates with them about our Saviour's Innocency, what Evil has he done? Nay, St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, <hi>Ch.</hi> 23. <hi>That</hi> Pilate <hi>came forth three times, and profeſſed that he found no Fault in him.</hi> Yet tho' <hi>Pilate</hi> was ſatisfied, the <hi>Jews</hi> would not be deny'd. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That wicked Men and Hypocrites within the viſible Church may be guilty of ſuch Tremendous Acts of Wickedneſs, as the Conſcience of Infidels and Pagans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church may boggle at, and proteſt againſt. <hi>Pilate</hi> a Pagan abſolves Chriſt, whilſt hypocritical <hi>Jews,</hi> which had heard his Doctrine, and ſeen his Miracles, do condemn him. But <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Who influenced the main Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> to deſire <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and to deſtroy Jeſus. It was the <hi>chief Priests and Elders,</hi> they <hi>perſwaded the Multitude.</hi> Wo to the People when their Guides and Leaders are corrupt; for then they ſhall be tempted by wicked Counſel: And wo unto them, much more, if they follow their wicked and pernicious Counſels. Thus did the <hi>Jews</hi> follow their Guides the chief Prieſts, till they had preſerv'd <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and deſtroy'd Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="24">24 When Pilate ſaw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am innocent of the blood of this juſt perſon: ſee ye to it.</p>
               <p>Two Things are here <hi>Obſervable</hi> in <hi>Pilate</hi>'s <hi>waſhing of his Hands.</hi> 1. By this Action he pronounces our Saviour's Innocency, and was willing thereby to teſtifie his own; that he did not conſent to our Saviour's Death, waſhing the Hands being an uſual Ceremony in Proteſtation of a Perſon's Innocency. But, 2. It was great Folly and Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Pilate,</hi> to think that waſhing of his Hands did or could free him from the Guilt of innocent Blood. Oh <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late!</hi> thou hadſt need rub hard if thou meaneſt to ſcoure from thy Soul the Guilt of that Crimſon Sin which thou haſt committed; thy Guilt cleaves ſo cloſe unto thee, that nothing can expiate it but the Blood which thou haſt ſpilt; neither was it any Excuſe of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Sin, that what he did was to pleaſe the People, and to gratifie their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. It is a fond Apology for Sins, when Perſons pretend that they were not committed with their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but at others Inſtigation and Importunity.</p>

               <p>That is, Let the Guilt and Puniſhment of this Blood reſt upon us and our Poſterity.

               <p n="26">26 Then releaſed he Barabbas unto them: and when he had ſcourged Jeſus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>
               <p>As the Death of the Croſs was a Roman Puniſhment, ſo it was the manner of the Romans firſt to ſcourge and whip their Malefactors, and then deliver them to be crucified. Now the manner of the Roman ſcourging is ſaid to be thus: They ſtript the condemned Perſon, and bound him to a Poſt; Two ſtrong Men firſt ſcourged him with Rods of Thorns: Then Two others ſcourged him with Whips of Cords full of Knots; and laſtly, Two more with Whips of Wyre, and therewith tore off the very Fleſh and Skin from the Perſons Back and Sides. That our Saviour was thus cruelly ſcourged ſeems to ſome not improbable from that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.3. <hi>The Ploughers ploughed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Back, and made long Furrows.</hi> Which, if ſpoken Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically of Chriſt, was Literally fulfilled in the Day of his Scourging. But why was the precious Body of our Bleſſed Lord thus galled and torn with Scourgings?

               <p n="27">27 Then the ſoldiers of the governour took Jeſus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of ſoldiers. 28 And they ſtripped him, and put on him a ſcarlet robe. 29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying, Hail king of the Jews. 30 And they ſpit upon him, and took the reed, and ſmote him on the head. 31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucifie him.</p>

Thus all the Marks of Scorn imaginable are put upon our Bleſſed Redeemer, yet that which they did in jeſt, God did in earneſt; for all theſe things were Enſigns and Marks of Soveraignty, and Almighty God cauſed the Regal Dignity of his Son to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and ſhine forth even in the midſt of his greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement. Whence was all this Jearing and Sport, but to flout Majeſty? And why did Chriſt undergo all this Ignominy, Diſgrace and Shame, but to ſhew us what was due unto us for our Sins, and to give us an Example to bear all the Scorn, Reproach and Shame imaginable for his ſake, <hi>Who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Shame.</hi>

This ſhameful, painful and accurſed Death, did the holy and innocent Jeſus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go for Sinners. Some obſerve all the Dimenſions of Length, Breadth, Depth, and Height in our Saviour's Sufferings; for Length his Paſſion was ſeveral Hours long, from Twelve to Three, expoſed all that time both to Hunger and Cold; the Thieves crucified with him were not dead ſo ſoon; they enduring but perſonal Pain, he undergoing the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all Mankind. But what his Paſſion wanted in Length, it had in Breadth, extending over all the Parts and Powers of his Soul and Body, no part free but his Tongue, which was at Liberty to pray for his Enemies. His Sight was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the ſcornful Geſtures of ſuch as <hi>paſſed by, wagging their Heads.</hi> His Hearing grieved with the Taunts and Jears of Prieſts and People; his Smelling offended with noiſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the Place of Skulls; his Taſte with the Gall and Vinegar given him to drink; his Feeling was wonderfully affected by the Nails, which pierced his Hand and Feet, and the Crown of Thorns which pierced his tender Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with a Multiplicity of Wounds. And for the Depth of his Paſſion it was as deep as Hell it ſelf; enduring Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his Soul, as well as Torments in his Body; groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Burthen of Deſertion, and crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> Laſtly, For the Height of his Sufferings, they were as high as Heaven, his Perſon being innocent and infinite, no leſs than the Son of God, which adds infinite Worth and Value to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Lord, let us be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the Breadth and Length, Depth and Heighth, and let us know the Love of Christ, which in ſuffering for us, paſſeth Knowledge.</hi> So infinite every way were the Dimenſions of it.</p>

               <p>Here we have ſeveral Aggravations of our Lord's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the Ctoſs. 1. From the Company he ſuffer'd with, <hi>Two Thieves.</hi> It had been Diſparagement enough to
<pb facs="tcp:46556:45"/> our Bleſſed Saviour to have been ſorted with the Beſt of Men; but to be numbered with the Scum of Mankind is ſuch an Indignity as confounds our Thoughts. This was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to diſhonour him the more, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World that he was the greateſt of Offenders; but God over-ruled this, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. <hi>He was numbered with the Tranſgreſſors.</hi> 2. Another Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Lord's Sufferings on the Croſs, was the Scorn and mocking Deriſion, which he met with in his dying Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from the common People, from the chief Prieſts, and from the Thieves that ſuffer'd with him. The common People, both in Words and Actions expreſſed Scorn and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt him. <hi>They reviled him, wagging their Heads.</hi> The chief Prieſts, tho' Men of Age and Gravity, not only barbarouſly <hi>mock him</hi> in his extreameſt Miſery, whom Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity obliged them to Pity; but they ſcoff Atheiſtically and Prophanely, jeering at his Faith and Affiance in God, tauntingly ſaying, <hi>He truſted in God, that he would deliver him; now let him deliver him, if he will have him.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That Perſecutors are generally Atheiſts, tho' they make a Profeſſion of Religion. <hi>The chief Prieſts and Elders</hi> here, tho' learned and knowing Men, yet they blaſpheme God, and mock at his Power, deride his Providence, which was as bad as to deny his Being. Hence we may gather, that thoſe who adminiſter to God in Holy Things by way of Office, if they be not the beſt, they are the worſt of Men. No ſuch bitter Enemies to the Power of Godlineſs, as the Miniſters of Religion, who were never acquainted with the Efficacy and Power of it in their own Hearts and Lives. A Third Aggravation of our Lord's Sufferings on the Croſs was, That the Thief's that ſuffered with him, reviled him with the reſt. That is, one of them, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> has it, or perhaps both of them might do it at firſt. Which if ſo, encreaſes the Wonder of the penitent Thieves Converſion. From the Thief's Impenitency we <hi>Learn,</hi> That neither Shame nor Pain will change the Mind of a reſolute Sinner, but even then when he is in the very Suburbs of Hell will he blaſpheme.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Now from the ſixth hour there was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over all the land unto the ninth hour, 46 And about the ninth hour Jeſus cried with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Eli, Eli, Lamaſabachthani?</hi> that is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me? 47 Some of them that ſtood there, when they heard that, ſaid, This man calleth for Elias. 48 And ſtraightway one of them run, and took a ſpunge, and filled it with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 49 The reſt ſaid, Let be, let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elias will come to ſave him. 50 Jeſus when he had cried again with a loud voice, yeilded up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Rays of Chriſt's Divinity, and the Glory of his Godhead, breaks out and ſhines forth in the midſt of that Infirmity, which his Humane Nature laboured under. He ſhews himſelf to be the God of Nature, by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Courſe of Nature. The Sun is eclipſed, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs overſpreads the Earth for <hi>Three Hours;</hi> namely, from Twelve a Clock to Three. Thus the Sun in the Firmament becomes cloſe Mourner at our Lord's Death, and the whole Frame of Nature puts it ſelf into a Funeral Habit. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That the Soul of Chriſt's Sufferings conſiſted in the Sufferings of his Soul; the Diſtreſs of his Spirit was more intolerable than the Torments of his Body, as appears by his mournful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Being the firſt Words of the 22d. <hi>Pſalm;</hi> and ſome conceive that he repeated that whole Pſalm, it being an admirable Narrative of the Dolours of his Paſſion. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ſuffering for our Sins, was really deſerted for a Time, and left deſtitute of all ſenſible Conſolation. <hi>Why hast thou forſaken me? Learn</hi> farther, That under this Deſertion Chriſt deſpaired not, but ſtill retain'd a firm Perſwaſion of God's Love unto him, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced neceſſary Supports from him. <hi>My God, my God,</hi> Theſe are Words of Faith and Affiance, ſtriving under Temptation. Chriſt was thus forſaken for us, that we might never be forſaken by God; yet by God's forſaking of Chriſt, is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood any Abatement of Divine Love, but only a With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the Humane Nature, the Senſe of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Love, and a letting out upon his Soul a deep afflicting Senſe of his Diſpleaſure againſt Sin. There is a total and eternal Deſertion, by which God utterly forſakes a Man, both as to Grace and Glory, being wholly caſt out of God's Preſence, and adjudged to Eternal Torments, this was not compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt, nor agreeable to the Dignity of his Perſon. But theſe is a Partial and Temporary Deſertion, when God <hi>for a little Moment hides his Face</hi> from his Children; now this was both agreeable to the Dignity of Chriſt's Nature, and alſo ſuitable to his Office, who was to ſatisfie the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for our forſaking of him, and to bring us near to him, that we might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e received for ever. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> What a miraculous Evidence Chriſt gave of his Divinity inſtantly before he gave up the Ghoſt. <hi>He cried with a loud Voice.</hi> This ſhew'd that he did not dye according to the ordinary Courſe of Nature, gradually departing and drawing on, as we expreſs it. No, his Life was whole in him, and Nature as ſtrong at laſt as at firſt. Other Men dye gradually, and towards their End their Senſe of Pain is much blunted; they faulter, fumble, and dye by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but Chriſt ſtood under the Pains of Death in his full Strength; his Life was whole in him. This was evident by the mighty Outcry he made when he gave up the Ghoſt, contrary to the Senſe and Experience of all other Perſons; this argued him to be full of Strength. And he that could cry with ſuch a loud Voice, <hi>(in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulo mortis)</hi> as he did, could have kept himſelf from dying if he would. Hence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That when Chriſt died, he rather conquered Death, than was conquer'd by Death. He muſt voluntarily and freely lay down Life before Death could come at him.</p>
               <p n="51">51 And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, 52 And the graves were opened, and many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ſaints which ſlept, aroſe, 53 And came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jeſus, ſaw the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and thoſe things that were done, they feared greatly, ſaying, Truly this was the Son of God. 55 And many women were there (behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afar off) which followed Jeſus from Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, miniſtering unto him. 56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Joſes, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</p>
               <p>Here we have an Account of ſeveral extraordinary and wonderful Things, which occurr'd and fell out about the time that our Saviour died. 1. <hi>The Vail of the Temple rent aſunder.</hi> That is, the Partition Wall of Stone between the Sanctuary and the outer Court was now broken down. <hi>Signifying,</hi> That the ceremonial Law was now aboliſhed by the Death of Chriſt, and that by the Blood of Jeſus we have Acceſs unto God, and may enter into the Holy of Holies. 2. The Earth quak'd. As there was an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Eclipſe, ſo likewiſe an Univerſal Earthquake at our Lord's Crucifixion, which did awaken many of the Saints, (that died before our Saviour's Incarnation) out of their dead Sleep. Theſe aroſe both as Witneſſes of Chriſt's Reſurrection, and alſo as Sharers in it. But none of them aroſe till Chriſt was riſen, <hi>he being the firſt Fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> And theſe holy Perſons that aroſe with him, poſſibly attended him to Heaven at his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. From hence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſt was the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of thoſe that believed in him before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as thoſe that believed in him ſince his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; and that the former are Partakers of the Fruit and Benefit of his Death and Reſurrection, no leſs than the latter. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, What Influence and Effect the ſight of theſe prodigious Things had upon the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> and the <hi>Soldiers:</hi> It convinced them, that <hi>verily this was the Son of God.</hi> Here we ſee the Heathen Soldiers
<pb facs="tcp:46556:45"/> are ſooner convinced of the Divinity of Chriſt, than the unbelieving Jewiſh Doctors. Obſtinacy and Unbelief fill'd their Minds with an invincible Prejudice againſt Chriſt; ſo that neither the Miracles done by him in his Life, nor wrought at his Death, could convince the high Prieſts, that Chriſt was any other than an Impoſtor and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> Who of Chriſt's Friends were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Death; <hi>They are Women who followed him from</hi> Galilee, <hi>and miniſtred unto him;</hi> not one of his dear Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, except St. <hi>John,</hi> who ſtood by the Croſs with the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> What a Shame was this for the Apoſtles to be abſent from a Spectacle upon which the Salvation of the whole World did depend; and what an Honour was this to the Female Sex in general, and to theſe Women in particular, that they had the Courage to follow Chriſt to his Croſs, <hi>when all his Diſciples forſook him and fled.</hi> God can make Women Glorious Confeſſors of his Truth, and arm them againſt the Fears of Sufferings, contrary to the natural Timor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſneſs of their Tempers. Theſe Women wait upon Chriſt's Croſs, when Apoſtles fly, and durſt not come near it.</p>
               <p n="57">57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joſeph, who alſo himſelf was Jeſus diſciple: 58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jeſus: then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. 59 And when Joſeph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linnen cloth, 60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great ſtone to the door of the ſepulchre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. 61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary ſitting over againſt the ſepulchre.</p>
               <p>Here we have an Account given of our Lord's Funeral and Interment in the Grave; ſuch a Funeral as never was ſince Graves were firſt digged. Concerning which we have theſe Particulars <hi>Obſervable:</hi> 1. The Preparatives that were made for our Lord's Funeral; namely, the begging and perfuming of his dead Body; his Body could not be buried, till by begging it was obtain'd of <hi>Pilate,</hi> the dead Bodies of Malefactors being in the Power of the Diſpoſal of the Judge. <hi>Pilate</hi> grants it; and to manifeſt their dear Affection to their dead Lord, they wrap the Body in fine Linnen, with Spices to perfume it. But what need of Odours for that Body which could not ſee Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: Tho' his holy Body did not want them, yet the Affections of his Friends could not withhold them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Bearers that carried his Body to the Grave, or the Perſons concern'd in ſolemnizing his Funeral. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> Two rich Men, and Two ſecret Diſciples. 1. They were rich Men, Senators, honourable Counſellors; and ſo that Prophecy was fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. laſt. <hi>He made his Grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his Death.</hi> 2. They were good Men as well as rich Men; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, tho' ſecretly, for fear of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Grace doth not always make a publick and open ſhow where it is. As there is much ſecret Riches in the Bowels of the Earth, which no Eye ever ſaw, ſo there may be Grace in the Heart of a Chriſtian, which the World takes no notice of. We never heard any News of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> till now, yet was he eminently rich, wiſe and good; a Worthy, tho' a cloſe Diſciple. Much Grace may be where little is ſeen. Some Gracious Perſons cannot put forward, and diſcover themſelves like others; and yet ſuch weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians perhaps, when a Trial comes, ſhall ſtand their Ground, when ſtronger run away. We read of none of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles at Chriſt's Funeral; Fear had chaſed them away, tho' they profeſs'd a Readineſs to die with Chriſt: But <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> appear boldly for him. Let it be a Caution to ſtrong Chriſtians neither to glory in themſelves, nor to glory over the weak. If God deſert the ſtrong, and aſſiſt the weak, <hi>the feeble ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>and the ſtrong as Tow. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Mourners that followed the Hearſe; namely, the Women that follow'd him out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and particularly the Two <hi>Maries;</hi> a very poor Train of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a few ſorrowful Women. Others are attended to their Graves by their Relations and Friends, but Chriſt's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were all ſcattered, and afraid to own him either dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or dead. Our Bleſſed Lord affected no Pomp or Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in his Life, and it was no ways ſuitable either to the End or Manner of his Death. Humiliation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in his Death, and his Burial was the loweſt degree of his Humiliation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Grave or Sepulchre in which they buried him; <hi>it was in a Garden.</hi> As by the Sin of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were driven out of the Garden of Pleaſure, the Earthly Paradice; ſo by the Sufferings of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who lay buried in a Garden, we may hope for an Entrance into the Heavenly Paradice. It was in a <hi>Sepulchre hew'd out of a Rock;</hi> that ſo his Enemies might have no Occaſion to cavil, and ſay that his Diſciples ſtole him away by ſecret Holes, or unſeen Paſſages under Ground. And it was in a new Sepulchre, in which never any Man was laid, leſt his Adverſaries ſhould ſay it was ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was riſen, or that he roſe from the Dead by touching ſome other Corps. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Manner of our Lord's Funeral, haſtily, openly, decently. It was done in haſte, by reaſon of the Streights of Time, the Preparation for the Paſſover cauſed them to be very expeditious; the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was approaching, and they lay all Buſineſs aſide to prepare for that. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> How much it is our Duty to diſpatch our Worldly Buſineſs as early as we can towards the end of the Week, that we may be the better prepared to ſanctifie the Lord's Day, if we live to enjoy it. We ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Day before it come, and to ſanctifie it when it is come. Again, our Lord was buried openly, as well as haſtily; all Perſons had Liberty to be Spectators, that none might object there was any Fraud or Deceit uſed in or about his Burial. He was alſo interr'd decently, his Body wrapt in fine Linnen, and perfum'd with Odours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Jewiſh Cuſtom, which uſed not to unbowel, but embalm their Dead. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. The Reaſon why our Lord was buried, ſeeing he was to riſe again in as ſhort a time as other Men lye by the Walls; and had his dead Body remain'd a Thouſand Years unburied, it could have ſeen no Corruption, having never been tainted with Sin. Sin is the Cauſe of the Body's Corruption; 'tis Sin that makes our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtink worſe than Carrion when they are dead. A Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral then was not neceſſary for Chriſt's Body upon the ſame Accounts that it is neceſſary for ours. But, 1. He was buried to declare the Certainty of his Death, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Reſurrection, and for this Reaſon did God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence order it, that he ſhould be embalm'd, to cut off all Pretenſions. For in this kind of embalming, his Mouth, his Ears, and his Noſtrils, were all fill'd with Spices and Odours, ſo that there could be no Latent Principle of Life in him; being thus buried then, declares him to be certainly dead. 2. He was buried to fulfill the Types and Prophecies that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning him. <hi>Jonas</hi> being Three Days and Three Nights in the Belly of the Whale was a Type of Chriſt's being Three Days and Three Nights in the Heart of the Earth, and the Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.9. had declar'd the manner of his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral long before he was born. <hi>He made his Grave with the Wicked, and with the Rich in his Death.</hi> Pointing by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at this Tomb of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, who was a rich Man; <hi>and the Scriptures cannot be broken.</hi> 3. He was buried to compleat his Humiliation; <hi>They have brought me to the Duſt of Death,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi> a Type of Chriſt. This was the loweſt Step he could poſſibly deſcend in his abaſed ſtate; lower he could not be laid, and ſo low his bleſſed Head muſt be laid, elſe he had not been humbled to the loweſt. 4. He went into the Grave, that he might conquer Death in its own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and Dominions. Chriſt's Victory over the Grave cauſes his Saints to triumph and ſing, <hi>Oh Grave, where is thy Deſtruction?</hi> Our bleſſed Lord has perfum'd the Bed of the Grave by his own lying in it; ſo that a Pillow of Down is not ſo ſoft to a Believer's Head as a Pillow of Duſt. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> what Uſe the Doctrine of our Lord's Burial may be unto us. 1. For Inſtruction here we ſee the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Depths of our Lord's Humiliation. From what, to what his Love brought him; even from the Boſom of his Father, to the Boſom of the Grave. Now the Depth of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhews us the Fulneſs and Sufficiency of his Satisfaction, as well as the Heinouſneſs of our Tranſgreſſion. 2. For Conſolation againſt the Fears of Death and the Grave. The Grave received Chriſt, but could not retain him. Death ſwallow'd him up as the Fiſh did <hi>Jonas,</hi> but quickly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him up again; ſo ſhall it fare with Chriſt myſtical,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:46"/> as it did with Chriſt Perſonal; the Grave could not long keep him, it ſhall not for ever keep us; as his Body reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hope, ſo ſhall ours alſo; and tho' they ſee Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he did not, yet ſhall they not always lye under the Power of Corruption. <hi>In a Word.</hi> Chriſt's lying in the Grave has chang'd and alter'd the Nature of the Grave; it was a Priſon before, a Bed of Reſt now; a loathſome Grave before, a perfumed Bed now. He whoſe Head is in Heaven, need not fear to put his Foot into the Grave. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſing thou that dwelleſt in the Duſt,</hi> for the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Grave is ſlain by Chriſt. 3. For Imitation, let us ſtudy and endeavour to be buried with Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Sins. I mean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Buried with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death.</hi> Our Sins ſhould be as a dead Body, in ſeveral Reſpects. Are dead Bodies removed out of the Society of Men, ſo ſhould our Sins be removed far from us? Do dead Bodies in the Grave ſpend and conſume away by little and little? So ſhould our Sins daily. Will dead Bodies grow every Day more and more loathſome to others? So ſhould our Sins be to our ſelves. Do dead Bodies wax out of Memory, and are quite forgotten? So ſhould our Sins, in reſpect of any Delight that we take in remembring of them. We ſhould always remember our Sins to our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; but never think or ſpeak of them with the leaſt Delight or Satisfaction; for this in God's Account is a new Commiſſion of them, and lays under an Additional Guilt.</p>
               <p n="62">62 Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation, the chief Prieſts and Phariſees came together unto Pilate, 63 Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sir, we remember that that deceiver ſaid, while he was yet alive, After three days I will riſe again. 64 Command therefore that the ſepulchre be made ſure, until the third day, leſt his diſciples come by night, and ſteal him away, and ſay unto the people, he is riſen from the dead: ſo the laſt errour ſhall be worſe than the firſt. 65 Pilate ſaid unto them, Ye have a watch, go your way, make it as ſure as you can. 66 So they went, and made the ſepulchre ſure, ſealing the ſtone, and ſetting a watch.</p>
               <p>This laſt Paragraph of the Chapter acquaints us with the Endeavours that the Murtherers of Chriſt uſed to prevent his foretold Reſurrection: They ask and obtain of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that his Sepulchre may be ſtrongly guarded till the Third Day was paſt and over, when probably they intended to have expoſed his dead Body to the view of the People; and accordingly a threefold Guard is ſet about the Grave, the Stone, the Seal, and the Watch, concluding that Chriſt was ſafe enough, either for riſing or ſtealing: The Stone making the Grave ſure, the Seal making the Stone ſure, and the Watch or Band of Soldiers making all ſure. The Stone being ſealed with the publick Seal, no Perſon might meddle with it upon pain of Death. Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The wonderful Wiſdom, the over-ruling Power and Providence of God; by this exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Care and extraordinary Diligence the High Prieſts hoped to prevent our Saviour's Reſurrection, but the Truth and Belief of it was hereby confirmed to all the World. How much Evidence had Chriſt's Reſurrection wanted, if the High Prieſts and Elders had not been thus maliciouſly induſtrious to prevent his riſing. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the Endeavours uſed to obſtruct our Lord's Reſurrection have render'd it more certain and undoubted; had not all this Care and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on been uſed by his Enemies, the Grounds of our Faith had not been ſo ſtrong, ſo evident, and ſo clear. It was very happy, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were thus jealous and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, thus careful and diſtruſtful; for otherwiſe the World had never received ſo full and perfect an Evidence of Chriſt's Reſurrection as now, whereon all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Salvation doth depend. Verily their ſolicitous Care to ſuppreſs our Redeemer's Reſurrection has render'd it more conſpicuous, and freed it from all Suſpicion of Forgery.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p> This laſt Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> contains the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Reſurrection, and gives us an Account of what he did on Earth between the time of his Triumphant Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and his Glorious Aſcenſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 IN the end of the ſabbath, as it began to dawn, towards the firſt day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to ſee the ſepulchre.</p>
               <p>The Lord of Life was buried upon the <hi>Friday</hi> in the Evening of that Day on which he was crucified; and his holy Body reſted in the ſilent Grave, the next Day, and a part of the Morning the Day following. Thus he aroſe again the Third Day, neither ſooner nor later; not ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, leſt the Truth of his Death ſhould have been queſtion'd that he did not die at all; and not later, leſt the Faith of his Diſciples ſhould have fail'd. And accordingly, when the Sabbath was paſt, and <hi>it dawned towards the firſt Day of the Week, in the Morning very early,</hi> before Day, <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> and other devout Women, go to viſit the holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, intending, with their Spices and Odours, farther to imbalm our Lord's Body. But <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Altho' the Hearts of theſe good Women did burn with an Ardent Love and Zeal to their Crucified Lord, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duties of the Sabbath are not omitted by them; they ſtay till the Sabbath is ended, and then early in the Morning they go with Odours in their Hands to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume his Sacred Corps; fearing neither the Darkneſs of the Night, nor the Preſence of the Watchmen: How great a Tribute of Reſpect and Honour is due and paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to theſe Women for their Magnanimity and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. They follow'd Chriſt when his Diſciples left him; they accompanied him to his Croſs, and follow'd his Hearſe to the Grave, when none of his Diſciples durſt appear. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Courage is the ſpecial and peculiar Gift of God; and where God gives Courage, it is not in Man to make afraid.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And behold, there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord deſcended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door, and ſat upon it. 3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as ſnow. 4 And for fear of him the keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. With what Pomp and Triumph doth our Lord ariſe. The Earth that <hi>quaked</hi> before at his Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, <hi>quakes now again</hi> at his Reſurrection; it quak'd then at the Diſſolution, now at the Reunion of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, to tell the World that the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then ſuffer'd, and now conquer'd. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How an Angel is imploy'd in Chriſt's Reſurrection; <hi>He rolls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Stone.</hi> But could not Chriſt have riſen then without the Angel's Help? Yes ſure, he that raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſurely could have removed the Stone: But God thinks fit to ſend an Officer from Heaven to open the Priſon Door of the Grave, and by ſetting our Surety at Liberty, proclaims our Debt to the Divine Juſtice fully ſatisfied. Beſides, it was fit that the Angels who had been Witneſſes of our Saviour's Paſſion, ſhould alſo be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Reſurrection. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How unable the Keepers of the Grave were to bear the Sight and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Angel; <hi>they ſhake for Fear, and became as dead Men.</hi> Angels being pure and perfect Spirits, Man is not able to bear the Sight of an Angel, no, not in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Shape, without Terror and Affrightment; and if the Sight of an Angel be ſo dreadful, what is the Sight of God himſelf?</p>
               <p n="5">5 And the angel anſwered and ſaid unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye ſeek Jeſus which was crucified. 6 He is not here:
<pb facs="tcp:46556:46"/> for he is riſen: as he ſaid; come, ſee the place where the Lord lay. 7 And go quickly, and tell his diſciples that he is riſen from the dead; and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee, there ſhall ye ſee him, lo, I have told you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Our Lord's Reſurrection aſſerted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, <hi>He is riſen.</hi> God never intended that the darling of his Soul ſhould be loſt in an obſcure Sepulchre; <hi>he is not here,</hi> ſays the Angel; that is, in the Grave, <hi>where you laid him,</hi> where you left him. Death has loſt its Prey, and the Grave has loſt her Gueſt. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. It is not ſaid, He is not here, for he is raiſed, <hi>but he is riſen.</hi> The Word imports the active Power of Chriſt, or the ſelf-quickning Principle by which Chriſt raiſed himſelf from the Dead. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. <hi>He ſhewed himſelf active after his Paſſion, Learn,</hi> That it was the Divine Nature or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt which raiſed his Humane Nature from Death to Life. Others were raiſed from the Grave by Chriſt's Power, he raiſed himſelf by his own Power. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 3. The Teſtimony or Witneſs given to our Lord's Reſurrection; that of an Angel, <hi>The Angel ſaid he is not here, but riſen.</hi> But why is an Angel the firſt Publiſher of our Lord's Reſurrection? Surely the Dignity of our Lord's Perſon, and the Excellency of his Reſurrection required that it ſhould be firſt publiſhed by an Angel; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it is worthy our Obſervation, how very ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and officious the holy Angels were in attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour in the Days of his Fleſh; an Angel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells his <hi>Conception to the Bleſſed Virgin;</hi> an Angel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims his <hi>Birth to the Shepherds;</hi> an Angel ſuccours him <hi>in his Temptations in the Wilderneſs;</hi> an Angel comforts him <hi>in his Agony in the Garden;</hi> and at his Reſurrection <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel rolls away the Stone from the Sepulchre,</hi> and <hi>brings the firſt Tydings of it to the Women.</hi> In his Aſcenſion the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>bore him Company to Heaven;</hi> and when he comes again to Judgment, <hi>he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels. Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Perſons to whom our Lord's Reſurrection was firſt made known, <hi>to Women,</hi> to the <hi>Two Maries:</hi> But why to the Women? God will make Choice of weak Means for producing great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, knowing that the Weakneſs of the Inſtrument redounds to the greater Honour of the Agent. In the whole Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel Almighty God intermixes Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with Humane Weakneſs. Thus the Conception of Chriſt was by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt; but his Mother, a poor Woman, a Carpenter's Spouſe: So the Crucifixion of Chriſt was in much Meanneſs and outward Baſeneſs, being crucified between Two Thieves: But the Powers of Heaven and Earth trembling, the Rocks rending, and the Graves opening, ſhew'd a mixture of Divine Power. God will honour what Inſtruments he pleaſes, for the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Purpoſes. But why to theſe Women, the Two <hi>Maries,</hi> is this Diſcovery of Chriſt's Reſurrection firſt made? Poſſibly it was a Reward for their Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Maſculine Courage. Theſe Women clave to Chriſt when the Apoſtles fled from him, and forſook him; they aſſiſted at his Croſs, they attended at his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they watched his Sepulchre. Theſe Women had more Courage than the Apoſtles, therefore God makes the Women Apoſtles to the Apoſtles; he ſends them to tell the Apoſtles of the Reſurrection, and they muſt have the News at the ſecond Hand. Oh what a tacit Rebuke was hereby given to the Apoſtles! A ſecret Check, that they ſhould be thus outdone by poor Women. Theſe holy Women went before the Apoſtles in the laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that were done for Chriſt, and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles here come after them in their Rewards and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 5. The Evidence which the Angel offers to the Women, to evince and prove the Verity and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our Saviour's Reſurrection; namely, by an Appeal to their Senſes. <hi>Come ſee the Place where the Lord lay.</hi> The Senſes, when rightly diſpoſed, are the proper Judges of all ſenſible Objects; therefore Chriſt himſelf did appeal to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Senſes concerning the Truth of his own Reſurrection. <hi>Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my ſelf;</hi> and indeed, if we muſt not believe our Senſes, we ſhall want the beſt External Evidence for the Proof of the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; namely, the Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: For what Aſſurance can we have of the Reality of thoſe Miracles, but from our Senſes? Therefore ſays our Saviour, <hi>If ye believe not me, yet believe the Works that I do.</hi> That is, the Miracles which I have wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Eyes. Now as my Senſes tell me that Chriſt's Miracles were true, ſo they aſſure me that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is falſe. From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the Omnipotent Power of his Godhead, revived and roſe again from the Dead, to the Terror and Conſternation of his Enemies, and the unſpeakable Joy and Conſolation of Believers.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And they departed quickly from the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, with fear and great joy, and did run to bring his diſciples word. 9 And as they went to tell his diſciples, behold, Jeſus met them, ſaying, All hail. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worſhipped him. 10 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there ſhall they ſee me.</p>

What Haſte and Speed theſe holy Women make to carry the News of Chriſt's Reſurrection to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; ſuch as find and feel their Hearts grieved for the Abſence and Want of Chriſt, will be very ready to comfort ſuch as are in the ſame Condition. Oh how glad are theſe holy Women to carry the good News of their Lord's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to the Heart-broken Diſciples. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How theſe holy Women haſting in Obedience to the Angel's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to tell the Diſciples, do meet with Chriſt in the way. Such as obey the Directions of God's Miniſters, ſeeking Chriſt in his own Way and Means, ſhall find him to their Comfort ſooner than they expected. Theſe holy Women find Chriſt before they look'd for him; <hi>as they went to tell his Diſciples, Jeſus met them. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The affectionate and loving Title which Chriſt puts upon his Diſciples. <hi>Tell my Brethren.</hi> He might have ſaid, Go tell thoſe Apoſtate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that cowardly left me in my Danger, that durſt not own me in the High Prieſt's Hall, that durſt not come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Shadow of my Croſs, nor within the Sight of my Sepulchre. Not a word of this by way of upbraiding them for their late ſhameful Cowardice, but all Words of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Go tell my Brethren.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> That Chriſt calls his Diſciples <hi>Brethren</hi> after his Reſurrection and Exaltation, as he had done before in his State of Humiliation, to ſhew the Continuance of his former Affection to them, and that the Change of his Condition had wrought no Change in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards his deſpiſed Members: But thoſe that were his Brethren before in the time of his Abaſement are ſo ſtill after his Exaltation and Advancement. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> The Place where Chriſt chuſes to meet with and ſpeak to his Diſciples, not in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in <hi>Galilee. I go before them into</hi> Galilee, <hi>there ſhall they ſee me. Jeruſalem</hi> was now a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Place, a People abandoned to Deſtruction; Chriſt would not ſhew himſelf openly to them, but <hi>Galilee</hi> was a Place where Chriſt's Miniſtry was more acceptable. Such Places wherein Chriſt is moſt welcome to preach, ſhall be moſt honoured with his Preſence. <hi>In</hi> Galilee <hi>ſhall they ſee me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 Now when they were going, behold, ſome of the watch came into the city, and ſhewed unto the chief Prieſts all the things that were done. 12 And when they were aſſembled with the elders, and had taken counſel, they gave large money unto the ſoldiers, 13 Saying, ſay ye, His diſciples came by night, and ſtole him away while we ſlept. 14 And if this come to the governours ears, we will perſwade him, and ſecure you. 15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this ſaying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Prieſts and Elders endeavour by a notorious Lie to hinder the Belief of our Lord's Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; they ſuborn and bribe the Soldiers to ſay that his Corps were ſtoln out of the Grave. Lies have been an old Refuge, which the Enemies of Chriſt have all along had Recourſe unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lying is an ancient Device of Satan. But
<pb facs="tcp:46556:47"/> 
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. What an improbable and unlikely Lie this was, which they put into the Soldiers Mouths to vouch; <hi>Say, his Diſciples came and ſtole him away while we ſlept.</hi> If the Soldiers were aſleep, how could they diſcover the Diſciples ſtealing away the Body? If awake, why did they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſtealing it? Beſides, how improbable was it that Chriſt's few and fearful Diſciples ſhould attempt to open the Sepulchre, guarded by Soldiers? And as unlikely was it that the Soldiers ſhould be all aſleep together, and ſo faſt aſleep too, that the great Stone at the Mouth of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre ſhould be rolled away, and not one of the Soldiers awaked with the Noiſe. Yet <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, That this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Falſhood finds a faſt and firm rooting in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the <hi>Jews</hi> to this Day. <hi>Note thence,</hi> That it is a Righteous Thing with God to deliver up to thoſe ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, even to the believing of notorious Lies, who will not yield their Aſſent to Divine Truths upon the cleareſt Evidence, and moſt convincing Demonſtration. How ſtrange is it, that ſuch a Falſhood as this ſhould find Belief amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to this Day? But where Truth is obſtinately reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Lie, tho' never ſo improbable, is received.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Then the eleven diſciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain, where Jeſus had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them. 17 And when they ſaw him, they worſhipped him: but ſome doubted.</p>
               <p>This Meeting of our Saviour and his Apoſtles upon a Mountain in <hi>Galilee</hi> was an appointed and general Meeting. The Mountain is ſuppoſed to be that near <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he made that famous Sermon, called <hi>the Sermon on the Mount;</hi> and the Meeting is ſuppoſed to be appointed as a general Rendezvous for confirming the Faith of all his Diſciples in the Certainty of his Reſurrection. Poſſibly our Lord appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Place in <hi>Galilee</hi> ſo far from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples might without Danger come thither to ſee their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alive again after his Crucifixion. This is judged to be that famous Appearance, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. <hi>When he was ſeen of above Five Hundred Brethren at once.</hi> And thoſe that ſaw him worſhipped him who before had doubted. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That when Faith is once ſatisfied, and ſees Chriſt to be God, it engages the Soul to worſhip him. Divine Worſhip is due to Chriſt upon the Account of his Divine Nature. No Creature can be the Object of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, therefore they that worſhip Chriſt by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and yet deny him to be God, are certainly Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. If Chriſt had had an Angelick Nature, that had not made him capable of Divine Worſhip; for Adoration is founded only in Divinity, and what is but Humane or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, is not Adorable.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 19 Go ye therefore and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt: 20 Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world: Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A Power aſſerted. 2. An Authority dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. 3. A Command injoined. 4. A Promiſe ſubjoined. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. A Power and Authority aſſerted by our Saviour as belonging to himſelf; <hi>All Power is given to me both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in Earth.</hi> 1. <hi>In Heaven;</hi> which comprehends a Power of ſending the Holy Ghoſt; a Power over the Angels, and all the Hoſt of Heaven; and a Power to diſpoſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all that ſhall believe in him. 2. <hi>In Earth;</hi> which comprehends a Power to gather a Church out of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Authority to rule, govern and defend the ſame againſt all its Enemies. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That all Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority concerning the Church of God; was given unto Chriſt, and conferr'd upon him, upon the Account of his Meritorious Death and Triumphant Reſurrection. <hi>All Power is given to me.</hi> That is, as Mediator; but this Power was inherent in him as God from all Eternity. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. This Power delegated by Chriſt to his Apoſtles; <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and teach, and baptize all Nations, inſtructing them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things whatſoever I command you.</hi> Here is a threefold Power delegated by Chriſt to his Apoſtles. 1. To congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and gather a Church, a Chriſtian Church, out of all the Heathen Nations throughout the World. Before he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined them only to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now they muſt travel from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to Country, and proſelyte the Heathen Nations, which before had been taught of the Devil, and were led away by his Oracles and Deluſions. <hi>Go and diſciple all Nations,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Diſtinction of Country, Sex or Age whatſoever, and make the Goſpel Church as large as you can. Thence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Apoſtles and firſt Planters of the Goſpel had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt to go amongſt the Pagan-Gentiles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Limitation; and were not to take up their ſettled Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any one Nation, but to travel from Country to Country, inſtructing them in the ſaving Myſteries of the Goſpel. The ſecond Branch of their Power was to baptize in the Name of the whole Trinity, <hi>Baptizing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That all adult and grown Perſons are to be firſt taught and inſtructed before they be baptized. But it follows not from hence, that the Children of ſuch Parents may not be baptized before they are taught; for the Apoſtles were to baptize all Nations, of which Children are a chief, if not the chiefeſt part. Beſides thoſe that were proſelyted to the Jewiſh Religion, tho' before they were circumciſed themſelves, they were inſtructed in the Law of God; yet when they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed themſelves, their Children were not denied Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion at Eight Days old. In like manner have we no Reaſon to deny the Children of baptized Parents, who are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant themſelves, the Sign and Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm, God having aſſured his People, that <hi>he will be the God of them, and of their Seed.</hi> If this Priviledge be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, the Children of Chriſtian Parents are in a worſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and conſequently Infants are in a worſe Condition ſince Chriſt's coming, than they were before, and the Priviledges of thoſe that live under the Goſpel are ſtreighter and narrower than thoſe that lived under the Law. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, In whoſe Name Perſons are to be baptized; <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> Where we have a Profeſſion of our Belief in the holy Trinity, a Dedication of the Perſon to the Worſhip and Service of the holy Trinity, and a Stipulation or Covenant Promiſe that we will continue faithful in the Service of Father, Son, and holy Spirit to our Lives end. The third Branch of the Power which Chriſt delegated to his Apoſtles was by their Miniſtry to preſs upon all their Converts an Univerſal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of, and Obedience to all his Commands. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I command you.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That preaching is the ordinary and inſtituted Means to convert Nations unto God. 2. That preaching muſt not only go before Baptiſm, but follow after it. Obedience muſt be preſt upon, and practiſed by all thoſe that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with God; otherwiſe they lye under a greater Condemnation. 3. That preaching the Goſpel is a chief part of the Miniſters Work, and no Apoſtle thought himſelf above that Duty. 4. As the Apoſtles did not, ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt ought not to teach any thing but what Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them. 5. As they are to teach what Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, ſo are they to teach all things whatſoever Chriſt commands them; <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I command you.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The Promiſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined; <hi>Lo I am with you always to the end of the World.</hi> That is, I am and will be with you and your Succeſſors lawfully called by my Power and Authority, by the Bleſſing and Aſſiſtance of my holy Spirit: I will be with you, to uphold my own Ordinance, to protect, encourage, and reward you and all your Succeſſors in the faithful Diſcharge of your Truſt; and this not for a Day, a Year, or an Age, but to the End and Conſummation of all Ages. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Miniſtry of the Word, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, are a ſtanding and perpetual Ordinance, to continue in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church throughout all Ages. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt, in what part of the World ſoever God ſhall caſt their Lot, and in what time ſoever they ſhall happen to live, may comfortably expect Chriſt's Gracious Preſence with their Perſons, and his Bleſſing upon their Endeavours. <hi>Lo, I am with you,</hi> I am <hi>always</hi> with you, <hi>and to the end of the World I will be with you.</hi> Thanks be to Chriſt for the Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Spiritual and Perpetual Preſence with his Miniſters to the end of the World. May this Promiſe cauſe us to gird up the Loins of our Minds, encreaſe our Diligence, Zeal and Fervour, accounting no Labour too great, no Service too much, no Sufferings too ſevere, ſo that <hi>we may but finiſh our Courſe with Joy, and fulfil the Miniſtry we are engaged in.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p n="1">1 THE beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God.</p>
               <p>The Word <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſignifies a Meſſage of glad Tydings, and intimates to us, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel contains the moſt gladſome Tydings, the moſt joyful Meſſage that ever was ſent from God to Mankind: Happy Tydings concerning our Reconciliation with God, and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. Oh how highly ſhould we prize, how ſtedfaſtly believe, how cordially embrace theſe good Tydings of great Joy! <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. This Goſpel is called the <hi>Goſpel of Jeſus Christ,</hi> becauſe Chriſt, as God, is the Author of this Goſpel, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the principal Subject and Matter of it: Indeed St. <hi>John the Baptist</hi> was the firſt Publiſher and Preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Doctrine, but Chriſt himſelf was the firſt and principal Author, and likewiſe the chief Subject-matter of it; for whatever is taught in the Goſpel, relates either to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Offices of Chriſt, or to the Benefits received by him, or the Means of enjoying thoſe Benefits from him. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. How St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſtiles Chriſt <hi>the Son of God,</hi> as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had ſtiled him before the Son of <hi>David;</hi> the one ſets forth the Verity of his Humane Nature, the other the Reality of his Divine Nature. Signifying to us, that the true and promiſed Meſſias was both God and Man in two diſtinct Natures, and one Perſon for ever. He is true and real God, as well as the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; not a meer Man, but God as well as Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Mark</hi> begins his Goſpel with an Account of St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's Preaching and Miniſtry; and declares, 1. That the Prophets of old, particularly <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> did long before foretel the Baptiſt's Meſſage and Miniſtry; that he ſhould go before Chriſt as his Harbinger, to prepare the Way for him: <hi>Behold, I ſend my Meſſenger to prepare thy Way.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The Dignity and Authority of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt; they are his <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> ſent by him to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Mind and Will unto his People. This Miniſterial Miſſion is twofold; Extraordinary, and Ordinary; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when God immediately by himſelf calls Men to the Holy Function; the latter, when he uſes the Miniſtry of Man in order thereunto. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Work and Office of the Miniſters of Chriſt declared, and that is, to prepare People to receive Jeſus Chriſt offered and tendered to them in the Goſpel. <hi>Behold, I ſend my Meſſenger to prepare thy Way before thee. Learn</hi> thence, That the great Deſign and End of the Miniſtry of the Word, is to prepare and fit Men for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Holy Religion of Chriſt in their Hearts, and to oblige them to walk according to the Rules and Directions of it in their Lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The Title given to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: He is called <hi>a Voice,</hi> in reſpect of his Miniſterial Office, which was to ſpeak forth, to promulge and publiſh the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 2. The Quality or Kind of this Voice, a <hi>crying</hi> Voice, <hi>the Voice of one crying.</hi> This implies, 1. His Earneſtneſs and Vehemency; his Zeal and Fervency in Preaching. When we lift up our Voice, and cry aloud, we ſpeak with Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fervour. When our own Hearts are warmly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what we preach, we may hope to affect the Hearts of our Hearers. Why has God commiſſioned Men, rather than Angels, to be the Preachers and Diſpenſers of his Word? But becauſe we can ſpeak to, and treat with Sinners more feelingly, and more affectionately than the Angels can. 2. This crying of the Holy Baptiſt in his Preaching implies his Liberty and Boldneſs, as well as his Vehemency and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs in delivering of his Meſſage. The lifting up of the Voice in ſpeaking, argues Boldneſs and Courage in the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as on the contrary, the depreſſing of the Voice ſheweth Timerouſneſs. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Miniſters of the Word are to uſe both Zeal and Earneſtneſs, and alſo Courage and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:49"/> Boldneſs of Spirit, in delivering the Word and Meſſage of God. Not forbearing to reprove Sin, nor concealing any part of God's Truth, for fear of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Sum and Subſtance of what he cried, <hi>Prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make his Paths ſtraight.</hi> That is, Make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy your ſelves, prepare your own Hearts to entertain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and glad Tydings of the Goſpel.

We have naturally no Fitneſs, no Diſpoſition, no Inclination, to believe in him, or to ſubmit unto him. 2. If ever we deſire to entertain Chriſt in our Hearts, we muſt firſt prepare and make fit our Hearts for the receiving and embracing of him. For tho' <hi>the Preparation of the Heart be from the Lord,</hi> yet he requires the Exerciſe of our Faculties, and the Uſe of our Endeavours. He prepares our Hearts, by enabling us to the Preparation of our own Hearts. This is done, by getting a ſight of the Evil of Sin, a ſenſe of our Miſery without Chriſt, an hungring and thirſting Deſire after him, a true Faith in him. Chriſt will lodge in no Heart that is not thus made ready to receive him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 John did baptize in the wilderneſs, and preach the baptiſm of repentance, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>A twofold Account is here given of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Execution of his Miniſtry and Office; <hi>firſt,</hi> his Baptizing; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> his Preaching. <hi>John did Baptize:</hi> That is, admit Perſons into the Church, by waſhing them with Water. <hi>John</hi> baptized into the Name of Chriſt, who was to come; the Apoſtles baptized into the Name of Chriſt, already come. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of his Office was Preaching; where <hi>Note,</hi> That Preaching of the Word, and Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are to go together, and belong only to the Miniſters of the Word, lawfully called. <hi>John did Baptize and Preach;</hi> but where and what did he preach? The place where, was the Wilderneſs; a place not much frequented, tho' not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uninhabited; a ſolitary, mean, and obſcure place. Thither God had called him, and there he contents himſelf. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Miniſters of God muſt be content to execute their Miniſtry where God calls them, be the Place never ſo mean and obſcure, and the People never ſo rude and barbarous: <hi>John</hi> was a Preacher of great Note and Fame, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the chief City might ſeem more fit for him, but God had called him to Preach in the Wilderneſs, and he would not leave it. We muſt not leave our Place becauſe it is mean and obſcure, nor deſert our People, thinking them too baſe to inſtruct; but where God has called us, we muſt there abide, till he that call'd us thither remove us thence. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, as the Place where the Baptiſt preach'd, <hi>in the Wilderneſs;</hi> ſo the Doctrine which he preach'd, namely, <hi>the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin:</hi> That is, the Doctrine of Baptiſm, which ſealeth Remiſſion of Sins to the Party baptized. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Preaching of the Doctrine of Repentance is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, and the Indiſpenſible Duty of every Goſpel-Miniſter. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt preach'd it, our Saviour preach'd it, his Apoſtles preach'd it. <hi>They went out Preaching every where, that Men ſhould repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of Jeruſalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confeſſing their ſins.</p>
               <p>Here we have an Account of the Succeſs of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry; 1. In the general Concourſe and Reſort of the People to it. <hi>All Judea and Jeruſalem;</hi> that is, a great many of all Degrees and Ranks, of Ages and Sexes. <hi>John</hi> was famed for a Prophet, and a Prophet was now a great Rarity. <hi>Malachy</hi> was the laſt Prophet before <hi>John,</hi> and he lived about Five Hundred Years before <hi>John.</hi> Now the Excellency of his Perſon, the Earneſtneſs of his Preaching, the Acceptableneſs of his Doctrine, that the Meſſias was come, and the Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Life and Converſation; all theſe cauſed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to flock unto him. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That it is a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Miniſters of Chriſt, when People ſhew themſelves ready and forward to repair unto the Places where the Word and Sacraments are diſpenſed to them: <hi>All Judea and Jeruſalem</hi> attended upon <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry. The ſecond Fruit of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry was, that the People were ready to receive at his Hand the Sacrament of Baptiſm; <hi>They were all baptized of him in Jordan. Learn</hi> hence, That the Miniſters of Chriſt ought not only to preach the Word, but alſo to diſpenſe the Sacraments to their People, even to all that do deſire them, and are fit to be Partakers of them. A third Fruit of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry was his Hearers Profeſſion of their true Repentance by the <hi>Confeſſion of their Sins:</hi> As the Profeſſion of Repentance is requiſite in all that are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſo a free and voluntary, ingenious and impartial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sin, is a good Evidence and Teſtimony of the Truth and Sincerity of our Repentance.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And John was cloathed with camels hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins: and he did eat locuſts, and wild honey.</p>
               <p>This Verſe acquaints us with the Strictneſs and Auſterity of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Life in the Wilderneſs, which is laid down in two Things, in his mean and frugal Apparel, and in his ſober and temperate Diet. His Apparel was rough and <hi>hairy,</hi> and his <hi>Girdle of Leather;</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> his Forerunner was clad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.8. His Diet was courſe and ordinary, <hi>Locuſts and wild Honey;</hi> that is, ſuch plain and ordinary Food as the Wilderneſs afforded. His Example teaches us, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are not to affect either Bravery in Apparel, or Delicacy in Diet, but both by their Habit and Diet ſet an Example of Gravity and Sobriety before their People; being in theſe as well as in other things an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto their Flocks.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And preached, ſaying, There cometh one mightier then I after me, the latchet of whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to ſtoop down and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. The high Opinion that the Baptiſt had of Chriſt; <hi>he is mightier than I:</hi> That is, a Perſon of greater Dignity and Excellency by far than my ſelf; whence may be gathered, that tho' Chriſt was Man, he was not meer Man, but more than Man; even very God, equal with the Father; for <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was <hi>the greateſt of them that were born of Women, Matth.</hi> 11.11. yet ſays he, <hi>Christ is mightier, or greater than I.</hi> How ſo? but in regard of the Dignity of his Perſon, being both God and Man in two diſtinct Natures, and one Perſon. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 2. The humble and low Eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Baptiſt had of himſelf; <hi>His Shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe:</hi> A proverbial Speech, implying, that he was unworthy to do the baſeſt and meaneſt Service for Chriſt. Oh how well doth Humility of Mind, an humble Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a low Eſteem and Opinion of themſelves, and their own Gifts and Abilities, become the Meſſengers and Miniſters of Chriſt <hi>John</hi> was a Man of eminent Abilities, yet of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Humility; he thought himſelf unworthy to unlooſe Chriſt's Shoe, or do the meaneſt Office for him.</p>
               <p n="8">8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> ſhewed the Dignity of Chriſt's Perſon above his own in the former Verſe; in this he declares the Excellency of Chriſt's Office, and the meanneſs of his own; I waſh the Body with Water, but Chriſt cleanſes the Soul by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Holy Spirit. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That tho' the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt do by Chriſt's Command diſpence the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance of Baptiſm, yet it is Chriſt himſelf, that by the Inward Work of his Spirit doth make it effectual to ſuch as receive it. <hi>I Baptize with Water,</hi> but <hi>he with the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 And it came to paſs in thoſe days, that Jeſus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of John in Jordan. 10 And ſtraightway coming up out of the water, he ſaw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove deſcending upon him. 11 And there came a voice from heaven, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:49"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>See the Note on Matth.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> here 1. The great Condeſcention of Chriſt, in ſeeking and ſubmitting to the Baptiſm of <hi>John:</hi> Chriſt, tho' he was <hi>John</hi>'s Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, yea, Lord of Heaven and Earth, yet cometh to hear <hi>John</hi> Preach, and will be Baptized of his Meſſenger. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the greateſt Perſons ſhould neither think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too great, nor too good to come unto the Miniſters of God, to hear the Word from his Mouth, or to receive the Sacrament at his Hand. Chriſt, the Son of God, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be Baptized of <hi>John,</hi> a mean Perſon in Compariſon of himſelf. How dare then the greateſt upon Earth deſpiſe the Miniſtry of Man, being appointed by God? <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The ſolemn inveſting of Chriſt into the Office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by a threefold Miracle; namely, the opening of the Heavens, the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, and God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Voice or Teſtimony concerning his Son: <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened,</hi> to ſhew that Heaven which was cloſed and ſhut againſt us for our Sins, is now opened to us by Chriſt's undertaking for us. As Chriſt opened Heaven by his merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Paſſion, ſo he keeps it open by his prevailing Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. <hi>Next, The Holy Ghoſt deſcends like a Dove upon our Saviour.</hi> Here we have a Proof and Evidence of the Bleſſed Trinity. The Father ſpeaks from Heaven, the Son comes out of the Water, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcends in the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Dove. But why did the Holy Ghoſt now deſcend upon Chriſt? <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Deſignation of his Perſon, to ſhew that he was the Perſon ſet apart for the Work and Office of a Mediator. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Sanctification of his Perſon for the Performance of that Office. This was Chriſt's Unction, the Day in which he was Anointed above his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be the King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, he hath anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Voice of God the Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, 1. The Nearneſs of Chriſt's Relation to himſelf; <hi>This is my Son.</hi> 2. The Endearedneſs of his Perſon; <hi>This is my Beloved Son.</hi> 3. The Fruit and Benefit of this near and dear Relation unto us; <hi>In him I am well pleaſed.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That there is no Poſſibility for any Perſon to pleaſe God out of Chriſt, neither our Perſons nor our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances can find Acceptance, but thro' him, and for his ſake. 2. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Ground and Cauſe of all that Love which God the Father ſheweth to the Sons of Men: In Chriſt God is well pleaſed with us as a reconciled Father; out of him a conſuming Fire.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And immediately the ſpirit driveth him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilderneſs. 13 And he was there in the wilderneſs forty days tempted of Satan, and was with the wild beaſts, and the Angels miniſtred unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immediately.</hi> That is, 1. After his Baptiſm. Chriſt is no ſooner out of the Water of Baptiſm, but he is in the Fire of Temptation: Such as are Baptized with Chriſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, they muſt look to be aſſaulted with Satan's Temptations. Again, <hi>Immediately,</hi> that is, 2. After the Father had declared his Complacency in him, and being well pleaſed with him. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That great Manifeſtations of Love from God, are uſually followed with great Temptations from Satan. <hi>The Spirit driveth him;</hi> That is, the Holy Spirit of God. For the Devil is ſeldom, if ever, called the Spirit, but uſually ſome Brand of Reproach is annexed, as the evil Spirit, or the unclean Spirit, and the like. <hi>Chriſt was led by the Spirit,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 4.1. <hi>He was driven by the Spirit,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Mark;</hi> that is, He was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a ſtrong Impulſe of the Spirit of God, to be tempted by Satan, and did not go of his own private Motion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Liſts with Satan. <hi>Teaching</hi> us our Duty, not to run into, or ruſh upon Temptations without a Warrant and Call from God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the Place where Satan aſſaulted Chriſt with his Temptations; it was a ſolitary Wilderneſs. No Place can priviledge us from Temptations, or be a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary from Satan's Aſſaults. The ſolitary Wilderneſs has a Tempter in it, yea, Satan oft-times makes uſe of Men's Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs, to farther his Temptations; and ſuch as ſeparate themſelves from Humane Society, and give themſelves up to Solitude and Retirement, they give great Advantage to the Tempter to tempt them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the Time and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our Holy Lord's Temptations; not for an Hour, a Day, a Week, or a Month, but for <hi>Forty Days, and Forty Nights;</hi> not all the Time, but very often in that Time. <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> us what we are to expect from Satan; Temptations, not a few; he will not ſolicite us once, but often, and follow us with freſh Aſſaults; but the only way to overcome him, is as often to reſiſt him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, a ſpecial Aggravation of our Lord's Temptations in the Wilderneſs, <hi>He was with the wild Beaſts,</hi> having no Comfort from Man, but only wild Beaſts for his Companions, which were more likely to annoy and hurt him, than any way to help and comfort him. Here we have an Evidence of the Divine Power of Chriſt; who, as Lord of the Creatures, can alter and change the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Creatures at his Pleaſure, reſtraining the moſt Savage and Hurtful Beaſts from hurting, either himſelf, or any of his People. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> laſtly, The Supply ſent in to Chriſt in the Hour of Temptation. <hi>The Angels came and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto him,</hi> Food to his hungry Body, and Comfort to his tempted Soul. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, that thoſe who in the Hour of Temptation do hold out in reſiſting Satan, ſhall find, that the Power and Faithfulneſs of God will not be wanting to them, to ſend in Succour and Relief at laſt. <hi>Then the Devil leaveth him, and behold Angels came and miniſtred unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 Now after that John was put in priſon, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came into Galilee, preaching the goſpel of the kingdom of God, 15 And ſaying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye, and believe the goſpel.</p>
               <p>In this our Saviour's firſt beginning to preach the Goſpel, we have an Account of the Time when, the Place where, and the Sum of what he preached. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 1. The Time when our Lord began to preach, and that was <hi>after John the Baptiſt was caſt into Priſon:</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The undue Reward which the Miniſters of God do ſometimes meet with from a wicked World: They are hated, perſecuted, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, for their Courage in reproving Sin: <hi>John</hi> for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Herod</hi>'s Inceſt, was put in Priſon. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. <hi>John</hi> was no ſooner in Priſon, and ſtopt, and hindered from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Chriſt began to preach. See the Care and Kindneſs of God towards his Church, in that he never leaves it wholly deſtitute of the Means of Inſtruction: When ſome of his faithful Miniſters are reſtrained from preaching, he ſtirreth up others in their Rooms, not ſuffering all their Mouths to be ſtopt at once. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Place where our Lord firſt preached in <hi>Galilee.</hi> The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in our Saviour's time was divided into three principal Provinces. On the South, <hi>Judea;</hi> on the North, <hi>Galilee;</hi> in the midſt, <hi>Samaria. Galilee</hi> was divided into the upper and lower <hi>Galilee;</hi> the higher was called <hi>Galilee</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe it was the outmoſt part of the Land, and ſo next unto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> In this upper <hi>Galilee, Capernaum</hi> was the Metropolis, or Chief, and <hi>Corazin,</hi> a leſſer City. Now much of our Saviour's time was ſpent in <hi>Galilee;</hi> he was conceived and brought up at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a City in <hi>Galilee;</hi> he firſt preached at <hi>Capernaum</hi> in <hi>Galilee;</hi> he wrought the firſt Miracle at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee.</hi> His Transfiguration was upon Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and our Saviour's ordinary Reſidence was in <hi>Galilee;</hi> he came into <hi>Judea,</hi> and up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only at the Feaſts, and after his Reſurrection he appoints his Diſciples to meet him in <hi>Galilee.</hi> Only his Nativity, his Paſſion, and Aſcenſion, were proper to <hi>Judea:</hi> His Nativity at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> his Paſſion at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his Aſcenſion upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> hard by <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now all this demonſtrates Chriſt to be the true and promiſed Meſſias; for according to Prophecy the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to have his Preſence and principal Abode in the Province of <hi>Galilee, Iſa.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet becauſe he was of <hi>Galilee,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> would not believe him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſaying in Scorn, <hi>Can any good thing come out of</hi> Galilee? Whereas our Saviour's Habitation and free Converſation there was a Proof unto them, and ought to have perſwaded them, that according to Prophecy he was the very Chriſt. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Sum of what our Lord preached, namely, a Doctrine, and an Exhortation. His Doctrine is, <hi>That the Time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at Hand.</hi> That is, that the Time foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould begin, was now come. The Exhortation is, <hi>Therefore Repent, and Believe the Goſpel.</hi> From the former, <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s coming, or our Saviour's appearing in the Fleſh, was exactly at the time foretold by the Holy Prophets. <hi>The time is fulfilled, the Kingdom of the Meſſiah is at Hand. Note,</hi> 2. That the great Doctrines of Repentance and Faith are taught only in and by the Goſpel, and accordingly ought in a ſpecial Manner to be preach'd, and inſiſted upon by the Miniſters of the Goſpel.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:50"/> The Doctrine of Chriſt and his Ambaſſador is and ought to be the ſame; they both teach the great Doctrines of Faith and Repentance to a loſt World. <hi>Repent, and Believe the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 Now as he walked by the ſea of Galilee, he ſaw Simon and Andrew his brother, caſting a net into the ſea: (for they were fiſhers.) 17 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fiſhers of men. 18 And ſtraightway they forſook their nets, and followed him. 19 And when he had gone a little further thence, he ſaw James the ſon of Zebedee, and John his brother, who alſo were in the ſhip mending their nets. 20 And ſtraightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ſhip with the hired ſervants, and went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
               <p>In this Hiſtory of our Saviour's calling the four Diſciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew, James</hi> and <hi>John, Obſerve</hi> theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The Meanneſs of the Perſons whom he calls, Illiterate <hi>Fiſhermen:</hi> Chriſt took hereby effectual Care, that his Goſpel ſhould be known to be the Power of God, and not the Wiſdom and Device of Man; and that the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould not carry away the Glory of the Work. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Chriſt called his Apoſtles by Couples, <hi>Two and Two;</hi> firſt <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> then <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> thereby ſignifying to us, that the Work of the Miniſtry requires the Concurrence of all Hands that are called to it. All the Miniſters of God ſhould join their Hearts and Hands, and ſet their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as one Man to this great Work, and all little enough (God knows) to carry it on with Advantage and Succeſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Work which they are called from, and called to, from being <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> to be <hi>Fiſhers of Men;</hi> from catching Fiſh with the Labour of their Hands, to catch Men with the Labour of their Tongues. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, firſt to follow him before they be ſent out by him: <hi>Follow me, and I will make you Fiſhers of Men.</hi> We muſt be Chriſt's Diſciples before we are his Miniſters; his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, before we are his Ambaſſadors: We muſt learn Chriſt, before we preach him; otherwiſe we may fiſh for a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but not for Souls. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Gracious Promiſe which Chriſt gives his Apoſtles for their Encouragement, namely, to qualifie them for, and to ſucceed them in their Office. <hi>I will make you Fiſhers of Men.</hi> Faithfulneſs and Care, Diligence and Endeavour is our part, but the Bleſſing and Succeſs is Chriſt's; our Labour is only in the Caſt, Chriſt's Power is wholly in the Draught. Some Fiſh cleave to the Rocks, others play upon the Sands, more wallow in the Mud; and verily we ſhall labour all our Days, and catch nothing, if Chriſt doth not bring our Fiſh to Net, and incloſe them in it, as well as aſſiſt us in the throwing and caſting of it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. The Apoſtles ready Compliance with our Saviour's Call. <hi>Straightway they forſook Father and Friends, Ship and Nets,</hi> and <hi>followed Jeſus.</hi> Whom Chriſt calls, he calls effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; he draws whom he calls, and works their Hearts to a ready Compliance with their Duty. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 7. That upon their Call to the Miniſtry, they leave off their Trade, they forſake their Ship and their Nets, and lye cloſe to their Miniſterial Imployment. <hi>Teaching</hi> us, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould wholly give themſelves up to their great Work, and not incumber themſelves with ſecular Affairs, and worldly Buſineſs. Nothing but an indiſpenſible Neceſſity, in providing for a Family, can excuſe a Miniſter's encumbring himſelf with Worldly Concerns and Buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And they went into Capernaum, and ſtraightway on the ſabbath-day he entred into the ſynagogue, and taught. 22 And they were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the ſcribes.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having called his Diſciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to follow him in order to their preaching of the Goſpel; here we may obſerve how he went himſelf along with them; teaching perſonally in the Synagogues where-ever he came: He did not ſend his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles forth as his Curates, and lye at home himſelf upon his Couch of Eaſe. What ſhall we ſay to thoſe lazy Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſet others to the Drag, but care only to feed themſelves with the Fiſh? Not willing to wet their Hand with the Net, or take any Pains themſelves. Our Saviour did not thus, but when he ſent forth his Apoſtles, he ſtill preached himſelf, he went into their Synagogues, and taught. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, The Succeſs of his preaching; the People were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine, ſtruck with Admiration, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and believing him to be an extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſent from God. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That ſuch is the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Chriſt's Doctrine, eſpecially when accompanied with the Energy and Operation of his Holy Spirit, that it makes all his Auditors Admirers; cauſing Aſtoniſhment in their Minds, and Reformation in their Manners. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, The Reaſon of our Lord's Succeſs in preaching; <hi>He taught as one having Authority.</hi> He taught in his own Name, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord of his Doctrine; not ſaying with the Prophets, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> but <hi>I ſay unto you.</hi> And he wrought powerful Miracles, which accompanied his Doctrine. As Chriſt was careful to preſerve the Authority of his Perſon and Doctrine with the People, ſo is it the Duty of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to demean themſelves amongſt their People, that neither their Authority may be contemned, nor their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deſpiſed, but their Doctrine and themſelves reverenced and obeyed.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And there was in their ſynagogue a man with an unclean ſpirit, and he cried out, 24 Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Jeſus of Nazareth? Art thou come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy One of God. 25 And Jeſus rebuked him, ſaying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 26 And when the unclean ſpirit had torn him, and cried with aloud voice, he came out of him. 27 And they were all amazed, inſomuch, that they queſtioned among themſelves, ſaying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean ſpirits, and they do obey him.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Mark</hi> having given an Account of our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he preach'd, <hi>v.</hi> 15. namely, the Doctrine of Faith and Repentance, he now acquaints us in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this Chapter, with the Miracles which he wrought for the confirming of his Doctrine, and they are Three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>caſting of a Devil out of one poſſeſſed,</hi> v. 23. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>curing of</hi> Peter<hi>'s Wife's Mother of a Fever,</hi> v. 29. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>cleanſing of a Leper,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 40. to the end of the Chapter. His firſt Miracle was the <hi>caſting out of a Devil out of one poſſeſſed. There was a Man with an unclean Spirit:</hi> That is, an unclean Spirit did enter into him, and bodily poſſeſs him. Amongſt the many Calamities which Sin has brought upon our Bodies, this is one, that we are liable to be bodily poſſeſs'd by Satan. The Devil has an inveterate Malice againſt Mankind, ſeeking to ruin our Souls by his Suggeſtions and Temptations; and to deſtroy our Bodies by ſome Means or other; but bleſſed be God, tho' his Malice be infinite, yet his Power is limited and bounded; as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all the Miſchief he would, ſo he ſhall not do all he can. Oh how much is it our Intereſt, as well as our Duty, by Prayer, to put our ſelves Morning and Evening under the Divine Protection, that we may be preſerved from the Power and Malice of evil Spirits! <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Attribute or Title given to the Devil; he is called an <hi>unclean Spirit.</hi> The Devils, thoſe wicked Spirits of Hell, are moſt impure and filthy Creatures; impure by Means of their original Apoſtacy; impure by Means of their actual and daily Sins, ſuch are Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Malice, Lying, and the like, by which they continually pollute themſelves; impure, by Means of their continual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Endeavour to pollute Mankind with the Contagion of their own Sin. Lord, how foul is the Nature of Sin, which makes the Devil ſuch a foul and unclean Creature! <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. This unclean Spirit no ſooner ſaw Chriſt, but <hi>he cried out.</hi> Whence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Greatneſs of Chriſt's Power (being the Son of God) over Devils and wicked Spirits is ſuch, that it is very terrible and tormenting to them; it was terrible to them in his State of Humiliation on Earth, and made them then cry out; but Oh how terrible will his Power be to them at the great Day, when <hi>Chriſt ſhall come in flaming Fire, to render Vengeance both to Men and Devils! Obſ.</hi> 4. The Subſtance of the Devil's Outcry: <hi>Let us alone, what have we to do with thee? Art thou come to deſtroy us?</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That tho' the Devils are now as full of Sin
<pb facs="tcp:46556:50"/> and Diſcontent as they can be, yet they are not ſo full of Miſery and Torment as they ſhall be. <hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before the time?</hi> Says St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Art thou come to deſtroy us?</hi> Says St. <hi>Mark:</hi> That is, to bring upon us our full and final Deſtruction. Implying, that the Devil has not yet his full Judgment and compleat Damnation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is certainly a Day of Judgment to come, and the Devils are in Chains of Darkneſs, reſerved to the Judgment of that great Day. But ſome by theſe Words, <hi>Art thou come to deſtroy us?</hi> underſtand as much, as are thou come to reſtrain us from the Exerciſe of our Power? <hi>Learn</hi> we thence, That the Devil thinks himſelf deſtroyed when he is reſtrained from doing Miſchief. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Title which the Devil puts upon our Saviour: <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, the Holy One of God.</hi> Altho' there was Ground for the common People's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> becauſe he was bred and brought up there, and lived there during his private Life, till about 30 Years of Age; Tho' he was not born there, but at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> yet it is conceived, that the Devil gave this Title to our Saviour in Policy, to diſguiſe the place of Chriſt's Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> might not believe him to be the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> becauſe he was of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whereas the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come out of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Therefore to the Intent that the <hi>Jews</hi> might be at the greater Loſs concerning Chriſt, and in Doubt of his being the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Devil here calls him, not Jeſus of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> But how comes the next Title out of the Devil's Mouth, <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of God?</hi> Could an Apoſtle? Could <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf make a Profeſſion beyond this? But how comes the Devil to make it? For no good End or Purpoſe we may be ſure: For he never ſpeaks Truth for Truths ſake, but for Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Probably, 1. He made this Profeſſion, that ſo he might bring the Truth profeſs'd into Suſpicion, hoping that a Truth which received Teſtimony from the Father of Lies would be ſuſpected. 2. It might perhaps be done, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might believe that our Saviour had ſome Familiarity with Satan, and did work Miracles by his Help, becauſe he did confeſs him, and ſeem ſo much to honour him. From this Inſtance and Example <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is poſſible for a Perſon to own and acknowledge Chriſt to be the true and only Saviour, and yet to miſs of Salvation by him. If a ſpeculative Knowledge and a verbal Profeſſion of Chriſt were ſufficient to Salvation, the Devil himſelf would not miſs of Happineſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. How our Saviour rebukes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for this Confeſſion, and commands him Silence: <hi>And Jeſus rebuked him, ſaying, Hold thy Peace.</hi> But why was this Rebuke given the Devil, when he ſpake the Truth? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe Chriſt knew that the Devil confeſs'd this Truth on purpoſe to diſgrace the Truth. 2. Becauſe the Devil was no fit Perſon to make this Profeſſion. A Teſtimony of Truth from the Father of Lies is enough to render Truth it ſelf ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. Yet the Devil's Evidence, that Chriſt was the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of God, will riſe up in Judgment againſt the wicked Phariſees, who ſhut their Eyes againſt the Miracles, and ſtopt their Ears againſt the Doctrine <hi>of the Holy One of God. Obſ.</hi> laſtly, How the unclean Spirit obeys the Voice of Chriſt, tho' with great Reluctancy and Regret, <hi>When the unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had torn him, and cried with a loud Voice, he came out.</hi> Chriſt is Lord over the wicked Angels, and has an abſolute Power and Authority to over-rule them, and command them at his Pleaſure: If Chriſt ſays to the evil Spirit, <hi>Come out,</hi> out he muſt come. Yet obſerve the Devil's Spight at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>he tears the Man,</hi> tortures his Body, throws him violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Place to Place, ſhewing how loth he was to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed. Where Satan has once gotten an hold, and ſetled himſelf for a time, how unwilling is he to be caſt out of Poſſeſſion; yea, it is a Torture and Vexation to him to be caſt out; it is much eaſier to keep him our, than to caſt him out. Satan may poſſeſs the Body by God's Permiſſion, but he cannot poſſeſs our Hearts, without our own Conſent and Approbation; it will be our Wiſdom to deny him En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into our Souls at firſt, by rejecting his wicked Motions and Suggeſtions; for when once entered, he will, <hi>like the ſtrong Man armed, keep the Houſe, till a ſtronger than he caſts him out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28 And immediately his fame ſpread abroad throughout all the region round about Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee. 29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the ſynagogue, they entered into the houſe of Simon, and Andrew, with James and John. 30 But Simons wives mother lay ſick of a fever: and anon they tell him of her. 31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lift her up, and immediately the fever left her, and ſhe miniſtred unto them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Miracle which our Saviour wrought in this Chapter to confirm the Truth and Authority of his Doctrine was his raiſing up of <hi>Peter's Wives Mother</hi> from her Bed of Sickneſs. Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That St. <hi>Peter,</hi> now a Diſciple, and afterwards an Apoſtle, was a married Perſon. Neither the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, nor the Miniſters of the New, did abhor the Marriage Bed, nor think themſelves too pure for an Inſtitution of their Maker. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by denying the Lawfulneſs of Prieſts Marriage, makes her ſelf wiſer than God, who ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Marriage is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amongſt all Men. Obſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' a good Man, and his Wives Mother probably a gracious Woman, yet is his Family viſited with Sickneſs. Strength of Grace, and Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſpect, even from Chriſt himſelf, cannot prevail againſt Diſeaſes. God's own Children are viſited with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Sickneſſes as well as others. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The charitable Care of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Diſciples, forthwith to acquaint Chriſt with the Condition of this Sick Perſon: <hi>Anon they tell him of her.</hi> The Care of our fellow-Chriſtians, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when of the number of our near and dear Relations in a time of Sickneſs, is not to be deferred or delayed. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Help for their Bodies, and the Spiritual Help of our Prayers for their Souls, are both ſtraightway to be afforded them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Chriſt's Divine Power manifeſted in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cure: <hi>He no ſooner took her by the Hand, but the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left her.</hi> The Miracle was not in curing an incurable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, but in curing an ordinary Diſtemper after a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous manner: namely, 1. By a Touch of the Hand; 2. The Recovery was inſtantaneous and ſudden: <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Fever left her.</hi> 3. The viſible Effects of her Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inſtantly appeared, <hi>She aroſe and miniſtred unto</hi> Chriſt and his Diſciples. That ſhe could ariſe, argued her Cure miraculous; that ſhe did ariſe, and did adminiſter to Chriſt, argued her Thankfulneſs. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That after Chriſt has graciouſly healed any of us, it ought to be our firſt Work and Care to adminiſter unto Chriſt. That is, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our recovered Health in the Service of Chriſt, and to improve our renewed Strength to the Honour and Glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="32">32 And at even, when the ſun did ſet, they brought unto him all that were diſeaſed, and them that were poſſeſſed with devils: 33 And all the city was gathered together at the door. 34 And he healed many that were ſick of divers diſeaſes, and caſt out many devils, and ſuffered not the devils to ſpeak, becauſe they knew him.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt here declares ſundry other Miracles wrought by our Saviour before the Door of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Houſe, where he now was: He healed all the Diſeaſed that were brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and caſt out Devils out of them that were poſſeſſed with them. But how comes it to paſs that we read of ſo many poſſeſſed with Devils in our Saviour's time, and ſo few either before or ſince? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Probably Satan perceiving that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was come in the Fleſh to deſtroy his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, did rage the more, and diſcover greater Malice and Enmity againſt Mankind. 2. Perhaps Almighty God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Satan at that time to poſſeſs ſo many, that Chriſt might have Occaſion to manifeſt his Divine Power, by caſting Satan out: And accordingly we find our Saviour diſpoſſeſſing all that were poſſeſs'd by Satan. It is added, <hi>That he ſuffered not the Devils to ſpeak, becauſe they knew him.</hi> That is, Chriſt would not be made known to be the Son of God by the preaching of the Devil, to whom it belonged not to publiſh the Goſpel, leſt the World ſhould take from thence an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to think that our Saviour held a Correſpondency with thoſe wicked Spirits, and that the Miracles he wrought were performed by the Devil's Aſſiſtance, as being one in Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with him; poſſibly from the Devil's owning Chriſt to be the Holy One of God, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> concluded, that there
<pb facs="tcp:46556:51"/> was a Compact and Agreement betwixt them, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Affirmation was grounded, <hi>he caſteth out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. The Duty performed by our Saviour; <hi>namely,</hi> Prayer, ſolitary and private Prayer. He went by himſelf alone out of the hearing of his Diſciples. The Company of our beſt Friends is not always ſeaſonable, nor acceptable; there are Times and Caſes when a Chriſtian would not be willing that his deareſt Relations upon Earth ſhould hear that Intercourſe which paſſes betwixt him and his. God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Chriſt chuſes the Opportunity of the Morning for Prayer, <hi>He riſes a great while before Day,</hi> to ſet about this Work. <hi>Teaching</hi> us, that the Morning is a fit Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yea, the beſt Seaſon for private Duties. Now our Spirits are freſheſt, and our Minds freeſt, before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of the Day break in upon us; it is better to go from Prayer to Buſineſs, than from Buſineſs to Prayer.</p>
               <p n="36">36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 37 And when they had found him, they ſaid unto him, All men ſeek for thee. 38 And he ſaid unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there alſo: for therefore came I forth. 39 And he preached in their ſynagogues throughout all Galilee, and caſt out devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here Two Things, <hi>First,</hi> The great End of Chriſt in his Incarnation, and coming into the World, <hi>namely,</hi> as a Prophet ſent from God to reveal his Will, and to publiſh the Doctrine of the Goſpel. <hi>Therefore came I forth;</hi> that is, to preach and plant the Goſpel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It being Chriſt's Deſign, not only to plant, but propagate the Goſpel, he would not confine his Miniſtry to any particular Place, no, not to the great City of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> but reſolves to preach the Word in the ſmalleſt Towns and Villages. Leaving his Miniſters herein an inſtructive Example to be as willing to preach the Goſpel in the ſmalleſt Villages, as in the largeſt Cities, if God calls them thereunto. Let the Place be never ſo obſcure and mean, and the Congregation never ſo ſmall and little, if God ſends us thither, the greateſt of us muſt not think it beneath us, to go and inſtruct an handful of People.</p>
               <p n="40">40 And there came a leper to him, beſeeching him, and kneeling down to him, and ſaying unto him, If thou wilt thou canſt make me clean. 41 And Jeſus moved with compaſſion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and ſaith unto him, I will, be thou clean. 42 And as ſoon as he had ſpoken, immediately the leproſie departed from him, and he was cleanſed. 43 And he ſtraightly charged him, and forthwith ſent him away. 44 And ſaith unto him, See thou ſay nothing to any man: but go thy way, ſhew thy ſelf to the Prieſt, and offer for thy cleanſing thoſe things which Moſes commanded for a teſtimony unto them. 45 But he went out, and began to publiſh it much, and to blaze abroad the matter: inſomuch, that Jeſus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>
               <p>The laſt Miracle of our Saviour's, recorded in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is his healing of a leper; he came, beſeeching Chriſt to heal him: <hi>Saying, If thou wilt thou canſt make me clean.</hi> Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. He doth not queſtion Chriſt's Power, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts Chriſt's Willingneſs to heal him: <hi>Lord, if thou wilt thou canst.</hi> Chriſt's Divine Power muſt be fully aſſented to, and firmly believed by all thoſe that expect Benefit by him, and healing from him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The great Readineſs of Chriſt to help and heal this diſtreſſed Perſon. <hi>Jeſus touched him, ſaying, I will, be thou clean.</hi> By the Ceremonial Law the Leper was forbidden to be touch'd, therefore Chriſt's touching this Leper ſhewed him to be above the Law, and that he was the Lord of it, and might diſpence with it; and his healing the Leper by the Word of his Mouth, and Touch of his Hand, ſhew'd him to be truly and really God. Leproſie amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was an incurable Diſtemper, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Finger of God,</hi> a Diſeaſe of his ſending, and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving. Our Saviour therefore, as a Proof of his being the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> tells <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5. <hi>That the Lepers were cleanſed, and the Dead raiſed by him;</hi> which two being joined together, do imply, that the cleanſing of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers is as much an Act of Divine Power, as the raiſing of the Dead. And accordingly, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5.8. 'tis ſaid, <hi>Am I a God, that this Man ſends to me to cure a Man of his Leproſie. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Certainty and Suddenneſs of the Cure was a Proof of Chriſt's Divine Power: <hi>immediately</hi> his Leproſie was cleanſed. Chriſt not only cured him without Means, but without the ordinary Time required for ſuch a Cure. Thus Chriſt ſhew'd both Power and Will to cure him miraculouſly, who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Power, but queſtioned his Willingneſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Cauſe moving our Saviour to cure this Leper, <hi>his Bowels were moved with tender Pity and Compaſſion towards him.</hi> Chriſt's exerciſing Acts of Mercy and Compaſſion, with ſuch Condolency and Sympathizing Pity, ſhould by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample teach us to be inwardly moved with tender Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mercy towards ſuch as are in Miſery. We are not only to draw out our Bread, but to <hi>draw out our Soul</hi> to the Hungry. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. A twofold Charge and Command given by Chriſt to the Leper after his Cure, 1. To conceal, and <hi>Tell it to no Man.</hi> Where the great Modeſty, Humility and Piety of Chriſt is diſcovered, together with the Care of his own Safety. His Modeſty, in not deſiring his good Deeds ſhould be publiſhed and proclaimed. His Humility, in ſhunning vain-glorious Applauſe and Commendation. His Piety, in deſiring all Honour and Glory ſhould redound entirely to God. And the Care of his own Safety appeared, leſt the publiſhing of his Miracles ſhould create him untimely Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> The ſecond part of the Charge given to the recovered Leper, was, <hi>To ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt, and offer the Gift which</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded: for a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto them:</hi> That is, to teſtifie to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he did not oppoſe the Ceremonial Law, which required a Thank-Offering at his Hand, and that he was the true and promiſed <hi>Meſſiah. Learn</hi> thence, That our Saviour would have the Ceremonial Law punctually obſerv'd, ſo long as the time for its Continuance did endure; tho' he came to deſtroy that Law, yet whilſt it ſtood, he would have it punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 6. Notwithſtanding our Saviour's ſtrict Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, the Leper publiſhes the Fame of this Miracle. 'Tis like his Intention might be good, in extolling his great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, but his acting contrary to Chriſt's Command, was a Fault, and ſhews the Corruption of Humane Nature, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt forward to that which is moſt forbidden. 'Tis a Sin to do any thing againſt the Command of Chriſt, tho' with never ſo good a Meaning, Purpoſe and Intention, to Exalt and Honour Chriſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, The Inconveniences which attended our Saviour upon this indiſcreet Publication of the Miracle; and they were Two. 1. Our Saviour <hi>could no more enter into Capernaum,</hi> and other Cities, to preach in an open Manner as he had done, by reaſon of the great Concourſe of People after him. 2. The Fame of this Miracle brought the People about him <hi>from all Quarters;</hi> not ſo much to hear, as to ſee; not ſo much to hear his Holy and Heavenly Doctrine which he taught, as to gratifie their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity with the Sight of the Miracles which he wrought. Oh how many throng'd after Chriſt, more to have their Bodily Diſeaſes cured, than their Souls healed. Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not their flocking after him upon this Account; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he retires from the Breath of popular Applauſe; he would not openly enter into the City, <hi>but was without in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Places.</hi> Oh great Humility! How little did our Bleſſed Redeemer regard the Applauſe and Commendation of Men? Conſtantly we find him as ſoon as his publick Preaching and working Miracles was over, he withdraws himſelf from the Multitude into ſome private Place apart; he doth not ſtay in the Crowd with his Ear open to liſten how Men admire the Preacher, and applaud the Sermon; plainly ſhewing that he ſought his Father's Glory, not his own Praiſe, or the People's Commendation; leaving his Example as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb facs="tcp:46556:51"/> Pattern to all his Miniſters and Ambaſſadors to take heed of Vain-Glory. Not to affect Popularity, or ſeek the Applauſe and Commendation of Men in what they do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving that Man's Opinion ſhall be nothing with them, but that the pleaſing of God, and doing their Duty to the Souls of their People, ſhall always be their whole Scope.</p>

               <p n="1">1 ANd again he entered into Capernaum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome days, and it was noiſed that he was in the houſe: 2 And ſtraightway many were gathered together, inſomuch that there was no room to receive them, no not ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the door: and he preached the word unto them.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Verſe of the foregoing Chapter we find how induſtriouſly our Bleſſed Saviour withdrew himſelf from the Concourſe and Throng of People which flock'd after him from every Quarter; and to ſhew how little he affected the Applauſe and Commendation of the Multitude, he left the Cities, and <hi>was without in deſart Places.</hi> Hereby giving his Miniſters an inſtructive Example to decline Vain-Glory, and to ſhun popular Applauſe. But now the Words before us ſhew, that our Saviour having <hi>entered</hi> (privately it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>into the City of</hi> Capernaum, it is preſently noiſed, and reported, <hi>that he was in the Houſe,</hi> and a mighty Concourſe and Throng of People are after him, inſomuch, that neither the Houſe, nor hardly the Streets, could contain them. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch as leaſt ſeek after Honour and Applauſe from Men, are oft-times moſt Famous and Renowned. Our Saviour was ſo far from ſeeking the Peoples Praiſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that he came into <hi>Capernaum</hi> without Obſervation, and betook himſelf to his dwelling Houſe there; but the more he ſought to lye hid, the more he was taken notice of. Honour flies from them that purſue it, and purſues thoſe that fly from it. The way to be Honourable is to be Humble. God ſeldom honours a proud Man, by making him either eminently ſerviceable, or ſucceſsful. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, the People being come together, our Saviour takes the Opportunity to preach; <hi>And he preached the Word unto them.</hi> Teaching his Miniſters by his Example to embrace all Opportunities, in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon, on the Lord's Day, and on the Week Day, to edify our People by our Miniſtry, by our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exhortations, by our private Inſtructions, and prudent Admonitions, and holy Example.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And they came unto him, bringing one ſick of the palſie, which was born of four. 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the preſs, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the ſick of the palſie lay. 5 When Jeſus ſaw their faith, he ſaid unto the ſick of the palſie, Son, thy ſins be forgiven thee. 6 But there were certain of the ſcribes ſitting there, and reaſoning in their hearts, 7 Why doth this man thus ſpeak blaſphemies? who can forgive ſins but God only? 8 And immediately, when Jeſus perceived in his ſpirit that they ſo reaſoned within themſelves, he ſaid unto them, Why reaſon ye theſe things in your hearts? 9 Whether is it eaſier to ſay to the ſick of the palſie, Thy ſins be forgiven thee: or to ſay, Ariſe and take up thy bed and walk? 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins, (he ſaith to the ſick of the palſie) 11 I ſay unto thee, Ariſe, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine houſe. 12 And immediately he aroſe, took up the bed, and went forth before them all, inſomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, ſaying, We never ſaw it on this faſhion.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Relation of our Saviour's miraculous healing of one ſick of the Palſie at <hi>Capernaum.</hi> Where, <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. The diſeaſed and diſtreſſed Perſon, <hi>one ſick of the Palſie.</hi> Which Diſeaſe being a Reſolution and Weakneſs of the Nerves, enfeebles the Joints, and confines the Perſon to his Bed or Couch. As a Demonſtration of Chriſt's Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he was pleaſed to ſingle our the Palſie and Leproſie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Diſeaſes, to work a Cure upon ſuch as were afflicted with them. Now this Perſon was ſo great a Cripple, by reaſon of the Palſie, that he was born of Four. He could not go, nor was capable of being led, but was carried by Four in his Bed or Couch. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. As the Grievouſneſs of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſo the Greatneſs of their Faith. The Man and his Friends had a firm Perſuaſion that Chriſt was cloath'd with a Divine Power, and able to help him, and they hoped in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he was alſo willing to help him. Accordingly the Roof of the Jewiſh Houſes being flat, they uncover ſome part of it, and let the Bed down with the ſick Man in it, into the Room where Chriſt was. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. No ſooner did they exerciſe their Faith in believing, but Chriſt exerts his Divine Power in healing. And ſee the marvellous Efficacy of Faith, it obtained not only what was deſired, but more than was expected. They deſired only the healing of the Body, but Chriſt heals Body and Soul too. <hi>Son, be of good Cheer, thy Sins are forgiven.</hi> Thereby our Saviour ſhews them, that Sin is the Original Cauſe of all Bodily Diſeaſes, and conſequently that in Sickneſs the beſt way to find Eaſe and Deliverance from Pain, is firſt to ſeek for Pardon. The Senſe of Pardon in ſome degree will take away the Senſe of Pain. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Exception which the Scribes took againſt our Saviour for pronouncing, that this Man's Sins were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him. They accuſe him of the Sin of Blaſphemy; urging, that it is God's peculiar Prerogative to pardon Sin. Their Doctrine was true, but their Application falſe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more true than that it is the higheſt degree of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for any meer Man to arrogate to himſelf the incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Prerogative of God, which conſiſts in an Abſolute and Authoritative Power to forgive Sin. But then their denying this Power to Chriſt of forgiving Sin, which he had as God from all Eternity, and as Mediator, God and Man, in one Perſon, when here upon Earth; this was Blaſphemy in them, the challenging of it; none in him. <hi>Obſ.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, 1. The unwearied Pains and Diligence which our Saviour uſed in the Execution of his Miniſterial Office and Calling: No ſooner had he done preaching in <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> and healing the ſick of the Palſie, but he goeth out thence <hi>to the Sea ſide,</hi> to preach there. Oh Bleſſed Saviour! How perpetually wert thou employed in the Labours of thy Calling, in the Service of thy Father, and for the Good of Mankind! Thou went'ſt about doing Good, ſetting a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for all thy Miniſters to follow. How doth the Example of thy laborious Diligence at once inſtruct and ſhame us! <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The number of out Lord's Diſciples not being fill'd up, obſerve what a free and gracious, unexpected and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Choice he makes, <hi>Levi,</hi> that is, <hi>Matthew,</hi> (for he had both Names) a grinding Publican, who gathered the Taxes for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was probably guilty (as others were) of the Sins of Covetouſneſs, Extortion and Oppreſſion, yet is he called to follow Chriſt as a ſpecial Diſciple. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That ſuch is the Freeneſs of God's Grace, that it calls and converts Sinners unto Chriſt when they think not of him, nor ſeek unto him. Little did <hi>Levi</hi> now think of a Saviour, much leſs ſeek after him, yet is he at this time called by him. <hi>Matthew</hi> a Publican, <hi>Zacheus</hi> an Extortioner, <hi>Saul</hi> a Perſecutor, all theſe are brought home to God as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Evidences of the mighty Power of converting Grace. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s ready Compliance with Chriſt's Call; <hi>He aroſe and followed him.</hi> When the inward Call of the Holy Spirit accompanieth the outward Call of the Word, the Soul readily complies, and preſently yields Obedience to the Voice of Chriſt. Chriſt oft-times ſpeaks by his Word to our Ears, and we hear not, we ſtir not; but when he ſpeaks by his Spirit efficaciouſly to our Hearts, Satan ſhall not hold us down, the World ſhall not keep us back, but we ſhall with <hi>Levi</hi> inſtantly ariſe, and follow our Saviour. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Levi</hi> or <hi>Matthew,</hi> to ſhew his Thankfulneſs to Chriſt, makes him a great Feaſt. Chriſt invited <hi>Matthew</hi> to a Diſcipleſhip, <hi>Matthew</hi> invites Chriſt to a Dinner. The Servant invites his Maſter, a Sinner invites his Saviour. We do not find that when Chriſt was invited to any Table, that he ever refus'd to go; if a <hi>Publican,</hi> if a <hi>Phariſee</hi> invited him, he conſtantly went; not ſo much for the Pleaſure of eating, as for the Opportunity of converſing and doing Good. Chriſt feaſts us, when we feaſt him. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are full of Affection towards Chriſt, and very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of their Love unto him. <hi>Matthew</hi> touch'd with a Senſe of Chriſt's rich Love, makes him a Royal Feaſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Cavil and Exception which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> made at our Lord's free Converſation. They cenſure him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Sinners; he juſtifies himſelf, telling them that he convers'd with them as their Phyſician, not as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. <hi>They that are whole need no Phyſician,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>but they that are Sick.</hi> As if our Lord had ſaid, With whom ſhould a Phyſician converſe, but with his ſick Patients? Now I am come into the World to do the Office of a kind Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian unto Men. Surely then I am to take all Opportunities of converſing with them, that I may help and heal them, <hi>for they that are ſick need the Phyſician:</hi> But as for you <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who are well and whole in your own Opinion and Conceit, I have no Hopes of doing Good upon you; for ſuch as think themſelves whole, deſire no Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Help. From this Aſſertion of our Saviour, theſe Truths are ſuggeſted to us: 1. That Sin is the Soul's Malady, its Spiritual Diſeaſe and Sickneſs. 2. That Chriſt is the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an appointed by God for the cure and healing of this Diſeaſe. 3. That there are Multitudes of Sinners Spiritually ſick, who yet think themſelves ſound and whole. 4. That ſuch, and only ſuch as find and feel themſelves Spiritually ſick, are Subjects capable of Chriſt's healing. <hi>They that are whole need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick. I came not to call the</hi> (Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionatively) <hi>Righteous, but the</hi> (Senſible) <hi>Sinner to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. A great Difference betwixt <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples and Chriſt's in the Matter of Faſting. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, who was a Man of an Auſtere Life, and much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to faſting. Therefore is ſaid, <hi>To come neither eating nor drinking, Matth.</hi> 11.18. On the other ſide, Chriſt's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples followed him, <hi>who came eating and drinking,</hi> as other Men did; and yet tho' there was a great Difference betwixt <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples and Chriſt's in Matters of Practice, yet were they all of one Faith and Religion. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That there may be Unity of Faith and Religion among thoſe who do not maintain an Uniformity in Practice. Men may differ in ſome outward Religious Obſervations and Cuſtoms, and yet agree in the Fundamentals of Faith and Religion. Thus did <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples and Chriſt's; the one <hi>faſted often,</hi> the other <hi>faſted not. Obſ.</hi> 2. In that the Diſciples of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed to faſt as well as <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples. We may <hi>Learn,</hi> That Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and wicked Men may be, and ſometimes are as ſtrict and forward in the Outward Duties of Religion, as the holieſt and beſt of Chriſtians: They pray, they faſt, they hear the Word, they receive the Sacraments: They do, yea, it may be, they out do, and go beyond the Sincere Chriſtian in External Duties, and outward Performances. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The defenſative Plea which our Bleſſed Saviour makes for the not faſting of his Diſciples; he declares that it was neither ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, nor tolerable for them, thus to faſt at preſent. <hi>Not ſuitable,</hi> in regard of Chriſt's bodily Preſence with them. This made it a time of Joy and Rejoicing, not of Mourning and Faſting. Chriſt is the Bridegroom, and his Church the Bride; whilſt therefore his Spouſe did enjoy his bodily Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with her, it was a Day of Joy and Rejoicing to her, and Mourning and Faſting were improper for her. But when Chriſt's bodily Preſence ſhall be removed, there will be Cauſe enough to faſt and mourn. Again, This Diſcipline of Faſting was not at preſent <hi>tolerable</hi> for the Diſciples; for they were raw, green, and tender, not fit for Auſterities, nor could bear as yet the Severities of Religion, no more than an <hi>old Garment</hi> could bear a piece of <hi>new</hi> ſtiff <hi>Cloth</hi> to be ſet into it, which will <hi>make the Rent worſe,</hi> if the Garment comes to a Stretch: Or no more than <hi>old Bottles</hi> can keep <hi>new Wine.</hi> As if our Saviour had ſaid, My Diſciples at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are tender and weak, newly called and converted; they cannot therefore bear the Severities of Religion preſently; but e're long I ſhall leave them, and go to Heaven, from whence I will ſend down my Holy Spirit upon them, which ſhall enable them to all the Duties which the Goſpel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins. Now the intended Leſſon of Inſtruction from hence is this: That it is hurtful and dangerous for young Converts, for weak Chriſtians, to be put upon the ſeverer Exerciſes of Religion, or to be urged to the Performance of ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are above their Strength. But they ought to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with that Tenderneſs which becomes the mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Diſpenſation of the Goſpel. Our Saviour here commends Prudence to his Miniſters, in treating their People according to their Strength, and putting them upon Duties according to their Time and Standing.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And it came to paſs, that he went through the corn fields on the ſabbath-day, and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples began as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 24 And the Phariſees ſaid unto him, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, why do they on the ſabbath day that which is not lawful? 25 And he ſaid unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him? 26 How he went into the houſe of God in the days of Abiathar the high prieſt, and did eat the ſhew-bread, which is not
<pb facs="tcp:46556:52"/> lawful to eat, but for the prieſt, and gave alſo to them which were with him? 27 And he ſaid unto them, The ſabbath was made for man, and not man for the ſabbath: 28 Therefore the ſon of man is Lord alſo of the ſabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, 1. The Poverty, the low Eſtate and Condition of Chriſt's own Diſciples in this World; they wanted Bread, and are forced to <hi>pluck the Ears of Corn,</hi> to ſatisfie their Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. God may, and ſometimes doth ſuffer his deareſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to fall into Streights, to taſte of Want, for the Trial of their Faith and Dependance upon his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How the Phariſees (who accompanied our Saviour only with a Deſign to cavil at, and quarrel with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that either he or his Diſciples did) blame this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Diſciples, namely, their plucking of the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath-day. Yet <hi>Note,</hi> Firſt, It was not any Theft, which the Diſciples were charged with; for to take in our Neceſſity ſo much of our Neighbour's Goods as we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that if he were preſent, and knew our Circumſtances, he would give us, is no Theft. But it is the ſervile Labour on the Sabbath, in gathering the Ears of Corn which the Phariſees ſcruple. Whence <hi>Obſerve</hi> how zealous Hypocrites are for the leſſer things of the Law, whilſt they neglect the greater, and ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to outward Ceremonies; placing all Holineſs in the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, neglecting Moral Duties. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, 3. How our Saviour defends the Actions of his Diſciples, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Ears of Corn in their Neceſſity, by the Practice and Example of <hi>David.</hi> Neceſſity freed him from Fault and Blame, in eating the Conſecrated Bread, which none but the Prieſts might lawfully eat. For in Caſes of Neceſſity a Ceremonial Precept muſt give place to a Moral Duty. Works of Mercy and Neceſſity for preſerving our Lives, and the better fitting us for Sabbath Services, are certainly Lawful on the Sabbath-day. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. A double Argument which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour uſes to prove, that the Sabbath's Obſervation may be diſpenſed with in a Caſe of abſolute Neceſſity. 1. Drawn from the end of the Sabbaths Inſtitution; <hi>The Sabbath was made for Man.</hi> That is, Inſtituted of God for the Good and Benefit of Mankind, both with Reſpect to their Souls, and to their Bodies. The outward obſerving and keeping of the Sabbath is ſubordinate to the Good of Man, and therefore the Good of Man is to be preferr'd before the outward keeping of the Sabbath. 2. Argument is drawn from the Authority which Chriſt the Inſtitutor of the Sabbath has over it <hi>The Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath;</hi> That is, He has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power both as God, and as Mediator, to inſtitute and appoint a Sabbath, to alter and change the Sabbath, to diſpence with the Breach of it upon a juſt and great Occaſion. And conſequently Acts of Mercy, which tend to fit us for Works of Piety, not only may, but ought to be done upon the Sabbath-day, which was the Propoſition which our Saviour undertook to prove.</p>

               <p>The former part of this Chapter reports to us a miraculous Cure wrought by Chriſt upon a Man who had a withered Hand.

Tho' the <hi>Phariſees</hi> watched our Saviour; and when their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Malice could find no Occaſion of Quarrel, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and make one; yet ſuch was our Lord's Courage and Reſolution, that he bids <hi>the Man which had the withered Hand ſtand forth:</hi> To ſhew that he was reſolved to heal him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their malicious Purpoſe to accuſe him for it, as a Breaker of the Sabbath.

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, 1. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſinful and graceleſs Diſpoſition, and that was Hardneſs of Heart. The Heart of Man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hard, and full of Obſtinacy and Enmity againſt Chriſt; but there is an acquired Hardneſs, which Continuance in Sin occaſions; the <hi>Phariſees</hi> laboured under both. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. A dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Affection, which this Hardneſs of Heart, found in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> did ſtir up in Chriſt, namely, Anger and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Grief and Commiſeration: <hi>He was grieved for the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts. Learn</hi> hence, 1. That Humane Paſſions are not ſinful, and that Chriſtian Religion doth not deſtroy natural Affections. 2. That Anger at Sin, either in our ſelves or others, if kept within its due Bounds, is not only lawful, but commendable. 3. That our Anger againſt Sin ought to be accompanied with Grief and Compaſſion towards Sinners. We ſhould pour out our Tears of Compaſſion, when Men pour forth their Abominations. 4. That of all Sins Hardneſs of Heart and Unbelief are moſt grievous and offenſive, moſt diſpleaſing and provoking to Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>He looked about with Anger, being grieved for the Hardneſs of their Hearts. Obſ.</hi> 3. The ſudden and inſtantaneous Cure which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our wrought upon the Man that had the withered Hand: Our Saviour did not touch him, but only ſaid to him, <hi>Stretch forth thy Hand, and it was preſently cured. Learn</hi> hence, That Chriſt's having abſolute Power over all bodily Diſeaſes and Infirmities to cure them miraculouſly without Means, only by a Word ſpeaking, is one Argument that proves him to be truly and really God.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, 1. What a diſmal Effect this famous Miracle of Chriſt's had upon the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Herodians.</hi> Inſtead of being convinced by it, they conſpire againſt him for it. Theſe <hi>Herodians</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were of different Opinions, Enemies to one another, yet they join together in ſeeking the Death of Chriſt. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were againſt paying Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> looking upon themſelves as a free People, and accounting the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour an Uſurper. The <hi>Herodians</hi> were for it. <hi>Herod</hi> being made by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was zealous for having the <hi>Jews</hi> pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and ſuch of the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſided with him, particularly his Courtiers and Favourites were ſtiled <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> but both <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi> take Counſel againſt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:53"/> Chriſt. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Unity and Conſent is of it ſelf alone far from being a Mark and Note of the true Church. Unity in the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt, and in the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Practice of the true Religion, is a Note indeed of the true Church: But Unity in oppoſing Chriſt, his Perſon, his Doctrine, his People, is ſo far from being a Mark of the true Church, that it is the Badge of the Antichriſtian Synagogue. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The prudent Means which our Saviour uſes to preſerve himſelf from the Rage of the <hi>Phariſees, he withdrew himſelf from them.</hi> Chriſt's Example teaches his Miniſters their Duty in a time of Danger, to fly from Perſecution, and to endeavour to preſerve their Lives, unleſs when their Sufferings are like to do more Good than their Lives. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The great Zeal and Forwardneſs of the People, in flocking after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Miniſtry; People come now at firſt from all Places and Countries, from <hi>Judea,</hi> from <hi>Idumea,</hi> from beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> from <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> to hear his Doctrine, and ſee his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The People came from all parts when our Saviour firſt began to preach. His Miniſters find it thus: At their firſt coming amongſt a People their Labours are moſt acceptable, and they do moſt Good; our Peoples Affections are then warmeſt, and perhaps our own too. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. What ſort of People they were which attended thus zealouſly upon our Saviour's Miniſtry, they were the common and ordinary People; <hi>the poor received the Goſpel,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and other Men of moſt Account, the <hi>mighty,</hi> the <hi>noble,</hi> and the <hi>wiſe Men after the Fleſh,</hi> deſpiſed our Saviour's Perſon, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Miniſtry, and ſought his Life. The ordinary and meaneſt ſort of People ever have been more zealous and forward in embracing the Goſpel, than ever the Great, the Rich, and the Honourable part of the World have been. It is a ſad, but a certain Truth, Heaven is a place, where few (comparatively) of the great Men of the World are like to come; their Temptations are many, their Luſts are ſtrong, and their great Eſtates, thro' their own Abuſe become Fuel to their Luſts. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Behaviour of the unclean Spirits (the Devils) towards our Saviour, and our Saviour's Carriage towards them: <hi>They fall down at the very ſight of him, they cry out, and confeſs him to be the Son of God;</hi> but he ſharply <hi>Rebukes</hi> them, and <hi>charges them that they ſhould not make him known.</hi> Not that our Saviour would have the Knowledge of his Perſon ſuppreſt, but becauſe the Devils were no fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to preach Jeſus Chriſt. A Truth out of the Mouth of the Father of Lies is enough to render Truth it ſelf ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Beſides, the time appointed for the full and clear Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Godhead of Chriſt was not yet come. This was not to be done till after his Reſurrection, the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to lye hid under the Veil of Chriſt's Fleſh, during his ſtate of Humiliation and Abaſement.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him. 14 And he ordained twelve, that they ſhould be with him, and that he might ſend them forth to preach: 15 And to have power to heal ſickneſſes, and to caſt out devils. 16 And Simon he ſirnamed Peter. 17 And James <hi>the ſon</hi> of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, (and he ſirnamed them Boanerges, which is, The ſons of thunder) 18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James <hi>the ſon</hi> of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite, 19 And Judas Iſcariot, which alſo betrayed him: and they went into an houſe.</p>
               <p>As the Jewiſh Church aroſe from <hi>Twelve Patriarchs,</hi> ſo the Chriſtian Church became planted by <hi>Twelve Apoſtles,</hi> the Perſon commiſſioning them was Chriſt. None may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Work and Calling of the Miniſtry but thoſe whom Chriſt appoints and calls. The Perſons commiſſioned were Diſciples before they were Apoſtles; to teach us, That Chriſt will have ſuch as preach the Goſpel to be Diſciples before they are Miniſters; trained up in the Faith and Doctrine of the Goſpel before they undertake a publick Charge. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, The Holy Preparative which our Saviour uſes, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this Election of his Apoſtles, he goeth up into a Mountain to pray upon that great Occaſion. So ſays St. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. <hi>He went up into a Mountain to pray,</hi> and <hi>ſpent the night in Prayer to God.</hi> And <hi>when it was Day he called his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and of them he choſe Twelve.</hi> In this Prayer no doubt he pleaded with his Father to furniſh thoſe that were to be ſent forth by him with all Miniſterial Gifts and Graces. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That as Prayer is a neceſſary Preparative to all Duties, ſo more eſpecially before the publick Election and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſters of the Church; ſolemn Prayer is to be uſed by ſuch as are to ordain and chooſe them; our Lord's Practice is to be a ſtanding Rule herein to all Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. <hi>Obſerve</hi> again, Tho' Chriſt called his Apoſtles now, yet he did not ſend them forth now: <hi>He ordained Twelve, that they ſhould be with him.</hi> That is, that they might converſe with him, and be Eye-witneſſes, and Ear-witneſſes of his Life, Doctrine and Miracles. And having been thus with Chriſt, and fitted and prepared by him for their Work after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they went forth. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch as are to take upon them the Office of the Miniſtry, ought firſt to be fitted and prepared for it, then ſolemnly called to it, before they enterprize and undertake the Execution of it; if the Apoſtles here, who were called and qualified extraordinarily, were to ſpend ſome Time with Chriſt to receive Direction and Inſtruction from him before they went forth to preach; how much more needful is it for ſuch as are ordinarily called to be well-fitted and furniſhed for the Miniſterial Service before they undertake it. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> next, How the ſeveral Names of the Apoſtles are here Regiſtred and Recorded: God will honour thoſe that honour him, and are the ſpecial Inſtruments of his Glory. Of theſe Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> is named firſt, and <hi>Judas</hi> laſt. <hi>Peter</hi> is named firſt, becauſe probably elder than the reſt, or becauſe for Order-ſake he might ſpeak before the reſt. From whence may be inferr'd a Primacy, but no Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; a Priority of Order, not a Superiority of Degree, As the Foreman of a Grand-Jury has a Precedency, but no Preheminency; he is firſt in order before the reſt, but has no Authority or Power over the reſt. <hi>Judas</hi> is named laſt, with a Brand of Infamy upon him; that he was the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Perſon that betrayed his Lord and Maſter. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That tho' the Truth of Grace be abſolutely neceſſary to a Miniſter's Salvation, yet the want of it doth not diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul his Office, nor hinder the Lawfulneſs of his Miniſtry. <hi>Judas,</hi> tho' a Traytor, was yet a Lawful Miniſter. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, That our Saviour ſirnamed <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Sons of Thunder. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> thinks this Name was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, becauſe being with Chriſt in the Mount at his Transfiguration, they heard the Father's Voice out of the Cloud like Thunder: Others think them ſo called, becauſe they were more vehement and earneſt than the reſt in preaching, and did with greater Zeal and Power ſound forth the Doctrine of the Goſpel like Thunder.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And the multitude cometh together again, ſo that they could not ſo much as eat bread. 21 And when his friends heard <hi>of it,</hi> they went out to lay hold on him: for they ſaid, He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelf. 22 And the ſcribes which came down from Jeruſalem, ſaid, He hath Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, and by the prince of the devils caſteth he out devils. 23 And he called them unto him, and ſaid unto them in parables, How can Satan caſt out Satan? 24 And if a kingdom be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf, that kingdom cannot ſtand. 25 And if a houſe be divided againſt it ſelf, that houſe cannot ſtand. 26 And if Satan riſe up againſt himſelf, and be divided, he cannot ſtand, but hath an end. 27 No man can enter into a ſtrong man's houſe, and ſpoil his goods, except he will firſt bind the ſtrong man, and then he will ſpoil his houſe. 28 Verily I ſay unto you, All ſins ſhall be forgiven unto the ſons of men, and blaſphemies, wherewith ſoever they ſhall blaſpheme: 29 But he that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 30 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaid, He hath an unclean ſpirit.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. How truly our Lord's Word was verified. <hi>John</hi> 4.34. <hi>My Meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me;</hi> for he and his Apoſtles going into an Houſe to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Hunger, the People preſs'd upon him ſo faſt to hear the Word, that he regards not the ſatisfying of his Hunger, but applies himſelf to inſtruct the People. Lord! how exemplary was thy Zeal and Diligence in preaching the everlaſting Goſpel to a loſt World. As it is inſtructive to, may it be imitated and followed by all thy Ambaſſadors. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The raſh Cenſure of our Saviour's Friends; that is, his Kinſmen, concerning this Action, in neglecting to eat Bread, and ſuffering the Multitude thus unſeaſonably to preſs upon him. They conclude he is beſides himſelf. Out of his right Mind, and accordingly went out to lay hold upon him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the forward Zeal and Diligence of Chriſt and his Miniſters in preaching the Goſpel is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Madneſs and Frenzy by a Blind World. But they may ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>If we be beſides our ſelves it is unto God.</hi> But who were the Perſons that thus look'd upon our Saviour as beſides himſelf? Verily his own Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Relations according to the Fleſh. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That oft-times the Servants of God meet with the ſtrongeſt Temptations from, and are moſt diſcouraged and moleſted by ſuch as are their neareſt Relations by Blood or Alliance. This is a great Trial to find our Relations ſetting us back, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of helping us forward in the ways of Religion; but we muſt bear it patiently, knowing, that not only others of God's Children, but Jeſus Chriſt his own and only Son, did experience this Trial. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 3. The malicious and wicked Slander which the <hi>Scribes</hi> endeavoured to fix upon our Bleſſed Saviour; namely, That he was poſſeſt of the Devil, and by Familiarity with him, and Help from him, caſt forth Devils out of others. Good God! how was thine own and only Son, the Holy and Innocent Jeſus, cenſured, ſlandered, and falſly accuſed of the worſt of Crimes; of Gluttony, of Blaſphemy, of Sorcery: Can any of thy Children expect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Perſecution of the Tongue, when Innocency it ſelf could not protect thy Holy Son from Slander and falſe Accuſation? <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. Our Saviour's Anſwer and juſt Apology for himſelf, in which are contained, 1. A Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Calumny and Slander. 2. A Reprehenſion of the <hi>Scribes</hi> for the ſame. 1. To confute this Slander, our Saviour by ſeveral Arguments ſhews how abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it is, that the Devil ſhould caſt out himſelf, and any ways oppoſe or ſeek to deſtroy his own Kingdom. As if our Saviour had ſaid, Is it likely that Satan would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end me his Power to uſe it againſt himſelf? Surely Satan will do nothing to weaken his own Intereſt, or ſhake the Pillars of his own Kingdom. Now if I have received my Power from Satan for deſtroying him and his Kingdom. Then is Satan like a Family divided within it ſelf, and like a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, which can never ſtand, but be brought to Deſolation. Our Saviour having ſufficiently ſhewn, that he did not work his Miracles by the Power of the Devil, he next informs them from whence he had that Power, even from God himſelf; and accordingly he compares Satan to a ſtrong Man well-armed, with Weapons to defend his Houſe; and he compares himſelf (clothed with Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) to one that is ſtronger than the ſtrong Man. So that the Argument runs thus; The Devil is very ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and there is no Power but God's only that is ſtronger than his. If then (ſays Chriſt) I were not aſſiſted with a Divine Power, I could never caſt out this ſtrong Man, who reigns in the Bodies and Souls of Men, as in his Houſe; for it muſt be a ſtronger than the ſtrong Man that ſhall bind Satan, and who is he, but the God of Strength. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt's Divine Power is only Superiour to Satan's Strength. He only can vanquiſh and over-rule him at his Pleaſure, and drive him out of that Poſſeſſion which he holds either in the Bodies, or in the Souls of Men. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. The Charge which our Saviour brings againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> for Blaſpheming his Divine Power, in working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. He charges them with ſinning the unpardonable Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>All Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that ſhall Blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt hath never Forgiveneſs.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, All the Reproaches which you caſt upon me as Man are pardonable, as when you check me with the <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Meaneſs of my Birth;</hi> when you cenſure me for a <hi>Wine-bibber,</hi> a <hi>Glutton,</hi> a <hi>Friend</hi> and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and the like unjuſt Crimes: But when you Blaſpheme that Divine Power, by which all my Miracles are wrought, and contrary to the Convictions of your own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Minds maliciouſly aſcribe all my Miracles to the Power of the Devil, which were wrought indeed by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, this makes your Condition not only dangerous, but deſperate, becauſe you reſiſt the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and oppoſe the beſt Means for your Conviction. For what can be done more to convince you that I am the true and promiſed Meſſiah, than to work ſo many Miracles before your Eyes to that Purpoſe. Now if when you ſee theſe, you will ſay it is not the Spirit of God that works theſe, but the Power of the Devil; as if Satan would conſpire againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſeek the Ruin of his own Kingdom; there is no Way or Means left to convince you, but you will continue in your Obſtinacy, and malicious Oppoſition to Truth, to your unutterable and inevitable Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="31">31 There came then his brethren, and his mother, and ſtanding without, ſent unto him, calling him. 32 And the multitude ſat about him, and they ſaid unto him, Behold, thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy brethren without ſeek for thee. 33 And he anſwered them, ſaying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? 34 And he looked round about on them which ſat about him, and ſaid, Behold my mother and my brethren. 35 For whoſoever ſhall do the will of God, the ſame is my brother, and my ſiſter, and mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ. here,</hi> 1. The Truth and Verity of Chriſt's Humane Nature; he had Affinity and Conſanguinity with Men, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons near in Blood to him by the Mother's ſide, called here his <hi>Brethren,</hi> that is, his Kinſmen. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That the Mother of Chriſt, tho' ſhe was a Bleſſed and Holy Woman, yet was ſhe not free from Sin, but Failings and Infirmities are found with her. It was a Fault to interrupt our Saviour unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably at this time, when he was preaching to the People. The like we ſee in her at other times. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.48. and <hi>John</hi> 2.3. No Saint here on Earth ever was in a State of Sinleſs Perfection. Bleſſed be God we are haſtning to ſuch a State. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That Chriſt did not neglect his Holy Mother, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard his poor Kindred and Relations, but only ſhewed that he preferred his Father's Work and Buſineſs, before their Company and Acquaintance at this time. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. How exceeding dear, obedient Chriſtians are to Jeſus Chriſt; he preferrs his Spiritual Kindred before his Natural, Alliance by Faith is more valued by our Saviour, than Alliance by Blood. To bear Chriſt in the Heart is a greater Honour than to bear him in the Womb. Bleſſed be God, this great and gracious Priviledge is not denied us; even now. Altho' we cannot ſee Chriſt, yet love him we may. His Bodily Preſence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enjoyed by us, but his Spiritual Preſence is not denied us. Tho' Chriſt be not ours in Houſe, in Arms, in Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Conſanguinity, yet in Heart, in Faith, in Love, in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he is or may be ours. Verily, Spiritual Regeneration bringeth Men into a more honourable Relation to Chriſt, than Natural Generation ever did.</p>

               <p>The foregoing Chapter acquainted us with the Blaſphemous Slander which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> caſt upon our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, accuſing him for caſting out Devils by the Help of the Devil. This they did, no doubt, to diſcredit his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and hinder his Miniſtry, yet for all this the People follow him in great Multitudes, more than ever to hear him, and be inſtructed by him: <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That all the Power and Malice of Satan and wicked Men ſhall not be able to ſuppreſs the Goſpel, or hinder the free Courſe of it; yea, the more it is oppoſed, the more it ſhall prevail; the more the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> diſgraced our Saviour, and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Doctrine, the more the People followed him in Troops to be Partakers of his Miniſtry. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Place where our Lord now preached, <hi>in a Ship.</hi> Not
<pb facs="tcp:46556:54"/> that he declined the Temple, or the Synagogue, when he had Opportunity, but in the want of them; Chriſt thought an Houſe, a Mountain, a Ship, no unmeet Place to preach in. It is not the Place that ſanctifies the Ordinance, but the Ordinance that ſanctifies the Place. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Our Saviour's Geſture in preaching, <hi>he ſat,</hi> it being the Cuſtom of the Jewiſh Church ſo to do. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>Chair. Learn thence,</hi> That in indifferent Rites and Orders touching the outward Worſhip of God, we are to conform our ſelves to the Laudable Cuſtom and Practice of the Church in which we live, and whereof we are Members. Thus did our Saviour, and ſo ought we. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The manner of our Lord's Preaching, it was by <hi>Parables</hi> and Similitudes, which was an antient way of Inſtruction among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and a very convincing way, working upon Men's Minds, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Affections all at once, making the Mind attentive, the Memory retentive, and the Auditors inquiſitive after the Interpretation of the Parable. Some are of Opinion that our Saviour's Parables were ſuited to his Hearers Imployments, and accordingly many of his Hearers being Husbandmen, he reſembles his Doctrine to Seed ſown in the Field. For thus he ſpeaks:</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hearken, Behold, there went out a ſower to ſow: 4 And it came to paſs as he ſowed, ſome fell by the way ſide, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 5 And ſome fell on ſtony ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it ſprang up, becauſe it had no depth of earth. 6 But when the ſun was up, it was ſcorched, and becauſe it had no root, it withered away. 7 And ſome fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and it yielded no fruit. 8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that ſprang up and increaſed, and brought forth ſome thirty, ſome ſixty, and ſome an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. 9 And he ſaid unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p>Several things are here <hi>Obſervable.</hi> As, 1. How Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends the Parable with an Admonition to diligent and ſerious Attention. <hi>Hearken,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and <hi>he that hath Ears to hear, let him hear,</hi> v. 9. This ſhews us at once the People's Backwardneſs and Negligence, in applying their Minds to hear and receive the Word of God, and alſo ſhews the Miniſter's Duty to excite and ſtir up their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Diligence and Attention in hearing God's Word. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. What is the general Scope and Deſign of this Parable: <hi>Namely,</hi> To ſhew, that there are four ſeveral ſorts of Hearers of God's Word, and but one good one, but one ſort only hear to a ſaving Advantage. Now as to the Matter of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Note</hi> 1. <hi>The Sower</hi> is Chriſt and his Apoſtles. He the principal Sower, they the Subordinate Seedſmen. Chriſt ſows his own Field, his Miniſters ſow his Field. He ſows his own Seed, they his Seed. Wo unto us, if we ſow our own Seed, not Chriſt's. <hi>Note</hi> 2. <hi>The Seed</hi> ſown, the Word of God; fabulous Legends, and unwritten Traditions, which the Seedſmen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſow; theſe are not Seed, but Chaff, or their own Seed, and not Chriſt's. Our Lord's Field muſt be all ſown with his own Seed, with no mixt Grain. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. That the Word preach'd is like Seed ſown in the Furrows of the Field. As Seed has as a fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Virtue in it, by which it encreaſes and brings forth more of its own kind; ſo has the Word of God a quickning Power to regenerate and make alive dead Souls. 2. <hi>Learn</hi> from this Parable, That the Seed of the Word, where it is moſt plentifully ſown, is not alike fruitful. Seed doth not thrive in all Ground alike, neither doth the Word fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie alike in the Souls of Men. There is a Difference both from the Nature of the Soyl, and from the Influence of the Spirit. For tho' no Ground be naturally good, yet ſome is worſe than other. <hi>Learn</hi> 3. That the Cauſe of the Words Unfruitfulneſs is very different, not the ſame in all. In ſome 'tis an hard Heart of Unbelief, in others the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Cares of the World choak the Word. Like Thorns, which hinder the Corns growth, by overſhadowing it, by drawing away the Moiſture and Heart of the Earth from it, and by hindering the Influences of the Sun from cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Unto which may be added the Policy of Satan, that Bird of Prey, which follows God's Plough, and ſteals away the precious Seed of the Word out of the Furrows of their Souls. <hi>Learn</hi> 4. That the beſt Ground doth not bring forth Encreaſe alike. Some good Ground brings forth more, others leſs; ſome Thirty, ſome Sixty, ſome an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold. In like manner a Perſon may be a profitable Hearer of the Word, altho' he doth not bring forth ſo great a Proportion of Fruit as others, provided he brings forth as much as he can.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve, asked of him the parable. 11 And he ſaid unto them, Unto you it is given to know the myſtery of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: but unto them that are without, all theſe things are done in parables: 12 That ſeeing they may ſee, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not underſtand; leſt at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them. 13 And he ſaid unto them, Know ye not this parable? And how then will you know all parables?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Diſciples Queſtion, and our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Their Queſtion is about the Sence and Meaning of the Parable. They own their Ignorance, and deſire better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. It is no Shame for the beſt of Miniſters, yea, the beſt of Men, to acknowledge their own Ignorance in the Myſteries of Religion, and to attend upon the Means of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in order to their further Information. In our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Anſwer, <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That the Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are great Myſteries. 2. That it is a matchleſs and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Priviledge, practically to underſtand Goſpel Myſteries. 3. That this Priviledge all are not Sharers in, and Partakers of, but only thoſe to whom it is given. 4. That it is a Righteous Thing with God to give ſuch Perſons over to further Blindneſs and Ignorance in Spiritual Things, who wilfully reject the Truth, and ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light and Evidence of it. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> had all along ſhut their Eyes, and ſaid, they would nor ſee, and now Chriſt cloſes their Eyes judicially, and ſays they ſhall not ſee. <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye ſhall ſee, and not perceive; and hearing ye ſhall hear, and not underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 The ſower ſoweth the word. 15 And theſe are they by the way ſide, where the word is ſown, but when they have heard, Satan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth immediately, and taketh away the word that was ſowen in their hearts. 16 And theſe are they likewiſe which are ſown on ſtony ground, who when they have heard the word, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately receive it with gladneſs: 17 And have no root in themſelves, and ſo endure but for a time: afterward when affliction or perſecution ariſeth for the word's ſake, immediately they are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 18 And theſe are they which are ſown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thorns: ſuch as hear the word, 19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, and the luſts of other things entring in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 20 And theſe are they which are ſown on good ground, ſuch as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, ſome thirty fold, ſome ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſome an hundred.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour applies himſelf to interpret and explain the foregoing Parable. <hi>The Seed</hi> is the Word, <hi>the Sower</hi> is the Preacher, the Soyl is the Heart and Soul of Man. Some Hearers Chriſt compares to the <hi>Highway</hi> Ground, in which the Seed lyes uncovered, for want of the Harrow of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others to <hi>Stony</hi> Ground, in which the Word has <hi>no Root.</hi> No Root in their Underſtandings, in their Memories, Wills and Affections, but they are inſtantly offended, either
<pb facs="tcp:46556:54"/> at the Depth and Profoundneſs of the Word, or at the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Strictneſs of the Word, or elſe at the Plainneſs and Simplicity of it. Again, Some Hearers our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to <hi>Thorny</hi> Ground, Worldly and Covetous Deſires, are as Thorns, choaking the good Seed; they ſhadow the Blade when ſprung up, keep off the Influences of the Sun, and draw away the Fatneſs of the Soyl from the Seed. All theſe miſchievous Effects have Thorns among the Seed. And the like ill Effects have worldly Affections, and covetous Deſires in the Soul of Man; rendring the Seed of the Word unfruitful and unprofitable. But the good Chriſtian hears the Word attentively, keeps it retentively, believes it ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, applies it particularly, practices it univerſally, and brings forth Fruit perſeveringly. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. That no Hearers are in Chriſt's Account good Hearers of the Word, but ſuch as bring forth Fruit anſwerable to their hearing. 2. That a Perſon may be a good Hearer of the Word in Chriſt's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if he bring forth the beſt Fruit he can, tho' it be not in ſo great a Proportion as others do. As ſome Ground brings forth <hi>Thirty,</hi> ſome <hi>Sixty,</hi> and ſome <hi>an Hundredfold,</hi> in like manner do all ſincere Hearers of the Word; they all bring forth Fruit, tho' not all alike; all in Sincerity, tho' not all equally, and none to Perfection.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And he ſaid unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a buſhel, or under a bed? and not to be ſet on a candleſtick? 22 For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hid, which ſhall not be manifeſted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any thing kept ſecret, but that it ſhould come abroad. 23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 24 And he ſaid unto them, Take heed what you hear: with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you: and unto you that hear, ſhall more be given. 25 For he that hath, to him ſhall be given: and he that hath not, from him ſhall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The End and Deſign of Chriſt in revealing his Word and Will to his Diſciples, and in communicating to them the Light of Spiritual Knowledge; <hi>namely,</hi> That they may communicate it to others, and not keep it cloſe unto themſelves. Even as the <hi>Candle</hi> in an Houſe diffuſes and diſperſes its Light to all that come within the Reach of it. In like manner ought all Chriſtians, and particularly Chriſt's Miniſters, by the Light of Life and Doctrine, to direct Perſons in their Way towards Heaven. Such as are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God in any meaſure with the Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of his Word, ought not to conceal and hide this Knowledge within themſelves, but communicate it to others, and imploy it for the Good and Benefit of others. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Cautionary Direction given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>To take heed how they hear the Word.</hi> Such as would profit by hearing of the Word, muſt diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Matter of the Doctrine which they hear, and alſo to the manner how they hear. Such is the Majeſty and Authority of the Perſon that ſpeaks to us in the Word; ſuch is the Sublimity and Spirituality of the Matter; and ſo great is our Danger, if we miſcarry under the Word, that it nearly concerns us <hi>to take heed,</hi> both <hi>what we hear,</hi> and <hi>how we hear. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Argument which our Saviour makes uſe of to quicken his Diſciples to communicate the Knowledge, and improve the Grace they had received for the Good and Benefit of others, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> That is, Such as improve their Spiritual Gifts ſhall have them encreaſed; ſuch as improve them not, ſhall have them blaſted. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the beſt Courſe we can take to encreaſe and thrive in Grace, is to exerciſe and improve it. He that hides his Talent, doth not only forfeit it, but is in danger of being puniſhed ſeverely for the Non-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And he ſaid, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, 27 And ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how. 28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of her ſelf, firſt the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. 29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſickle, becauſe the harveſt is come.</p>
               <p>This Parable of our Saviour's is an inſtructive Leſſon to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, faithfully to do their Parts, in ſowing the Seed of the Word amongſt their People, and then not to be over-ſolicitous about the Event, but to leave the Iſſue to God, nor to be diſcouraged, tho' the Fruit of their Labour doth not preſently appear. Accordingly Chriſt propounds the laborious Husbandman to his Miniſter's Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the Husbandman, when he has prudently and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully caſt his Seed into the Ground, is not Anxiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, but goes to Bed, and reſts in hope, and at length the Corn ſprings up; firſt the <hi>Blade,</hi> next the <hi>Ear,</hi> then the <hi>Grain.</hi> In like manner, let the Miniſters of God do their Duty without Diſcouragement, <hi>In the Morning ſow their Seed, and in the Evening not withhold their Hand.</hi> And altho' the Seed ſowen doth not appear preſently, it may be, not in our Days, but ſeems rotten among the Clods, yet may it appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a plentiful Encreaſe, when our own Heads are laid among the Clods; verifying that Saying of our Saviour, <hi>One ſoweth, and another reapeth. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Miniſtry of the Word is the ordinary, the neceſſary, and the principal Means which God has appointed for ſowing the Seeds of Grace in the Hearts of his People. <hi>So is the Kingdom of God, as if a Man ſhould caſt Seed into the Ground.</hi> 2. That the Virtue and Efficacy of the Word preached doth not depend upon the Parts of a Man, but upon the Power of God. <hi>The Seed ſpringeth up he knoweth not how. Learn</hi> 3. That the Word of God ſincerely preached may be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, tho' it be not preſently ſucceſsful; the Seed ſown in one Miniſter's Days may ſpring up in another's. Happy we, if as God's Husbandmen we be imployed in Plowing, Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Reaping; our Lord will reward us. <hi>Secundum labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, non fructum.</hi> Not according to our Succeſs, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Endeavours. The Care and Endeavour is ours but the Bleſſing and Succeſs is God's.</p>
               <p n="30">30 And he ſaid, Whereunto ſhall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what compariſon ſhall we compare it? 31 It is like a grain of muſtard-ſeed, which when it is ſown in the earth, is leſs than all the ſeeds that be in the earth. 32 But when it is ſown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out great branches, ſo that the fowls of the air may lodge under the ſhadow of it. 33 And with many ſuch parables ſpake he the word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as they were able to hear it. 34 But without a parable ſpake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his diſciples.</p>
               <p>The Deſign of our Saviour in this Parable, is to ſhew how the Goſpel Church from ſmall and little, from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and contemptible Beginnings, ſhould ſpread and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, fructifie and grow up like as Muſtard-Seed; one of the ſmalleſt of Grains, grows up to a conſiderable Tallneſs: Even ſo, Chriſt foretels, that the Goſpel ſhould ſpread and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, Nations and Countries becoming Chriſtian. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That how ſmall Beginnings ſoever the Goſpel had in its firſt Plantation; yet by the fructifying Bleſſing of God it has had, and ſhall have a wonderful Encreaſe.</p>
               <p n="35">35 And the ſame day when the even was come, he ſaith unto them, Let us paſs over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other ſide. 36 And when they had ſent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ſhip, and there were alſo with him other little ſhips. 37 And there aroſe a great ſtorm of wind, and the waves beat into the ſhip, ſo that it was now full. 38 And he was in the hinder part of the ſhip, aſleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and ſay unto him, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, careſt thou not that we periſh? 39 And
<pb facs="tcp:46556:55"/> he aroſe, and rebuked the wind, and ſaid unto the ſea, Peace, be ſtill: and the wind ceaſed, and there was a great calm. 40 And he ſaid unto them, Why are ye ſo fearful? how is it that you have no faith? 41 And they feared exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſaid one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the ſea obey him?</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, 1. Our Saviour and his Diſciples no ſooner put forth to Sea, but Dangers attend, and Difficulties do accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them; a Tempeſt aroſe, and that Ship was covered with Waves which Chriſt himſelf was in, with his Diſciples. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the Preſence of Chriſt it ſelf doth not exempt his Diſciples and Followers from Trouble and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Here is a great Tempeſt about the Diſciples Ears, tho' Chriſt himſelf was in their Company. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Poſture our Saviour was in when this Tempeſt aroſe; he being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the Labours of the Day, was laid down upon a Pillow to ſleep at Night, thereby ſhewing himſelf to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really Man; and that as he took upon him our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, ſo he aſſumed the Infirmities of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo, as Wearineſs and Pain, Hunger and Thirſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Diſciples Application made to Chriſt; they awake him with a ſad outcry, <hi>Maſter, careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> Here was Faith mixt with Humane Frailty. They believed that he could ſave them, but being aſleep, they conclude he muſt be awaked before they can be ſaved by him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, tho' his Humane Nature was aſleep, yet his Divine Nature neither ſlumbered nor ſlept. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Fear in a time of great and imminent Danger, tho' it may argue Weakneſs of Faith, yet is no Evidence of a total want of Faith, in the midſt of the Diſciples Fears they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Chriſt's Power. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. A doable Rebuke given by our Saviour, firſt to the Winds, next to the Fears of his Diſciples. <hi>He rebukes the Winds,</hi> and inſtantly <hi>they are calm.</hi> When the Sea was as furious as a madman, Chriſt with a ſingle Word calms it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the moſt raging Winds and outragious Seas cannot ſtand before the Rebukes of Chriſt. Chriſt as God lays a Law upon the moſt lawleſs Creatures, even when they ſeem to act moſt lawleſly. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, Chriſt rebukes his Diſciples Fears, <hi>Why are ye fearful?</hi> No ſooner was the Storm up, but their Fears were up; they forgot that the Lord high Admiral of the Ocean, was on board the Ship, and were as much overſet with their boiſterous Paſſions, as the Veſſel was with tempeſtuous Winds; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Chriſt rebukes the Tempeſt within, before the Storm without. Firſt he calms their Hearts, then he quiets the Seas. From this Inſtance of the Diſciples we may gather, that great Faith in the Habit may appear little in Act, and exerciſe the Diſciples Faith, in forſaking all, and following Chriſt, was great Faith; but in this preſent Act, their Faith was weak, thro' the Prevalency of their Fears. Oh the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Compoſition of the beſt of Saints! Faith and Fear will take their turns, and act their part whilſt we are upon the Stage of this World; e're long our Fears will be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and our Faith ſwallowed up in Viſion. Lord! ſet our Souls a longing for that joyful Hour.</p>

               <p n="1">1 ANd they came over unto the other ſide of the ſea, into the country of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darenes. 2 And when he was come out of the ſhip, immediately there met him out of the tombs, a man with an unclean ſpirit, 3 Who had his dwelling among the tombs, and no man could bind him, no not with chains: 4 Becauſe that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked aſunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 5 And always night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himſelf with ſtones. 6 But when he ſaw Jeſus afar off, he ran and worſhipped him, 7 And cried with a loud voice, and ſaid, What have I to do with thee, Jeſus, thou Son of the moſt high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me not. 8 (For he ſaid unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean ſpirit.) 9 And he asked him, What is thy name? and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſaying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 10 And he beſought him much, that he would not ſend them away out of the country. 11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains, a great herd of ſwine feeding. 12 And all the devils beſought him, ſaying, Send us into the ſwine, that we may enter into them. 13 And forthwith Jeſus gave them leave. And the unclean ſpirits went out, and entered into the ſwine, and the herd ran violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down a ſteep place into the ſea, (they were about two thouſand) and were choked in the ſea. 14 And they that fed the ſwine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to ſee what it was that was done. 15 And they come to Jeſus, and ſee him that was poſſeſſed with the devil, and had the legion, ſitting, and clothed, and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 16 And they that ſaw it, told them how it befel to him that was poſſeſſed with the devil, and alſo concerning the ſwine. 17 And they began to pray him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their coaſts. 18 And when he was come into the ſhip, he that had been poſſeſſed with the devil, prayed him that he might be with him. 19 Howbeit, Jeſus ſuffered him not, but ſaith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compaſſion on thee. 20 And he departed, and began to publiſh in Decapolis, how great things Jeſus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</p>
               <p>This piece of Hiſtory gives us a very ſad Relation of a Perſon that was poſſeſſed with a Legion of Devils; we read of few, if any, in the Old Teſtament, that were thus poſſeſs'd, but of many in the New Teſtament. Our Saviour came into the World to deſtroy the Works of the Devil; therefore he ſuffered Satan to enter ſome humane Bodies, to ſhew his Divine Power in caſting him out. <hi>Note</hi> here, 1. That the evil Angels by their Fall loſt their Purity, but not their Power; for with God's Permiſſion they have Power, not only to enter into Men's Bodies, and to poſſeſs them, but alſo to diſtemper their Minds, and drive them to Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and Madneſs; cauſing them to offer Violence to their own Lives, and to do Hurt and Miſchief to their own Bodies. Thus did this poſſeſſed Perſon here, wounding and cutting himſelf with Stones. <hi>Note</hi> 2. That the Reaſon why the evil Angels do no oftner exert their Power in doing Miſchief to the Bodies and Lives of Men, is from the reſtraining Power of God. The Devils cannot do all the Miſchief they would, and they ſhall not do all they can. <hi>Note</hi> 3. The Place where theſe evil Spirits delighted to make their Abode, <hi>amongſt the Tombs,</hi> or Graves, places deſolate, forlorn and ſolitary, which are apt to breed Horror of Mind, and give Advantage to Temptations. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That it is dangerous, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſafe, for Perſons, eſpecially in whom Melancholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, to give themſelves to Solitarineſs, to frequent deſolate and forlorn Places, and to affect the being much alone, it giving Advantage to Satan to ſet upon them with powerful Temptations. It is better to frequent Humane Society, and eſpecially to delight in the Society and Communion of the Saints, by means whereof we may be more and more ſtrengthned and fortified againſt Satan's Temptations. <hi>Note</hi> 4. That the Devils own Chriſt to be the Son of God,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:55"/> and that he came into the World to be a Saviour, but not a Saviour to them; therefore they cry our, <hi>What have we to do with thee?</hi> Or thou with us? Oh! what an uncomfortable Confeſſion and Acknowledgment is this, to own Chriſt to be a Saviour, and at the ſame time to know that he is none of our Saviour. <hi>Note</hi> 5. That tho' the Devils do own Chriſt to be the Son of God, and do pay Homage and Worſhip, and yeild Service and Subjection to him as his Slaves and Vaſſals, yet it is not a free and voluntary Service, but extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted father, and forced from them by the Power of Chriſt. <hi>He worſhipped, and cried out, ſaying, What have I to do with thee? Note</hi> 6. What a Multitude of evil Spirits did enter into one Man? Oh the extream Malice and Cruelty of the Devil againſt Mankind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in that ſo many evil Spirits did at once afflict and torment a ſingle Perſon, even a <hi>Legion,</hi> many Thouſands of them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> alſo, The Unity and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is amongſt theſe evil Spirits, in doing Miſchief, tho' there was a <hi>Legion</hi> of them in this one Perſon, yet they have all but one Name. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the very Devils have a ſort of Unity amongſt themſelves, and in their Malice and miſchievous Deſigns againſt Mankind they are as one. How happy were it, if good Men were as much united in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Endeavours for the Glory of God, as Devils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and combine againſt it. <hi>Note</hi> 7. The Outcry which the Devil makes at the Appearance and Approach of Chriſt. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> From thence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That there are Tortures appointed to the Spiritual Natures of evil Angels. 2. That the Devils are not ſo full of Torment as they ſhall be. Altho' they are as full of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content as they can be, there will be a Time when their Torments ſhall be encreaſed, when they ſhall have their Fill of torment. This they know, and accordingly thus they pray, <hi>Torment us not before our Time.</hi> That is, encreaſe not our Torments before the appointed time of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. <hi>Note</hi> 8. The Devils Requeſt for Permiſſion and Leave to go into the Herd of Swine. Where <hi>Obſerve, Firſt,</hi> The Devil's Malice; he will hurt the poor Beaſts, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not hurt at all. <hi>Secondly,</hi> His powerful Reſtraint; he cannot hurt a Pig without a Permiſſion. <hi>Suffer us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Satan's Malice indeed is infinite, but his Power is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is <hi>Poteſtas ſub poteſtate, A Power under a Power.</hi> If he could not hurt the Swine, much leſs can he afflict the Body or Soul of Man without Leave and Licence. <hi>Note</hi> 9. How Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Requeſt is yeilded to by our Saviour, he permits the Devils to enter into the Swine; not to ſatisfie their Deſire in doing Miſchief. But <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew his Power over the Devils, that they could do nothing without his Permiſſion; <hi>Next,</hi> To ſhew how great the Power and Malice of the Devil would be, if not reſtrained; and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the Miracle of caſting out ſuch a Multitude of Devils, might appear to be the greater. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſometimes Almighty God, for wiſe Ends, and juſt Cauſes, doth ſuffer the Devil to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his Deſire, in doing Hurt and Miſchief unto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, Go. Note</hi> 10. What a contrary Effect this Miracle which Chriſt wrought, had upon theſe People, inſtead of believing his Divine Power, upon the Sight of his miraculous healing the poſſeſſed, the Loſs of their Swine enrages them, and makes them deſire Chriſt to depart from them: Carnal Hearts preferr their Swine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Saviour, and had rather loſe Chriſt's Preſence than their Worldly Profit. So deſirous were theſe <hi>Gadarens</hi> to get rid of our Saviour's Company, <hi>that they pray and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to depart out of their Coaſts. Learn hence,</hi> Sad is the Condition of ſuch from whom Chriſt departs, more ſad the Condition of ſuch who ſay unto Chriſt, Depart; but moſt ſad the Caſe of them who pray and beſeech Chriſt to depart from them. Thus did theſe <hi>Gadarens</hi> deſire and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Chriſt to depart from them, which accordingly he did, and we read no more of his Return to them. <hi>Note laſtly,</hi> How deſirous the poſſeſſed Man was to continue with Chriſt, after he was come to himſelf. <hi>He prayed that he might be with him.</hi> This he might deſire, partly to teſtifie his Thankfulneſs to Chriſt, partly out of fear of being repoſſeſs'd again by Satan, or perhaps to have the Opportunity of hearing Chriſt's Doctrine, and ſeeing his Miracles: For ſuch as have once <hi>taſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> and experienced the Pleaſure and Profit of Chriſt's Company, are very deſirous of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, and exceeding loth to part with it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Saviour at this time did not think fit to ſuffer him, knowing that more Glory would redound to God, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this Miracle to his Friends: Chriſt expects after emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Deliverances wrought for us, that we ſhould be the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of his Praiſes, and declare to all, far and near, the great things which God hath done for us.</p>

How readily our Saviour complies with <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. <hi>Jeſus went with him.</hi> Altho' his Faith was but weak, yet our Saviour doth not reject him, or deny his Sute, but readily goes with him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> How ready we ſhould be to go to Chriſt in all our Diſtreſſes, Afflictions, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, who is ſo ready to hear, and ſo forward to help us, if we ſeek him in Sincerity, tho' our Faith be feeble. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3.

How free was thy Converſation from Pride and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs: How willing to converſe with the meaneſt of the People for their Advantage. Our Lord did not only ſuffer them to come near him, but even to throng him: What an Example is here for the greateſt Perſons upon Earth to imitate and follow, not to deſpiſe the Perſons, nor diſdain the Preſence of the meaneſt and pooreſt of the People; but to look upon ſome with an Eye of Favour, upon others with an Eye of Pity, upon none with an Eye of Contempt.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And a certain woman which had an iſſue of blood twelve years, 26 And had ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of many phyſicians, and had ſpent all that ſhe had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worſe, 27 When ſhe had heard of Jeſus, came in the preſs behind, and touched his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 28 For ſhe ſaid, If I may touch but his cloaths, I ſhall be whole. 29 And ſtraightway the fountain of her blood was dried up: and ſhe felt in her body that ſhe was healed of that plague. 30 And Jeſus immediately knowing in himſelf, that vertue had gone out of him, turned him about in the preſs, and ſaid, Who touched my cloaths? 31 And his diſciples ſaid unto him, Thou ſeeſt the multitude thronging thee, and ſayeſt thou, Who touched me? 32 And he looked round about to ſee her that had done this thing. 33 But the woman fearing and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 34 And he ſaid unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:46556:56"/> 6 And he marvelled, becauſe of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having in the former Chapter wrought two famous Miracles, in curing a Woman of her Bloody Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and raiſing <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daughter from Death, we find him here in the beginning of this Chapter paſſing <hi>into his own Country;</hi> that is, to the City of <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his own City and Country, becauſe he was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, there brought up, there <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> and his Kindred dwelt, and Chriſt with them during his private Life, which was till he was Thirty Years of Age. Now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour being come into his own Country; <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. What his imployment was; he preach'd in their Synagogues, and held Communion with the Jewiſh Church, altho' ſhe had many Corruptions in her. <hi>Teaching</hi> us by his Example, not to deſert and forſake the Communion of ſuch a Church, in which there is found neither Heretical Doctrine, nor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worſhip; altho' many things be found in her, culpable and blame-worthy. The Jewiſh Church was certainly ſuch, and yet our Saviour maintained not occaſional only, but conſtant Communion with her. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Influence and Effect which our Saviour's preaching had upon his own Countrymen, the People of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> it did work Admiration in them, but not Faith; <hi>they were aſtoniſhed,</hi> but did not believe. Men may be mightily moved and affected by the Word, and yet may never be converted by it; the Men of <hi>Nazareth</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and yet were offended; they did not believe in him, but were offended at him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Ground and Cauſe of this their Offence, and that was the Meaneſs of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and the Poverty of his Condition; <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> From whence the ancient Fathers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> concluded, that our Saviour did work upon his Father <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Trade during his Father's Life, and thence was called <hi>the Carpenter's Son;</hi> and when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, (which was before Chriſt was Thirty Years old, when he entered upon his Publick Office) he was then called <hi>the Carpenter.</hi> The Antients ſay, he ſpent his time in making Ploughs and Yoaks, and that thence it was that he drew ſo many Similitudes in his Preaching from the Yoak and the Plough. This we are ſure of, that our Lord lived not Thirty Years before his Manifeſtation, idly and unprofitably. It is moſt probable, that he followed his Father's Calling, and wrought under him, it being ſaid, that <hi>he was ſubject to him, Luke</hi> 2.15. as a Child to a Parent, and as a Servant to his Maſter. Indeed after he entred upon his Prophetick Office, he no longer followed <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Calling, but apply'd himſelf wholly to the Work of the Miniſtry. He made no more Ploughs, but one to break up hard Hearts; no more Yoaks, but one for the Devil's Neck. However, in regard of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's low Extraction, and mean Education, <hi>His Countrymen were offended at him. Learn hence,</hi> That the Poverty and Meaneſs of Chriſt's Condition was that which Multitudes ſtumbled at, and which kept many, yea, moſt from believing on him. None but a Spiritual Eye can diſcern Beauty in an humbled and abaſed Saviour. <hi>Learn</hi> 2dly, That it is the Property and Practice of prophane Men to take occaſion from the outward Quality and Condition of God's Miniſters, both to deſpiſe their Perſons, and to reject their Doctrine. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Reaſon aſſigned by our Saviour why the Men of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> deſpiſed him, and ſet him at nought, becauſe he was their Countryman and Acquaintance, their Familiarity bred Contempt. <hi>Teaching</hi> us, That very often the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God are moſt contemned and diſhonoured, where they are moſt familiarly known. Sometimes the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their mean Original and Extraction, ſometimes the Poverty of their Parent's Condition, ſometimes the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of their Childhood, ſometimes the Follies of their Youth are ript up; all which are Occaſions of Contempt, and gave Ground for this proverbial Saying, <hi>That a Prophet is not without Honour, ſave in his own Country.</hi> Which, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proverbial Speeches, holds true in the general, that for the moſt part it is ſo, but it is not univerſally true in all Perſons and Caſes. However this good uſe may be made of our Saviour's Obſervation, to teach his Miniſters to be wiſe, in converſing with their People; not to make themſelves cheap, and common in every Company, nor too familiar with all ſorts of Perſons, nor to be light and vain in any Company; for this will certainly breed Contempt both of their Perſons and Miniſtry. Our Duty is, by Strictneſs and Gravity of Deportment to maintain our Eſteem in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of our People, and to temper Gravity with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending Affability. That Miniſter which proſtitutes his Authority, fruſtrates the Ends of his Miniſtry, and is the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his own Contempt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. How this People's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſt's Perſon, and Unbelief of this Doctrine, did hinder Chriſt from working Miracles amongſt them. <hi>He could do no mighty Works there.</hi> Not becauſe he was unable, but they were unwilling. This Inability proceeded from no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Chriſt's Power, but from a Defect in their Faith. He could not, becauſe he would not; and he would not, becauſe it was not fit for him ſo to do. Altho' Chriſt be Omnipotent, and has all Power in his Hand, yet Unbelief binds his Hands, and hinders him in the Execution of that Power. Unbelief is ſuch a Sin as keeps Men from being Partakers of the Benefits of Chriſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. How the Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Unbelief of this People was ſo great, that Chriſt wondred at it. <hi>He marvelled becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> Not becauſe he was ignorant of the Cauſe of it, but becauſe he had uſed ſuch marvellous Means for the curing them of their Unbelief. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Unbelief is a great Sin at all times; but when Marvels are wrought for the cure and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and it remains uncured; it is a marvellous Sin, and juſtly cauſes Admiration and Wonder in Chriſt himſelf. <hi>He marvelled becauſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi>

               <p n="7">7 And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to ſend them forth by two and two, and gave them power over unclean ſpirits, 8 And commanded them that they ſhould take nothing for their journey, ſave a ſtaff only: no ſcrip, no bread, no money in their purſe: 9 But be ſhod with ſandals: and not put on two coats. 10 And he ſaid unto them, In what place ſoever ye enter into an houſe, there abide till ye depart from that place. 11 And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, ſhake off the duſt under your feet for a teſtimony againſt them. Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, then for that city. 12 And they went out, and preached that men ſhould repent. 13 And they caſt out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were ſick, and healed them.</p>
               <p>We heard before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. of our Saviour's ſolemn calling his Apoſtles to their Work and Office, now he ſends them forth to execute their Office. Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſends them forth, <hi>Christ. Learn thence,</hi> That none ought to take upon them the Office of Preaching, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſterial Function in the Church, till thereunto law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called by Chriſt himſelf. The Apoſtles were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately called and ſent forth by Chriſt himſelf, and received the Doctrine which they taught immediately from Chriſt's own Mouth. His Miniſters now are called mediately, they receive their Authority from Chriſt by the Hands of the Governours of his Church. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The manner of their ſending, by Two and Two in a Company, partly to make their Meſſage of more Authority; partly to teſtifie their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conſent in the Doctrine which they taught; and partly, to comfort and encourage, to help and ſtrengthen, to aſſiſt and ſupport each other; in Imitation of this Example the Jeſuits ſend forth their Emiſſaries by Pairs. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Miniſters of the Word do ſtand in great need of the mutual Help and Comfort, of the united Aſſiſtance and Encouragement of each other in the weighty Duties of their Calling and Function; like Labourers in the Harveſt-Field they ſhould help one another, the ſtrong endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtrengthen the Hands of the Weak. But, Lord, what Tears are ſufficient to bewail the Want of Love and Unity, yea, the Prevalency of that Envy and Malignity which is found too often amongſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel; ſo that inſtead of going forth Two by Two, happy is he that is alone in a Place. Well might <hi>Melancthon</hi> bleſs God, when he lay a dying, that he was going to a Place where he ſhould be free from the implacable Hatred of Divines. This is and ought to be for a Lamentation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Power given by Chriſt to work Miracles for confirming the Doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:46556:57"/> the Goſpel which his Apoſtles preached; he gave them Power over unclean Spirits, and they caſt out Devils, and anointed with Oil them that were ſick, and healed them. This Power to work Miracles was neceſſary for the Apoſtles; partly, to procure Reverence to their Perſons, being poor and unlearned Men, but principally to gain Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to their Doctrine; for the Doctrine of Faith in the Meſſiah as now come and exhibited in the Fleſh, being a ſtrange and new Doctrine to the <hi>Jews;</hi> the Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it was to be extraordinarily ratified by Chriſt and his Apoſtles Miracles. Some of which were caſting out of Devils; and by anointing with Oil to heal and recover ſick Perſons. This Gift of healing remained ſome time in the Church, as appears from St. <hi>James</hi> 5.14. <hi>Is any ſick, anoint him with Oil in the Name of the Lord?</hi> Where obſerve, that the Apoſtles did not uſe Oil as the Inſtrument and Means of healing (for then the Cure had not been miraculous) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Symbol of the Cure, or as an outward Sign and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of miraculous healing; which outward Sign was for the ſtrengthning of the Faith of ſuch as were healed; aſſuring them, that as certainly as their Bodies were anointed, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhould their Health and Strength be reſtored. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts upon this ground their Sacrament of <hi>Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> but very vainly; for the Apoſtles anointed thoſe that were ſick as a Sign of their Recovery; but the Papiſts anoint thoſe that have the Pangs of Death upon them; that their Sins may be blotted out, and the Snares of the Devil avoided. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Charge given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles at the time of their ſending out. This is threefold: <hi>First,</hi> Touching their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for their Journey; he bids them not take much Care, nor ſpend much Time in furniſhing themſelves with Victuals, Money, Apparel, Weapons of Defence, and the like, only take a Walking-Staff in their Hands, becauſe they were to finiſh their Journey ſpeedily, and to return again to Chriſt. This Command of our Saviour to his Apoſtles, not to incumber themſelves when going forth to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Teaches</hi> his Miniſters their Duty, to free themſelves as much as poſſibly they can from Worldly Incumbrances, which may hinder them in the Performance of their Office and Function. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>No Man that warreth, intangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life. Secondly,</hi> Touching their Lodging in their Journey. Our Saviour adviſes them not to change it during their ſtay in one Place; but <hi>into whatſoever Houſe they first entred, they ſhould there continue till they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of that place.</hi> That ſo they might avoid all ſhew of Lightneſs and Inconſtancy, and teſtifie all Gravity and Stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in their Behaviour. This being a ſpecial Means to win Authority to their Perſons and Miniſtry. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt gives a Charge to his Apoſtles touching their Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as ſhould refuſe to give Entertainment to them and their Doctrine. They were to denounce the Judgments of God againſt ſuch Contemners, <hi>by ſhaking off the Duſt of their Feet for a Teſtimony againſt them. Thence Learn,</hi> That the Contempt of God's Miniſters, and eſpecially of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Doctrine, is an odious and execrable Sin deteſted by God, and which ought to be abhorred by Man. <hi>Shake off the Dust of your Feet.</hi> This Action was Emblematical, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that Almighty God would in like manner ſhake them off as the vileſt Duſt. <hi>Learn</hi> 2dly, That where-ever the Word is preached, it is for a Teſtimony, either a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for or againſt a People. For if the Duſt of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Feet bear Witneſs againſt the Deſpiſers of the Goſpel, their Sermons much more. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> The dreadful Judgment denounced by our Saviour againſt the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Apoſtle's Doctrine. <hi>Verily it ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the Day of Judgment than for that City.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That there ſhall be a Day of Judgment. 2. That in the Day of Judgment ſome Sinners ſhall fare worſe than others. 3. That of all Sinners the Condition of ſuch will be ſaddeſt at the Day of Judgment, who having lived under the Goſpel, have died after all in Impenitency and Infidelity. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you it will be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>than, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="14">14 And king Herod heard <hi>of him,</hi> (for his name was ſpread abroad) and he ſaid, That John the Baptiſt was riſen from the dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mighty works do ſhew forth themſelves in him. 15 Others ſaid, That it is Elias. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaid, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 16 But when Herod heard <hi>thereof,</hi> he ſaid, It is John whom I beheaded, he is riſen from the dead. 17 For Herod himſelf had ſent forth, and laid hold upon John, and bound him in priſon for Herodias ſake, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her. 18 For John had ſaid unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife. 19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel againſt him, and would have killed him, but ſhe could not. 20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a juſt man and an holy, and obſerved him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birth day made a ſupper to his lords, high captains, and chief eſtates of Galilee: 22 And when the daughter of the ſaid Herodias came in, and danced, and pleaſed Herod, and them that ſat with him, the king ſaid unto the damſel, Ask of me whatſoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. 23 And he ſware unto her, Whatſoever thou ſhalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. 24 And ſhe went forth, and ſaid unto her mother, What ſhall I ask? And ſhe ſaid, The head of John the Baptiſt. 25 And ſhe came in ſtraightway with haſte unto the king, and asked, ſaying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger, the head of John the Baptiſt. 26 And the king was exceeding ſorry, <hi>yet</hi> for his oaths ſake, and for their ſakes which ſat with him, he would not reject her. 27 And immediately the king ſent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went, and beheaded him in the priſon, 28 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damſel: and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel gave it to her mother. 29 And when his diſciples heard <hi>of it,</hi> they came and took up his corps, and laid it in a tomb.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's Death is here recorded by this Evangeliſt, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had done before, <hi>Ch.</hi> 14.1, 2. here we have theſe Particulars farther <hi>obſervable:</hi> 1.

The Crown and Scepter of <hi>Herod</hi> could not daunt the faithful Meſſenger of God. There ought to meet in the Miniſters of God both Courage and Impartiality. Courage, in fearing no Faces, Impartiality, in ſparing no Sins. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Who it was that commanded the Baptiſt to be beheaded. It was <hi>Herod the King whom he had reproved.</hi> How ſad is it when Kings, who ſhould be Nurſing-fathers to the Church, do prove the bloody Butchers of the Prophets of God. The ſevereſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions which the Prophets of God have fallen under, are uſually occaſioned by their telling great Men of their Crimes. Men in Power are impatient of Reproof, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that their Authority gives them a Licenſe to tranſgreſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The time of the Baptiſt's Death. <hi>It was upon</hi> Herod<hi>'s Birth-Day.</hi> It was an ancient Cuſtom among the Eaſtern Kings to celebrate their Birth Days; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. and <hi>Herod</hi> here, but both with Blood; yet theſe perſonal Stains do not make the Practice unlawful when we ſolemnize our Birth-Days with Thankfulneſs to our Creator and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and recommend our ſelves by Prayer to his Gracious Providence and Protection for the Remainder of our Days. This is an Act of Piety and Religion. But <hi>Herod</hi>'s Birth-Day was kept with Revelling, with Feaſting, with Muſick and Dancing.

St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>Herod</hi> might have ſpared the Baptiſt's Head, and yet have kept his Oath to <hi>Herodias;</hi> for he ſware to give her only half of his Kingdom, and his Head was worth more than his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 2. Reſpect to his Reputation, not only for his Oath's ſake, but <hi>for them that ſat with him.</hi> They heard him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and will be Witneſſes of his Inconſtancy if he do not perform: Inſiſting upon Punctilio's of Honour has hazarded the Loſs of Millions of Souls. 3. His great Unwillingneſs to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Herodias,</hi> and her Daughter. Oh vain and fooliſh Hypocrite, who dreaded the diſpleaſing of a wanton Miſtreſs, more than the offending of God and Conſcience! <hi>Obſ.</hi> 7. Theſe bloody Women do not only require the Baptiſt to be beheaded, but <hi>that his Head be brought in a Charger</hi> to them. What a Diſh was here to be ſerved up at a Prince's Table on his Birth-Day! A dead Man's Head ſwimming in Blood. How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly inſatiable is Cruelty and Revenge? <hi>Herodias</hi> did not think her ſelf ſafe till <hi>John</hi> was dead; ſhe would not think him dead till his Head was off, and would not believe his Head off till the had it in her Hand. Revenge never thinks it has made ſure enough. Oh how cruel is a wicked Heart, that could take Pleaſure in a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of ſo much Horror! Methinks I ſee how that holy Head was toſs'd upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s Table by impure and filthy Hands. That true and faithful Tongue, thoſe ſacred Lips, thoſe chaſte Eyes, thoſe mortified Cheeks are now inſultingly handled by a lewd and inceſtuous Harlot, and made a Scorn to <hi>Herod</hi>'s drunken Gueſts. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 8. That neither the Holieſt of the Prophets, nor the Beſt of Men, are more ſecure from Violence, than from natural Death. The Holy Baptiſt, who was ſanctified in the Womb, conceived and born with ſo much Miracle, lived with ſo much Reverence and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is now at Midnight obſcurely murthered in a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 9. That it is as true a Martyrdom to ſuffer for Duty, as for Faith. He dies as truly a Martyr that dies for doing his Duty, as he that dies for profeſſing his Faith, and bearing Witneſs to the Truth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 10. How far Men may go in Religion, and yet be far enough from ſaving Grace; they may reverence God's Miniſters, believe them to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſt Men, hear them with Delight and Pleaſure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend them from their Oppoſers, they may <hi>reform and do many things,</hi> and <hi>yet be far from the Kingdom of God. Herod</hi> did all this, he knew <hi>John</hi> to be an holy and juſt Man, reverenced and reſpected him, guarded and kept him ſafe from <hi>Herodias</hi> Malice. For tho' he was impriſon'd before, yet <hi>Herod</hi> ſuffered none to hurt him, but heard him often with Pleaſure and Delight. Wicked and unregenerate Men may be ſo affected with the Word of God, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Protectors and Defenders of thoſe that diſpence it, and yet receive no ſaving Advantage by it. The plain and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful preaching of the Word may win upon, and prevail with an unregenerate Man to perform many good Duties, and to forſake many known Sins, and yet may he after all remain under the Power of Hypocriſie. Nay, from <hi>Herod</hi>'s Example we may <hi>Learn,</hi> That a wicked Man may take ſome Pleaſure and Delight in hearing the Word preached, either the Generality of the Truths aſſerted, or the Novelty of the Notions delivered, or the Wit and Fancy. The graceful Elocution and Delivery, of the Preacher, may create a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Delight, but it is neither a Spiritual Delight, nor an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Delight. <hi>And when his Diſciples heard of it, they came and took up his Corps, and laid it in a Tomb. When his Diſciples heard it:</hi> That is, the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> hearing that their holy Maſter was thus barbarouſly murthered, they took up his dead Body, and decently interr'd it. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the faithful Servants of God are not aſhamed of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Saints, but will teſtifie their Reſpects unto them, both living, dying, and dead, the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> give their Maſter an honourable and reſpectful Burial. Fearing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Herod</hi>'s Power, nor <hi>Herodias</hi>'s Malice.</p>
               <p n="30">30 And the Apoſtles gathered themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto Jeſus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. 31 And he ſaid unto them, Come ye your ſelves apart into a deſert place, and reſt a while. For there were many coming and going; and they had no leiſure ſo much as to eat. 32 And they departed into a deſert place by ſhip pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately. 33 And the people ſaw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto him. 34 And Jeſus, when he came out, ſaw much people, and was moved with compaſſion towards them, becauſe they were as ſheep not having a ſhepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Report of <hi>John</hi>'s Death being brought to Chriſt, he preſently withdraws, and his Diſciples with him from that Place into the Deſert. Chriſt will not long continue his Preſence in thoſe Places, where any of his Servants are ſlain, and others of them are in Danger. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How our Saviour upon the Notice of <hi>John</hi>'s Death flies into the Deſert for his own Preſervation: <hi>His Hour was not yet come,</hi> and therefore he keeps out of <hi>Herod</hi>'s way. It is no Cowardice to fly from the Rage of Perſecutors. Chriſt himſelf both practiced it, and directs his Diſciples to it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>When they perſecute you in one City, fly to another.</hi> We muſt not expoſe our Lives to Hazard, but when the laying down our Lives will do God and Religion more Service than we can do by living. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. With what Condolency and Sympathizing Pity our Bleſſed Saviour exerciſed Acts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Compaſſion, when the Objects of Compaſſion were before him. <hi>Jeſus ſeeing the Multitude was moved with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them.</hi> Chriſt, when here on Earth, did bear a tender and compaſſionate Heart towards poor Creatures in Diſtreſs and Miſery; and to our Comfort he retains the ſame compaſſionate Nature and Diſpoſition now in Heaven which he had hereon Earth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Ground or Cauſe of this Compaſſion in our Saviour, becauſe <hi>they were as Sheep, having no Shepherd. Learn thence,</hi> That the Caſe of ſuch a People is very ſad, and to their Condition be much lamented and pitied, who are deſtitute of able, faithful, and conſcientious Paſtors and Teachers to feed them with the Spiritual Food of the Word and Sacraments. Where Viſion fails, the People periſh. But was the Jewiſh Church now without Paſtors, as Sheep without a Shepherd? Had they not the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and Doctors to teach and inſtruct them? Yes, no doubt, but they were no Paſtors in Chriſt's Account, becauſe unfaithful Paſtors. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That idle, negligent, and unfaithful Paſtors, are no Paſtors in the Sight of God, and in the Account of Chriſt. <hi>Jeſus had Compaſſion on the Multitude, becauſe they were as Sheep, having no Shepherd.</hi>

               <p n="35">35 And when the day was now far ſpent, his diſciples came unto him, and ſaid, This is a deſart place, and now the time is far paſſed: 36 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themſelves bread: for they have nothing to eat. 37 He anſwered and ſaid unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they ſay unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred penyworth of bread, and give them to eat? 38 He ſaith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and ſee. And when they knew, they ſay, Five and two fiſhes. 39 And he commanded them to make all ſit down by companies upon the green graſs. 40 And they ſat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 41 And when he had taken the
<pb facs="tcp:46556:58"/> five loaves and the two fiſhes, he looked up to heaven, and bleſſed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his diſciples to ſet before them; and the two fiſhes divided he among them all. 42 And they did all eat, and were filled. 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fiſhes. 44 And they that did eat of the loaves, were about five thouſand men.</p>
               <p>This Miracle of our Saviour's feeding Five Thouſand Men, beſides Women and Children, with Five Loaves and Two Fiſhes, is recorded by all Four Evangeliſts, and in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it theſe following Particulars, are <hi>obſervable. Note</hi> 1. The Diſciples Pity towards the Multitude, who had long faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wanted now the ordinary Comforts and Supports of Life. It well becomes the Miniſters of Chriſt to reſpect the Bodily Neceſſities, as well as regard the Spiritual Wants of Perſons. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Motion which the Diſciples make to Chriſt on Behalf of the Multitude. <hi>Send them away, that they may buy Victuals.</hi> Here was a ſtrong Charity, but a weak Faith. A ſtrong Charity, in deſiring the People's Relief; but a weak Faith, in ſuppoſing that they could not otherwiſe be relieved, but by ſending them away; forgetting, that Chriſt, who had healed the Multitude miraculouſly, could alſo feed them miraculouſly, if he pleaſed. All things being equally eaſie to an Almighty Power. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Our Saviour's ſtrange Reply to the Diſciple's Requeſt; <hi>They need not depart, give ye them to eat.</hi> Need not depart? Why, the People muſt either feed or famiſh. Victuals they muſt have, and a dry Deſart will afford none, yet ſays Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Give ye them to eat.</hi> Alas poor Diſciples, they had nothing for themſelves to eat, how then ſhould they give the Multitude to eat? When Chriſt requires of us what we are unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, it is to ſhew us our Impotency and Weakneſs, and to provoke us to look up to him, and depend by Faith on his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. What a poor and ſlender Proviſion the Lord of the whole Earth has for his Houſhold and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. <hi>Five Barley Loaves, and Two ſmall Fiſhes. Teaching</hi> us, That theſe Bodies of ours muſt be fed, but not pumper'd; our Belly muſt not be our Maſter, much leſs our God. The end of Food is to ſuſtain Nature, we muſt not ſtifle it with a Gluttonous Variety. And as the Quality of the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als was plain, ſo the Quantity of it was ſmall. <hi>Five Loaves and Two Fiſhes.</hi> Well might the Diſciples ſay, <hi>What are theſe among ſo many?</hi> The Eye of Senſe and Reaſon ſees an utter Impoſſibility of thoſe Effects which Faith can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly apprehend, and Divine Power more eaſily produce. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. How Chriſt, the great Maſter of the Feaſt, doth marſhal his Gueſts: <hi>He commands them all to ſit down in Ranks by Hundreds, and by Fifties.</hi> None of them reply, Sit down, but to what? Here are the Mouths, but where's the Meat. We may ſoon be ſet, but when, or whence ſhall we be ſerv'd? Not a Word like this, but they obey and expect. Lord, how eaſie is it to truſt thy Providence, and rely upon thy Power, when there is Corn in the Barn, Bread in the Cupboard, or Money in the Purſe; but when our Stores are all empty, and we have nothing in Hand, then to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an inviſible Bounty, is a true and noble Act of Faith. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. The Actions performed by our Bleſſed Saviour. <hi>He bleſſed, and brake, and gave the Loaves to his Diſciples, and they to the Multitude.</hi> 1. <hi>He bleſſed</hi> them. <hi>Teaching</hi> us by his Example, never to uſe or receive the good Creatures of God for our Nouriſhment without Prayers and Praiſe. Never to ſit down to our Food as a Beaſt to his Forage. 2. <hi>He brake</hi> the Loaves. He could have multiplied them whole, why then would he rather do it in the breaking? Perhaps to teach us, that we may rather expect his Bleſſing in the Diſtribution of his Bounty, than in the Reſervation of it. Scattering is the way to encreaſing; Liberality is the way to Riches. 3. Chriſt <hi>gave</hi> the Bread thus broken <hi>to his Diſciples,</hi> that they might diſtribute it <hi>to the Multitude.</hi> But why did our Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the Loaves by his Diſciple's Hands? Doubtleſs to gain Reſpect to his Diſciples from the People. And the ſame Courſe doth our Lord take in Spiritual Diſtributions. He that could feed the World by his own immediate Hand, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes rather by the Hand of his Miniſters to divide the Bread of Life amongſt his People. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 7. The Certainty and the Greatneſs of the Miracle. <hi>They did all eat, and were filled.</hi> They did all eat, not a Crumb, or a Bit, but to Satiety and Fulneſs. All that were hungry did eat, and all that did eat were ſatisfied, and yet <hi>Twelve Baskets of Fragments remain.</hi> More is left than was at firſt ſet on. 'Tis hard to ſay which was the greateſt Miracle, the miraculous Eating, or the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Leaving. If we conſider what they eat, we may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they left any thing; if what they left, that they eat any thing. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 8. Theſe Fragments, tho' of Barley Loaves and Fiſh Bones, muſt not be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh how tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous will their Account be, who having large and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eſtates, ſpend them upon their Luſts, being worſe than loſt in God's Account!</p>
               <p n="45">45 And ſtraightway he conſtrained his diſciples to get into the ſhip, and to go to the other ſide before unto Bethſaida, while he ſent away the people. 46 And when he had ſent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. 47 And when even was come, the ſhip was in the midſt of the ſea, and he alone on the land. 48 And he ſaw them toiling in rowing: (for the wind was contrary unto them) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh unto them walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſea, and would have paſſed by them. 49 But when they ſaw him walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea, they ſuppoſed it had been a ſpirit, and cried out. 50 (For they all ſaw him, and were troubled) and immediately he talked with them, and ſaith unto them, Be of good cheer, it is I, be not afraid. 51 And he went up unto them into the ſhip, and the wind ceaſed: and they were ſore amazed in themſelves beyond meaſure, and wondered. 52 For they conſidered not <hi>the miracle</hi> of the loaves, for their heart was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.</p>
               <p>This Paragraph acquaints us with another Miracle, which our Saviour wrought, <hi>in walking upon the Sea to his Diſciples;</hi> and herein we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> 1. His ſending his Diſciples to Sea, <hi>he conſtrained them to go into a Ship;</hi> not compelling them againſt their Wills, but commanding them to take Ship, and <hi>go before him.</hi> No doubt the Diſciples were loth to this, unwilling to leave him, and to go without him; for they that have once taſted the Sweetneſs of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Acquaintance, are hardly and difficultly drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Chriſt having diſmiſt his Diſciples and the Company, retires <hi>into a Mountain to pray;</hi> to teach us, that when we addreſs our ſelves to God in Duty, to take all Helps, Furtherances, and Advantages for the doing of our Duty. We muſt diſmiſs the Multitude before we addreſs to God in Prayer; we muſt ſend away the Multitude of worldly Cares, worldly Thoughts, worldly Concerns and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when we would wait upon God in Duty. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The great Danger the Diſciples were in, and the Difficulties they were to encounter with. <hi>They were in the midſt of the Sea, toſſed with the Waves, and the Winds were contrary;</hi> and which was ſaddeſt of all, Chriſt was abſent. The Wiſdom of God ſometimes ſuffers his Children and People not only to be diſtreſſed, but greatly diſtreſſed, with a variety of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The ſeaſonable Succour and Relief which Chriſt afforded his Diſciples. <hi>In the fourth Watch he came unto them, walking upon the Waters.</hi> It was not a ſtormy and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Sea that could ſeparate betwixt him and them; he that waded thro' a Sea of Blood, and a Sea of Wrath, to ſave his People, will walk upon a Sea of Waters to ſuccour and relieve them. And the time was the <hi>fourth Watch,</hi> about Four in the Morning, when they had been many Hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting with the Waves, and in great Danger of their Lives. To <hi>Teach</hi> us, that Chriſt ſometimes lengthens out the Trials of his Children before he delivers them; but when they come to an Extremity, that is, the Seaſon of his Succour. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. How the Diſciples took their Deliverer for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer. <hi>When they ſaw Chriſt, they cried out.</hi> Their Fears were higheſt when their Deliverer and Deliverance was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; God may be coming with Salvation and Deliverance to his People, when they for the preſent cannot diſcern it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. When the Diſciples were in the ſuddeſt Condition,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:58"/> one word from Chriſt revives them; it is a ſufficient ſupport in all our Afflictions, to hear Chriſt's Voice ſpeaking to us, and to enjoy his favourable Preſence with us. Say but, Oh Saviour, <hi>(it is I)</hi> and then let Evils do their worſt: That one word <hi>(it is I)</hi> is ſufficient to allay all Storms, and to calm a Thouſand Tempeſts. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, What Influence and Effect this Miracle had upon the Diſciples, <hi>They were ſore amazed, and beyond meaſure aſtoniſhed;</hi> they wonder at the ceaſing of the Winds, and calming of the Seas; but <hi>they had forgotten the Miracles of the Loaves,</hi> which was a great Stupidity and Dulneſs in them, and argued Hardneſs of Heart, and want of Conſideration in them. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That there is much Stupidity of Mind, and Hardneſs of Heart, remaining unmortified in the beſt of Saints, whilſt here in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State; the work of Grace and Sanctification is but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect here.</p>
               <p n="53">53 And when they had paſſed over, they came into the land of Geneſareth, and drew to the ſhore. 54 And when they were come out of the ſhip, ſtraightway they knew him, 55 And ran thorow that whole region round about; and began to carry about in beds thoſe that were ſick, where they heard he was. 56 And whitherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he entered, into villages, or cities, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they laid the ſick in the ſtreets, and beſought him that they might touch, if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> 1. The unwearied Diligence and Induſtry of our Saviour in going about to do good: He no ſooner land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but goeth to <hi>Geneſareth,</hi> and healeth their Sick. It was the Great Buſineſs and Conſtant Employment of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Life to Travel from Place to Place, that he might he Uſeful and Beneficial to Mankind: He went to thoſe that could not, and to thoſe that would not, come to him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The People of <hi>Geneſareth</hi>'s Charity to their Sick Neighbours, they ſend abroad to let all the Country know that Chriſt the great Phyſician was come amongſt them. There is a Duty of Love and Mercy which we owe unto thoſe that are in Affliction and Miſery, <hi>namely,</hi> To afford them the beſt Help, Relief and Succour, we are able, both in their inward and outward Afflictions. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſs and Certainty of the Cure; they touched him and were made whole. The Healing Vercue lay not in their Fingers, but in their Faith; or rather in Chriſt, whom their Faith Apprehended.</p>

               <p n="1">1 THen came together unto him the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and certain of the Scribes which came from Jeruſalem. 2 And when they ſaw ſome of his diſciples eat bread with defiled (that is to ſay, with unwaſhen) hands, they found fault. 3 For the Phariſees, and all the Jews, except they waſh their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the Elders. 4 And when they come from the market, except they waſh, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <hi>as</hi> the waſhing of cups, and pots, brazen veſſels, and of tables. Then the Phariſees and Scribes asked him, Why walk not thy diſciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen hands? 6 He anſwered and ſaid unto them, Well hath Eſaias propheſied of you, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 7 Howbeit, in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 8 For laying aſide the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men; as the waſhing of pots and cups: and many other ſuch like things ye do. 9 And he ſaid unto them, Full well ye reject the Commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. 10 For Moſes ſaid, honour thy father and thy mother: and whoſo curſeth father or mother, let him die the death. 11. But ye ſay, If a man ſhall ſay to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to ſay, a gift, by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me, <hi>ſhall be free.</hi> 12 And ye ſuffer him no more to do ought for his father, or his mother: 13 Making the word of God of none effect, through your tradition, which ye have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and many ſuch like things ye do.</p>
               <p>The former part of this Chapter acquaints us with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Diſputation which our Saviour had with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees about their Superſtitious Obſervation of the Jewiſh Traditions. Theſe Traditions were ſuch Rites and Cuſtoms as were delivered to them by the Elders and Rulers of the Jewiſh Church in former times, which Traditions they Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and Regarded mere than the expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Superſtitious Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more Fond of, and Zealous for the Traditions of Men in Divine Worſhip, than of the expreſs and poſitive Commands of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is the manner of ſuch Perſons to Tye others to their own Practice and Example, in matters of Religious Worſhip; and to Cenſure and Condemn all thoſe who do not conform to them in the ſmalleſt matters. The Phariſees here Cenſure the Diſciples for eating with unwaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hands, becauſe it was their Cuſtom to waſh when they did eat; yet did not Chriſt or his Diſciples refuſe to waſh before Meat, as it was a Civil and Decent Cuſtom, but becauſe the Phariſees made it a Religious Rite: <hi>Teaching</hi> us, that what is in it ſelf indifferent, and may without offence be done as a Civil Cuſtom, ought to be Diſcountenanced and Oppoſed when required of us as an Act of Religion. The Jews fearing leſt they ſhould touch any Perſon or Thing that was unclean, and ſo be Defiled unawares, did uſe frequent waſhings, as of <hi>Cups, Pots, Veſſels, Tables, Beds,</hi> or <hi>Couches</hi> which they lay upon when they eat. Thus Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Hypocriſie puts God off with outward Cleanſing, inſtead of inward Purity; regarding more the outward Cleanneſs of the Hand, than the inward Purity of the Heart. This was the Accuſation of the Phariſees, to which our Saviour Replies by way of Recrimination, that if his Diſciples did not obſerve the Tradition of the Elders, They (the Phariſees) <hi>did reject and make void the Commandment of God, and did Worſhip him in vain, Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men. Learn hence,</hi> That all Service and Worſhip which is offered to God, according to Man's Will and Ordinances, and not according to the Rule of God's own Word, is Vain and Unprofitable: Divine Inſtitution is the only pure Rule of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as to the Subſtance of it; here what God doth not Command he forbids. <hi>Obſerve next,</hi> the Inſtance which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour produces of the Phariſees Violating an expreſs Command of God, and prefering their own Traditions before it: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the <hi>Fifth Commandment,</hi> which requires Children to Relieve their Parents in their Neceſſities. Now though the Phariſees did not deny this in plain Terms, yet they made an exception from it, which if Children pleaſed, might render it vain, void, and uſeleſs. For the Phariſees Taught, that in caſe the Child of a Poor Parent that wanted Relief, would give a Gift to the Temple, which Gift they called <hi>Corban,</hi> that is, a Gift Conſecrated to God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Uſes, that then the Children of ſuch Poor Parents were diſcharged from making any farther Proviſion for their Aged or Impotent Parents: But might reply after this manner, that which thou askeſt for thy Supply, is given to God, and therefore I cannot Relieve thee. So that Covetous and Graceleſs Children lookt upon it as the moſt frugal way, once for all, to fine to the Temple, rather than pay the conſtant Rent of Daily Relief to their Poor Parents. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Practice of Moral Duties is required before, and is more acceptable to Almighty God, than the moſt Solemn Acts and Exerciſes of Inſtituted Worſhip whatſoever. <hi>I will have Mercy,</hi> ſays God, <hi>rather than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and <hi>to do Justice and Judgment, is more acceptable to the
<pb facs="tcp:46556:59"/> Lord than Sacrifice. Secondly,</hi> That no Duty, Gift or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God is accepted, where the Duty of Charity is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; it is much more acceptable to God to refreſh the Bowels of his Saints, who are the Living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, than to Adorn Material Temples with Gold and Silver. <hi>Corban,</hi> is a <hi>Syriack</hi> Word, ſignifying a Gift given to God, The Phariſees applied theſe Gifts to the Uſe and Service of the Temple; poſſibly, to Repair, Beautifie and Adorn it; which had not been amiſs, if they had not taught, that ſuch Gifts to the Temple did diſcharge Children from the Duty of Charity to their Natural Parents. <hi>Theſe Things ought they to have done,</hi> in the firſt place, <hi>and not to leave the other undone.</hi>

               <p n="14">14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he ſaid unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and underſtand. 15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him, can defile him: but the things which come out of him, thoſe are they that defile the man. 16 If any Man have ears to hear, let him hear. 17 And when he was entered into the houſe from the people, his diſciples asked him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the parable. 18. And he ſaith unto them, Are ye ſo without underſtanding alſo? do ye not perceive, that whatſoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him, 19 Becauſe it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he ſaid, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For, from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, murders, 22 Thefts, covetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laſciviouſneſs, an evil eye, blaſphemy, pride, fooliſhneſs: 23 All theſe evil things come from within, and defile the Man.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour leaving the Phariſees with ſome diſlike, applies himſelf to the Multitude; and inſtructs them in a very neceſſary and uſeful Doctrine Touching the true Original Cauſe of all Spiritual Pollution and Uncleanneſs: <hi>Namely,</hi> The Filthineſs and Impurity of Man's Heart and Nature. And that it is not the Meat eaten with the Mouth, but the Wickedneſs of the Heart vented by the Mouth, which Pollutes a Perſon in God's Account. The Heart and Soul of Man alone is capable of Sinful Defilement. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can Defile a Perſon in God's Account, but that which defileth the inward Man. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Heart of Man is the Sink and Seed-plot of all Sin, the Source and Fountain of all Pollution. 2. That all the Impiety of the Life proceeds from the Impurity and Filthineſs of the Heart. Mens Lives would not be ſo bad if their Hearts were not worſe. Theſe Diſciples deſiring the Interpretation of the foregoing parable, our Saviour gives it them; but withal expoſtulates with them for not underſtanding a matter ſo obvious and plain, <hi>Are ye yet without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding?</hi> As if he had ſaid, have you ſat thus long under my Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Teaching, and enjoyed the Benefit of my Converſation, and yet are no further Proficients in Knowledge? Plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that Chriſt expects a Proficiency in Knowledge from us, proportionable to the Opportunities and Means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enjoyed by us. Having given them this Rebuke, he next acquaints them with the ſenſe and meaning of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; namely, That it is out of a Wicked and Sinful Heart that all Sin and Wickedneſs doth proceed. Though the Occaſions of Sin are from without, yet the Source and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of it is from within. The Heart of Man is as a Cage full of Unclean Birds; <hi>Hence proceed Evil Thoughts,</hi> either againſt God or our Neighbours. <hi>Adulteries,</hi> or all the Sins of the Fleſh. <hi>Murthers,</hi> that is, all Cruelty and hard Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards others. <hi>An Evil Eye,</hi> That is, an Envious Spirit which frets and grieves at the Happineſs of others, called an Evil Eye, becauſe Envy doth much ſhew and manifeſt it ſelf in the outward Countenance, and eſpecially by the Eyes. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> That the beſt way to hinder the progreſs of Sin in the Life, is to mortifie it in the Heart, to Crucifie all inordinate Motions, Luſts and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their root; for the Heart is the firſt Seat and Subject of Sin, from whence it flows forth into the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And from thence he aroſe and went into the borders of Tyre and Sydon, and entered into an houſe, and would have no man know it; but he could not be hid. 25 For a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe young daughter had an unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 26 (The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician, by nation) and ſhe beſought him that he would caſt forth the devil out of her Daughter. 27 But Jeſus ſaid unto her, Let the children firſt be filled: for it is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it unto the dogs. 28 And ſhe anſwered and ſaid unto him, Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbs. 29 And he ſaid unto her, for this ſaying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 30 And when ſhe was come to her houſe, ſhe found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>

               <p>This Chapter begins with the Relation of a famous Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wrought by our Saviour, <hi>Namely,</hi> His feeding of Four Thouſand Perſons with Seven Loaves and a few Fiſhes. And here we have <hi>obſervable,</hi> Firſt, The tender Care which Chriſt took of the Bodies of Men, to provide all Neceſſaries for their Support and Comfort. <hi>He giveth us Richly all things to enjoy.</hi> The great Houſe-keeper of the World <hi>openeth his Hand and filleth all things living with Plenteouſneſs.</hi> How careful was our Saviour here, that the Bodies of poor Creatures might not faint, nor be over weak and weary by the way? therefore he would not diſmiſs them without Refreſhment. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Original Source and Spring from whence this Care that Chriſt had of the Multitude, did proceed and flow. <hi>Namely,</hi> from that Sympathizing Pity and Tender Compaſſion which the merciful Heart of Chriſt did bear towards Perſons in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and Miſery. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the Tender Pity and Compaſſion of Chriſt is not the Spring and Fountain of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Mercies only, but of Temporal Bleſſings alſo. <hi>I have Compaſſion on the Multitude, who have nothing to eat. Obſ.</hi> (3.) How the Diſciples, not ſeeing any outward viſible Means for the Peoples Support, conclude it impoſſible for ſo many to be ſatisfied with the little Supply they had; Namely, Seven Loaves and a few ſmall Fiſhes. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That a weak Faith ſoon grows Thoughtful, and ſometimes Diſtruſtful at the Sight of Difficulties. <hi>Whence</hi> (ſay the Diſciples) <hi>can theſe Men be ſatisfied with Bread?</hi> Not conſidering that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in Bleſſing our Food, is far above the Means of Food. It is as eaſy for him to ſuſtain and nouriſh us with a little, as with much. <hi>Man liveth not by Bread,</hi> but by the Bleſſing of God upon the Bread he eats. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) That although Chriſt could have fed theſe Four Thouſand without the Loaves; yet he takes and makes uſe of them, ſeeing they might be had. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Chriſt did not neglect his own appointed ordinary Means; nor do any thing in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, farther than was abſolutely neceſſary. Chriſt was above Means, and could work without them, and when they failed, did ſo. But when the Means were at hand he made uſe of them himſelf, to teach us never to expect That in a way of Miracle, which may be come at in a way of Means. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) From our Lord's Example, That Religious Cuſtom of begging a Bleſſing upon our Food before we ſet down to it, and of <hi>Receiving the good Creatures of God with Thanksgiving.</hi> How unworthy is he of the Crumbs that fall from his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who with the Swine looks not up unto, and takes no thankful Notice of, the Hand that feeds him? <hi>Obſ.</hi> (6.) The Certainty and Greatneſs of the Miracle: <hi>They did all eat and were filled.</hi> They did all eat, not a Cruſt of Bread, or a bit of Fiſh, but to Satiety and Fulneſs.

'Tis hard to ſay which was the greateſt Miracle, the miraculous Eating, or miraculous Leaving.

No Sign or Miracle ſhall be wrought at their Motion and Sute: although after this, Chriſt of his own Accord, and at his own Pleaſure, wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles before their Eyes. Such as wilfully harden themſelves againſt the Light of their own Conſciences, are righteouſly delivered up to Hardneſs of Heart, and final Impenitency.

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How dull the Diſciples of Chriſt were under Chriſt's own Teaching, and how apt to put a carnal Senſe upon his Words. They apprehended he had ſpoke unto them of the Leaven of Bread, what he intended of the Leaven of the Phariſees Doctrine. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Rebuke our Saviour gives his Diſciples for not underſtanding the Senſe and Signification of what he ſpake. Chriſt is much offended with his own People, when he diſcerns Blindneſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in them after more than ordinary means of Knowledge enjoyed by them: <hi>How is it that ye do not yet underſtand? Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Metaphor by which Chriſt ſets forth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines of the Phariſees and Herodians. He compares it to <hi>Leaven.</hi> Partly for its Sowerneſs; and partly for its Diffuſiveneſs. Now <hi>the Leaven of Herod,</hi> or <hi>the Herodians,</hi> is ſuppoſed to be This: That becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> was a <hi>Jew</hi> born, and made King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and lived at the time when the Meſſiah was expected, there were thoſe that maintained the Opinion that he was the promiſed Meſſiah: which Opinion Chriſt compares to Leaven, becauſe as that diffuſeth it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole Maſs or Lump of Bread with which it is mixed: So falſe Doctrine was not only evil and corrupt in it ſelf, but apt to ſpread its Contagion farther and farther, to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of others with it. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Error is as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as Vice, and Perſons erroneous in Judgment to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as thoſe that are wicked in Converſation: and he that has a due Care of his Soul's Salvation, will be as much afraid of erroneous Principles, as he is of debauched Practices. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) Our Saviour does not command his Diſciples to ſeparate from Communion with the Phariſees, and oblige them not to hear their Doctrine; but only to beware of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which they mix with their Doctrine. We may and ought to hold Communion with a Church, though erroneous in Judgment, if not fundamentally erroneous. For Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a Church is not juſtifiable upon any other Grounds than that which makes a Separation betwixt God and that Church, which is either Apoſtacy into groſs Idolatry, or in point of Doctrine into damnable Hereſy. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) The Fault obſerved by our Saviour in his Diſciples hardneſs of Heart, <hi>Have ye your Hearts yet hardened?</hi> There may be, and oft times is, ſome degree of Hardneſs of Heart in ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but this is not a total Hardneſs, but in ſome degree only: and it is lamented, and humbled, or not indulged and delighted in. As Chriſt is grieved for the Hardneſs of his Peoples Hearts, ſo are they grieved alſo: it is both bitter and burthenſom to them.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And he cometh to Bethſaida, and they bring a blind man to him, and beſought him to touch him. 23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had ſpit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he ſaw ought. 24 And he looked up, and ſaid, I ſee men as trees, walking. 25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was reſtored, and ſaw every man clearly. 26 And he ſent him away to his houſe, ſaying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any man in the town.</p>
               <p>Here we have recorded a ſpecial Miracle wrought by our Saviour at <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> in curing a blind Man brought unto him. Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (1.) What evident Proof the Phariſees had of Chriſt's Divine Power and Godhead: He had before cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>the Deaf to hear, the Dumb to ſpeak, the Lame to walk;</hi> now <hi>he makes the Blind to ſee.</hi> Yet did the Phariſees obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſiſt all Means of their Conviction, and continued in their Oppoſition to Truth, to their inevitable and unutterable Condemnation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The wonderful Humility, the great Condeſcention of Jeſus Chriſt towards this Blind-Man: <hi>He took him by the Hand and led him,</hi> himſelf. A great Evidence of his Condeſcending Humility, and of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy; ſhewing how ready and willing he was to help and heal him; ſee here a ſingular Pattern of Humility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending Grace and Mercy in our dear Redeemer, in that he vouchſafed with his own hands to take and lead a poor Blind Man through the Streets of <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> in the ſight of all the People. <hi>Let us learn of him who was thus meek and lowly in heart. Obſ.</hi> (3.) Our Lord leads the Blind Man out of the Town before he heals him; not in the Town where all the People might take notice of it. Thereby teaching us to avoid all ſhew of Ambition, all Appearance of Vain-Glory in what we do. Even <hi>as Chriſt ſought not his own Glory, but the Glory of him that ſent him. Obſ.</hi> (4.) The manner of the Cure wrought upon this Blind Man; it was gradual and by degrees, not inſtantaneous and at once; he had firſt a dark, dim, and obſcure Sight, afterwards a clear and a perfect Sight. Chriſt thereby gave Evidence of his Abſolute and Omnipotent Power, that he was not tyed to any particular Means, or Manner, or Order of Working; but wrought his Miracles variouſly, as he ſaw to be moſt fit for the Glory of God, and the Benefit of his People. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The Charge given by our Saviour not to publiſh this Miracle in the Town of <hi>Bethſaida;</hi> a Place where Chriſt had ſo often preach'd, and wrought ſo many Miracles. But the Inhabitants had obſtinately and contemptuouſly undervalued and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both his Doctrine and Miracles; therefore we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. that our Saviour denounced a <hi>Woe againſt Bethſaida,</hi> aſſuring her, <hi>that it would be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, than for her.</hi> The higher a People riſe under the Means, the lower they fall, if they miſcarry. Such a People as have been neareſt to Converſion, being not converted, ſhall have the greateſt Condemnation when they are judged.</p>

And Peter anſwereth and ſaith unto him, Thou art the Chriſt. 30 And he charged them that they ſhould tell no man of him. 31 And he began to teach them, that the ſon of man muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief prieſts, and ſcribes, and be killed, and after three days riſe again. 32 And he ſpake that ſaying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 33 But when he had turned about, and looked on his diſciples, he rebuked Peter, ſaying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p>
               <p>Theſe Verſes relate to us a Conference which our Saviour had with his Diſciples, touching their own and others Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Perſon. Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Place where Chriſt and his Diſciples did confer; it was <hi>in the way as they walked together. Teaching</hi> us our Duty to take all Occaſions and Opportunities for Holy Conference, for good Diſcourſe touching Spiritual Things, when in the Houſe, when in the Field, when travailing in the way, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often to one another. Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Conference it ſelf: <hi>Whom do Men ſay that I am?</hi> That is, What do the common People think and ſpeak of me? not as if Chriſt were ignorant what Men ſaid of him, or did vain-gloriouſly enquire after the Opinion of the Multitude concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; but with an Intention more firmly to ſettle and eſtabliſh his Diſciples in the Belief of his being the true and promiſed Meſſias. The Diſciples tell him, That <hi>ſome ſaid, He was John the Baptiſt, others Elyas, others one of the Prophets.</hi> It is no new thing it ſeems to find Diverſity of Judgments and Opinions concerning Chriſt and the Affairs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. When our Saviour was amongſt Men who daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with him, yet was there then a great diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) How St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Mouth of all the Apoſtles, and in their Name makes a full and open Confeſſion of Chriſt, acknowledging him to be the true and promiſed Meſſiah, <hi>Peter ſaid, Thou art the Chriſt.</hi> Whence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Vail of Chriſt's Humane Nature did not keep the Eye of his Diſciples Faith from ſeeing him to be truly and really God. (2.) That Jeſus the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was the Chriſt, the true Meſſiah, or the Perſon ordained by God to be the Mediator betwixt God and Man; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Saviour of Mankind: <hi>Thou art the Chriſt. Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Charge and ſpecial Injunction given by our Saviour <hi>to tell no man of him;</hi> that is, not commonly and openly to declare that he was the Son of God and the true Meſſiah: Becauſe he was now in his State of Humiliation, and the Glory of his Divinity was to be concealed till his Reſurrection. Chriſt had his own fit Times and proper Seaſons, in which he reveal'd the great Myſteries of his Kingdom to the World. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) The great Wiſdom of our Saviour in acquainting his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with the near Approach of his Death and Paſſion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prevent that Scandal and Offence which otherwiſe they might have taken at his Sufferings: the better to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to bear that great Tryal, and to correct the Error which they had entertained touching an Earthly Kingdom of Chriſt: that the Meſſiah was to be a temporal Prince. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (6.) St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Carriage towards Chriſt upon this Occaſion. <hi>He took him aſide</hi> and began to blame him for affirming that he muſt die. Oh how ready is Fleſh and Blood to oppoſe all that tends to Suffering. What need have we to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt the Temptations of our Friends, as well as of Enemies. Satan ſometimes makes uſe of good Men as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to do his Work by, when they little ſuſpect it. Little did <hi>Peter</hi> think, that Satan now ſet him on work to hinder the Redemption of Mankind, by diſſwading Chriſt from dying. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (7.) With what Indignation Chriſt rejects <hi>Peter</hi>'s Admonition: <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> Chriſt heard Satan ſpeaking in <hi>Peter:</hi> 'Twas <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tongue, but Satan tuned it, therefore Chriſt calls <hi>Peter</hi> by Satan's Name. They that will do the Devil's Work, ſhall have the Devil's Name too. He that would hinder the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is Satan, an Adverſary to Mankind.

As well as our Saviour loved <hi>Peter,</hi> he rebukes him ſeverely. Oh Lord! ſo intent was thy Heart upon the great work of our Redemption, that thou couldſt not bear the leaſt Word that ſhould obſtruct thee in it, or divert thee from it.</p>
               <p n="34">34 And when he had called the people unto him, with his diſciples alſo, he ſaid unto them, Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me. 35 For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake and the goſpels, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How our Bleſſed Saviour recommends his Religion to every one's Election and choice, not attempting by Force and Violence to compel any Perſon to the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it. <hi>If any Man will come after me,</hi> that is, If any Man chooſes and reſolves to be a Chriſtian. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Our Saviour's Terms propounded; namely, Self-denial, Goſpel-ſuffering, and Goſpel-ſervice. (1.) Self-denial, <hi>Let him deny himſelf.</hi> By which we are not to underſtand, either the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of our Senſes in Matters of Faith, or the renouncing our Reaſon in the Matters of Religion: But a Willingneſs to part with all our Earthly Comforts and Temporal Enjoyments for the ſake of Chriſt, when called thereunto. (2.) Goſpel-ſuffering; <hi>He muſt take up his Croſs.</hi> An Alluſion to a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Cuſtom, that the Malefactor who was to be crucified, took his Croſs upon his Shoulder, and carried it to the Place of Execution. Where <hi>Note,</hi> That not the making of the Croſs, but the patient bearing of it, when God has made it and laid it upon our Shoulders, is the Duty enjoin'd: <hi>Let him take up his Croſs.</hi> (3.) Goſpel-ſervice; <hi>Let him follow me,</hi> ſays Chriſt. That is, Obey my Commands, and imitate my Example. He muſt ſet my Life and Doctrine continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and be daily correcting and reforming of his Life by that Rule and Pattern. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Reaſons urged by our Saviour to induce Men to a willingneſs to lay down their Lives for the ſake of Chriſt and his Holy Religion; <hi>He that will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it; and he that is willing to loſe his Life for the Goſpel's ſake, the ſame ſhall find it.</hi> Intimating to us, (1.) That the Love of this Temporal Life is a great Temptation to Men to deny Chriſt, and to renounce his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion. And (2.) That the ſureſt way to attain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is chearfully to lay down our Temporal Life, when the Glory of Chriſt, and the Honour of Religion requires it at our hand.</p>
               <p n="36">36 For what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? 37 Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</p>
               <p>Our Saviour had ſhewn in the former Verſes the great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſeeking to ſave our Temporal Life, by expoſing to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our Eternal Life. This he confirms in the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us by a double Argument: the firſt drawn from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Eternal Life, or the Life of the Soul The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond drawn from the Irrecoverableneſs of this Loſs; or the Impoſſibility of Redeeming the Loſs of the Soul by any way or means whatſoever. <hi>What ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul? Learn</hi> (1.) That Almighty God has intruſted every one of us with a Soul of ineſtimable Worth and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, capable of being ſaved or loſt, and that to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. (2.) That the Gain of the whole World is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable with the Loſs of one precious Soul. The Soul's Loſs is an inconceivable, incompenſable, and irrecoverable Loſs.</p>
               <p n="38">38 Whoſoever therefore ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words in this adulterous and ſinful generation; of him alſo ſhall the ſon of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his father with his holy angels.</p>
               <p>That is, whoſoever ſhall deny, or diſown me, either in my Perſon, my Goſpel, or my Members, for any Fear or Favour of Man, he ſhall with ſhame be diſowned and eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb facs="tcp:46556:61"/> by me at the great Day. There are Two Paſſions that make Perſons diſown Chriſt and Religion in the Day of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; <hi>Namely,</hi> Fear and Shame. Many good Men have been overcome by the former, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and others; but we find not any good Man in Scripture guilty of the latter; <hi>Namely,</hi> that denied Chriſt out of Shame. This argues a rotten, unſound, and corrupt Heart. If any Man thinks it beneath his Honour, and Quality to own the oppoſed Truths and deſpiſed Members of Jeſus Chriſt, he will think it much more beneath him, his Honour and Dignity, to own them at the great Day. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That it is not ſufficient that we own Chriſt by believing in him, but we muſt honour him by an outward profeſſing of him alſo. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſuch as are aſhamed of Chriſt's Doctrine or Members, are aſhamed of Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſuch as either for Fear dare not, or for Shame will not own the Doctrine of Chriſt, or the Members of Chriſt now, ſhall find Chriſt aſhamed to own and confeſs them at the Great Day. <hi>Whoſoever is aſhamed of me and of my Words, in this adulterous and wicked Generation; of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father with his Holy Angels.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 AND he ſaid unto them, verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, That there be ſome of them that ſtand here, which ſhall not taſte of death, till they have ſeen the kingdom of God come with Power.</p>
               <p>There is a three-fold Senſe and interpretation given of theſe Words by Expoſitors: (1.) Some refer the Words to the Times of the Goſpel after Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; when the Goſpel was ſpread and propagated far and near, and <hi>the Kingdom of God came with Power. Learn</hi> thence, That where the Goſpel is powerfully preached and chearfully obeyed, there Chriſt cometh moſt gloriouſly in his Kingdom. (2.) Others underſtand theſe Words of Chriſt's coming and exerciſing his Kingly Power in the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which ſome of the Apoſtles then ſtanding by lived to ſee. (3.) Others (as moſt agreeable to the Context) underſtand the Words as relating to our Saviour's Transfiguration: as if he had ſaid, <hi>Some of you,</hi> meaning <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſhall ſhortly ſee me upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> in ſuch Splendor and Glory, as ſhall be a <hi>Praeludium,</hi> a Shadow and Repreſentation of that Glory which I ſhall appear in when I come to Judge the World at the Great Day. And whereas our Saviour ſays not, there be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not die, but <hi>which ſhall not taſte of Death.</hi> This implies Two Things; (1.) That after they had ſeen this Transfiguration they muſt taſte of Death as well as others. (2.) That they ſhould but taſte of it, and no more. From whence <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That the faithful Servants and Diſciples of Chriſt muſt at length, in God's appointed Time, taſte and have experience of Death as well as others. (2.) That although they muſt taſte, yet they ſhall but taſte of Death; they ſhall not drink off the Dregs of that bitter Cup; though they fall by the hand of Death, yet ſhall they not be overcome by it; but in the very Fall get Victory over it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And after ſix days, Jeſus taketh with him Peter, James, and John; and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by themſelves: and he was transfigured before them.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Transfiguration, when he laid as it were the Garments of our frail Humanity aſide for a little time, aſſuming to himſelf the Robes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Glory, to demonſtrate and teſtify the Truth of his Divinity; for this Divine Glory was an Evidence of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; and alſo an Emblem of that Glory which he and his Diſciples, all his faithful Servants and Followers ſhall enjoy together in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And his Raiment became ſhining, exceeding white as ſnow: ſo as no Fuller on Earth can white them. 4 And there appeared unto them Elias, with Moſes, and they were talking with Jeſus. 5 And Peter anſwered and ſaid unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Maſter, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias. 6 For he wiſt not what to ſay; for they were fore afraid. 7 And there was a cloud that overſhadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is my Beloved Son; hear ye him. 8 And ſuddenly when they had looked round about, they ſaw no man any more, ſave Jeſus only with themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, Firſt, That to confirm the Diſciples Faith in the Truth of Chriſt's Divine Nature, he was pleaſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Rays of his Divinity to dart forth before their Eyes, ſo far as they were able to bear it. His Face ſhined with a pleaſing Brightneſs, and his Raiment with ſuch a glorious Luſtre, as did at once both delight and dazzle the Eyes of the Diſciples. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Choice which our Saviour makes of the Witneſſes of this his glorious Transfiguration; his Three Diſciples, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> But why Diſciples? Why Three Diſciples? Why theſe Three? (1.) Why Diſciples? Becauſe this Transfiguration was a Type and Shadow of the Glory of Heaven: Chriſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes therefore the Earneſt and Firſt-Fruits of that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only to Saints, upon whom he intended to beſtow the full Harveſt in due time. (2.) Why Three Diſciples? Becauſe Three were ſufficient to witneſs the Truth and Reality of this Miracle. Judas was unworthy of this Favour; yet leſt he ſhould murmur or be diſcontented, others are left out as well as he. But (3.) Why theſe Three, rather than others? Probably, (1.) Becauſe theſe Three were more eminent for Grace, Zeal, and Love towards Chriſt. Now the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manifeſtations of Glory are made to thoſe that are moſt excelling in Grace. (2.) Theſe Three Diſciples were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Chriſt's Agony and Paſſion; to prepare them for which, they are here made Witneſſes of his Transfiguration. This glorious Viſion upon Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> fitted them to abide the Terror of Mount <hi>Calvary. Obſ.</hi> (3.) The glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants upon our Saviour at his Transfiguration. They were <hi>Two, Two Men,</hi> and thoſe Two Men <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> This being but a Glimpſe of Chriſt's Glory, not a full Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, only Two of the glorified Saints attend at it. Theſe Two Attendants are not Two Angels, but Two Men; becauſe Men were more nearly concerned than Angels, in what was done. But why <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> rather than other Men? (1.) Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Giver of the Law; and <hi>Elias</hi> was the Chief of the Prophets. Now both theſe attending upon Chriſt, did ſhew the Conſent of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with Chriſt, and their Accompliſhment and fulfilling in him. (2.) Becauſe theſe Two were the moſt laborious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt; both adventured their Lives in God's Cauſe, and therefore are highly honoured by him. For, <hi>Thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, he will honour. Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Carriage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of the Diſciples upon this great Occaſion. (1.) They Supplicate Jeſus, not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> they make no ſuit to them, but to Chriſt only, <hi>Maſter, it is good being here.</hi> Oh! what a raviſhing Comfort and Satisfaction is the Communion and Fellowſhip of the Saints! but the Preſence of Chriſt amongſt them renders their Joys tranſporting. (2.) They proffer their Service to farther the continuance of what they did enjoy: <hi>Let us make Three Tabernacles;</hi> Saints will ſtick at no Pains or Coſt, for the Enjoyment of Chriſt's Preſence, and his Peoples Company. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That a Glimpſe of Heavens Glory is ſufficient to wrap a Soul into Extaſy, and to make it out of Love with worldly Company. (2.) That we are apt to deſire more of Heaven upon Earth than God will allow. We would have the Heavenly Glory come down to us, But are unwilling by Death to go up to That. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) How a Cloud was put before the Diſciples Eyes, when the Divine Glory was manifeſted to them: partly to allay the Luſtre and Reſplendency of that Glory which they were ſwallowed up with. The Glory of Heaven is inſupportable in this ſinful State; we cannot bear it unvail'd. And partly to hinder their farther prying and looking into that Glory. We muſt be content to behold God through a Cloud <hi>darkly here,</hi> e're long <hi>we ſhall ſee him Face to Face. Obſ.</hi> (6.) The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony given out of the Cloud by God the Father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jeſus Chriſt his Son: <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The Dignity of his Perſon; he is <hi>my Son.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:61"/> for nature co-eſſential and for time co-eternal with his Father. (2.) The Endearedneſs of his Relation he is <hi>my Beloved Son:</hi> becauſe of his conformity unto me and complyance with me, likeneſs is the cauſe of Love, and an union and harmony of wills cauſes a mutual endearing of Affections. (3.) The Authority of his Doctrine, <hi>hear ye him:</hi> not Moſes and Elias: who were Servants: but Chriſt my Son whom I have commiſſioned to be the great Prophet and Teacher of my Church: Therefore Adore him as my Son: Believe in him as your Saviour, and hear him as your Law-giver. The Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ear honours Chriſt more, then either the gazing Eye: the Adoring Knee, or the Applauding Tongue.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they ſhould tell no man what things they had ſeen: till the Son of man was riſen from the Dead. 10 And they kept that ſaying with themſelves, queſtioning what the riſing from the dead ſhould mean? 11 And they asked him ſaying, why ſay the Scribes that Elias muſt firſt come? 12 And he Anſwered and told them, Elias verily cometh firſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth all things, and how it is written of the Son of man, that he muſt Suffer many things and be ſet at naught. 13 But I ſay unto you, that Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him, whatſoever they liſted, as it is written of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here. (1.) The ſtrict Injunction given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, not to publiſh or proclaim this glorious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at his Transfiguration, till after his Reſurrection: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being now in a ſtate of Humiliation, he would have his Divine Majeſty and Glory, veil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d and concealed. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that the Divine Glory of Chriſt's perſon, as God, was not to be manifeſted ſuddenly and all at once: but gradually and by ſteps. Firſt more obſcurely by his Miracles, by the forced Acknowledgments of Devils, by the free Confeſſion of his Diſciples, and by the glorious Viſion of his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but the more clear and full, the more publick and open manifeſtation of his divine Glory was at the time of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Diſciples obedience to Chriſt's Injunction, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ching the concealing of his Transfiguration till after his Reſurrection, <hi>they kept that ſaying with themſelves, queſtioning one with another, what the riſing from the dead ſhould mean:</hi> not that they queſtioned the Reſurrection in general, but Chriſts Reſurrection only in particular, becauſe his Reſurrection did ſuppoſe his death, and they could not conceive how the Meſſiah whom they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly Suppoſed muſt be a temporal Prince, ſhould ſuffer death at the hands of men, <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Queſtion which the Diſciples put to Chriſt, how the Obſervation of the Jewiſh Doctors holds good, namely that <hi>Elias</hi> muſt come before the Meſſias come: we ſee the Meſſias, but no Elias. Our Saviour anſwers, <hi>That Elias was come already,</hi> not Elias in perſon, but <hi>one in the Spirit and Power of Elias;</hi> to wit, John the Baptiſt, who was propheſied of under the name of Elias; there being a great Reſemblance between the Elias, of the Old Teſtament, and of the new, <hi>viz. John the Baptiſt,</hi> they were both Men of a mighty Zeal, for God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they were both undaunted, reprovers of the faults of Princes, and they were both implacably hated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the ſame. Thence <hi>learn,</hi> that hatred and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even unto Death, has often been the lot and portion of ſuch Perſons who have had the courage and Zeal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the faults of Princes. <hi>Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him, whatſoever they Liſted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 And when he came to his Diſciples, he ſaw a great Multitude about them, and the Scribes queſtioning with them. 15 And ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the people when they beheld him, were greatly amazed and running to him, ſaluted him. 16 And he asked the Scribes, what queſtion ye with them. 17 And one of the multitude anſwered and ſaid, Maſter: I have brought unto thee my ſon, which hath a dumb ſpirit. 18 And whereſoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he ſometh, and gnaſheth with his Teeth, and pineth away: and I ſpake to thy Diſciples, that they ſhould caſt him out, and they could not. 19 He anſwered him, and ſaith: O faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs generation, how long ſhall I be with you? how long ſhall I ſuffer you? bring him unto me. 20 And they brought him unto him; and when he ſaw him, ſtraightway the ſpirit tare him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foming 21 And he asked his Father, How long is it ago, ſince that came unto him? And he ſaid, of a child. 22 And oft-times it hath caſt him into the fire, and into the waters to deſtroy him: but if thou canſt do any thing, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on us, and help us 23 Jeſus ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if thou canſt believe, all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, that believeth. 24 And ſtraightway the Father of the child cried out, with tears, and ſaid, Lord, I believe, help thou my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. 25 When Jeſus ſaw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul Spirit, ſaying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf ſpirit, I charge thee come out of him, and enter no more into him. 26 And the Spirit cried, and rent him ſore, and came out of him, and he was as one dead, inſomuch that many ſaid, He is dead. 27 But Jeſus took him by the hand, and lifted him up, and he aroſe. 28 And when he was come into the houſe, his Diſciples asked him privately, Why could not we caſt him out? 29 And he ſaid unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here. (1.) The perſon brought to Chriſt, for help and healing, one Bodily poſſeſt by Satan, who had made him deaf and dumb from his childhood; and oft-times caſt him into the Fire and Water, but rather to torment then to diſpatch him: Oh how does Satan, that malicious Tyrant rejoyce in doing hurt to their Bodies, as well as the ſoul of Mankind. Lord abate his power, ſince his malice will not be abated? How great is thy goodneſs in preſerving us from the power and malice of evil Spirits, and how watchful is thy Providence over us, to preſerve us, when Satan is ſeeking by all imaginable means and methods, to deſtroy us. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Perſon that repreſents his ſad condition, to our Saviour, his compaſſionate Father <hi>who kneeled down and cried out:</hi> need will make a perſon both humble and eloquent. Every one has a Tongue to ſpeak for himſelf, happy he that keeps a Tongue for others. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The circumſtance of time. Satan had got poſſeſſion of this perſon, very young, in his youth, nay, in his childhood: and oh how hard was it to caſt him out, after ſo long poſſeſſion; the Diſciples could not do it with all their power and prayers: and when our Saviour himſelf by the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head did diſpoſſeſs him, it was with foming and renting that he left him. Thus when Satan gets poſſeſſion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hearts in their youth, oh how hard will it be to caſt him out, it will put the Soul to great grief, great pain, great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart. Satan will endeavour to hold his own, and keep the ſinner his ſlave and vaſſal: if all the power of Hell can keep him. Lord! convince young perſons, that it is eaſier to keep Satan out, then it is to caſt him out of the poſſeſſion of their hearts. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Phyſicians which this diſtreſſed Perſon is brought unto. Firſt, to the Diſciples, and then to Jeſus. We never apply our ſelves importunately to the God of Power, till we diſpair of the Creatures help. But why could not the Diſciples caſt him out? Chriſt tells them becauſe of their unbelief, that is, becauſe of the weakneſs of their Faith, not the total want
<pb facs="tcp:46556:62"/> of Faith. Whence <hi>learn,</hi> that ſecret unbelief may lie hid and undiſcerned in the heart, which neither others nor our ſelves may take notice of, until ſome tryal doth diſcover it. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The poor man's humble Requeſt, and Chriſt's gracious reply. <hi>If thou canſt do any thing, help me,</hi> ſays the Father; <hi>if thou canſt believe all things are poſſible,</hi> ſays our Saviour. <hi>Note</hi> thence: that the fault is not in Chriſt, but in our ſelves if we receive not that mercy from him which we deſire and need, there is no deficiency in Chriſt's power: the defect lies in our Faith. Hereupon the man <hi>cries out with Tears, Lord, I believe help thou my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> if theſe were tears of Joy for the truth of his Faith, then we gather, that the loweſt degree and leaſt meaſure of Faith is matter of Joy unſpeakable to the owner and poſſeſſor of it. If theſe were Tears of Sorrow for the weakneſs of his Faith, then we may collect, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Unbelief in the children of God do coſt them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears: they are the burthen and ſorrow of gracious Souls. <hi>The Father of the child cried out with Tears, Lord, I believe, help my unbelief. Obſerve,</hi> (6.) With what facility and eaſe our Saviour caſt out this ſtubborn Devil that had ſo long poſſeſt this poor child, even with a word ſpeaking, how long ſoever Satan has kept poſſeſſion of a Soul. Chriſt can eject and caſt them out both eaſily and ſpeedily, one word of Chriſt's mouth is ſufficient to help us out of all diſtreſs both bodily and Spiritual. Yet did our Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the evil Spirit to rage and rend the child before he went out of him: not from any delight in the poor childs miſery, but that the Multitude ſeeing the Deſperateneſs of the Caſe, might the more admire the power of Chriſt in his Deliverance. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (7.) The Sovereign Power and abſolute Authority which Chriſt had even here on Earth, when in his State of Humiliation over the Devil and his Angels: he commands him to go out, and enter no more into the child, and is obeyed. This was a proof and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Godhead of our Saviour, that he had power and Authority over Devils, to command and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule them, to curb and reſtrain them at his Pleaſure. And whereas Chriſt commands the Devil, not only to come out, but to enter no more into the Perſon; it implies, that Satan being caſt out of his hole, earneſtly deſires to enter in again, to recover his hold, and to regain his poſſeſſion; but if Chriſt ſays enter no more; Satan ſhall obey his voyce. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (8.) The Diſciples enquiry into the Reaſons why they could not caſt this ſtubborn Devil out. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power which he had given them to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Chriſt tells them it was, (1.) Becauſe <hi>of their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> by which underſtand the weakneſs of their faith, not their total want of Faith. (2.) Becauſe they did not in this extraordinary caſe, apply themſelves to the uſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary means. <hi>Namely, prayer and faſting. Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That in extraordinary caſes, where the Neceſſities ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Soul or Body do require it, Recourſe muſt be had to the uſe of extraordinary means, one of which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Application unto God, by ſolemn Prayer. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that faſting and prayer are two ſpecial means of Chriſt's own Appointment, for the enabling of his people Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to overcome Satan and caſt him out of our ſelves or others. We muſt ſet an edge upon our Faith by prayer, and upon our Prayer by faſting.</p>
               <p n="30">30 And they departed thence, and paſſed thro' Galilee, and he would not that any man ſhould know it. 31 For he taught his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſaid unto them: The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they ſhall kill him, and after that he is killed, he ſhall riſe the third day. 32 But they underſtood not that ſaying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſervable</hi> it is, how frequently our Saviour forewarned his Diſciples of his approaching Sufferings, and as the Time of his ſuffering, grew near, he did more frequently warn them of it. But all was little enough, to arm them againſt the ſcandal of the Croſs, and to reconcile their thoughts, to a ſuffering Condition. The Diſciples had taken up the common Opinion: that the Meſſiah was to be a temporal Prince, and as ſuch to reign here upon Earth, and they knew not how to reconcile this, with his <hi>being delivered up into the hands of Men that ſhould kill him.</hi> And yet <hi>they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ask him concerning this matter.</hi> Now from Chriſt's frequent forewarning his Diſciples of approaching Sufferings we may gather, That we can never hear, either too often, or too much of the Doctrine of the Croſs, nor be too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inſtructed in our Duty, to prepare for a Suffering State. As Chriſt went by his Croſs, to his Crown, from a State of Abaſement, to a ſtate of Exaltation; ſo muſt all his Diſciples and followers likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="33">33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the houſe, he asked them, What was it, that ye diſputed among your ſelves by the way. 34 But they held their peace, for by the way, they had diſputed among themſelves: who ſhould be the greateſt? 35 And he ſat down, and called the twelve, and ſaith unto them: If any man deſire to be firſt, the ſame ſhall be laſt of all, and Servant of all. 36 And he took a child, and ſet him in the midſt of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. 37 Whoſoever ſhall receive one of ſuch children in my Name, receiveth me: and whoſoever ſhall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that ſent me.</p>
               <p>It may juſtly ſeem a wonder, that when our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour diſcourſed ſo frequently with his Diſciples, about his ſufferings, that they ſhould at the ſame time, be diſputing among themſelves, about precedency and preheminency, which of them ſhould be the greateſt, the firſt in Place, and the higheſt in Dignity and Honour. But from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we may learn, That the holieſt and beſt of men, are ſubject to Pride and Ambition. Prone to covet worldly Dignity and Greatneſs, ready to catch at the bait of Honour, to affect a precedency before, and a Superiority over others. The Apoſtles themſelves were toucht, if not tainted with the Itch of Ambition: To cure which, our Saviour preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to them the Doctrine of humility, where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Our Lord doth not ſay, he that is the firſt, but <hi>he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be firſt, ſhall be laſt of all, and Servant of all, teaching</hi> us, that all Perſons in general, and Miniſters in particular, ought not to ſeek out places of dignity and preheminency for themſelves, but be ſought out for them, he that is firſt in ſeeking them, uſually leaſt deſerves them, and laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them, <hi>if any man deſire to be firſt, the ſame ſhall be laſt of all. Obſerve</hi> (2.) Our Saviour teaches his Diſciples Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the Type and Example of a little child, which he ſets before them, as the proper Emblem of humility; ſhewing them that they ought to be as free from Ambition, as a young child, which affects nothing of precedency or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority: Such as are of higheſt Eminency in the Church of Chriſt, ought to be adorned with humility, and look upon themſelves, as lying under the greateſt Obligations, to be moſt eminently uſeful and ſerviceable, for the Churches good. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) How exceeding dear and precious ſuch perſons are to Chriſt, who reſemble little children in true humility and lowlineſs of mind, aſſuring the World, that whatſoever Kindneſs or Reſpect they ſhew to them, he accounts ſhewn to himſelf. He that receiveth them, ſays Chriſt, receiveth me, ſo near is the Union, ſo dear the Relation betwixt Chriſt and his Members, that whatever good or Evil is done to them, he Reckons it as done unto himſelf.</p>

Almighty God may and ſometimes doth give ſucceſs to ſuch Actions and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes as are good in themſelves; tho' undertaken by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have no lawful call, or warrant from God, to do them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Action of the Diſciples, towards this perſon, <hi>we forbad him.</hi> This ſhewed (1.) their Ignorance, in ſuppoſing that none could be true Diſciples, nor work Miracles, but ſuch as followed them, <hi>we forbad him, becauſe he followed not us.</hi> (2.) their Raſhneſs, in forbidding him of their own heads, before they had conſulted Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. (3.) their Envy and Emulation, in that they were grieved and diſcontented at this perſon's caſting out Devils, becauſe he was not a follower of them. Oh the imperfect Compoſition of the beſt of Saints; how much weakneſs, infirmity, and corruption doth <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Upon this Occaſion, the ſin of Envy and Emulation againſt the gifts of God in others is very natural to men, to good men, yea to the beſt of men, it is as difficult to look upon other mens Gifts without envy, as to look upon our own without pride. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) Our Saviour's anſwer and reply, <hi>forbid him not;</hi> becauſe our Saviour knew that this enterpriſe of caſting out Devils in his Name, would in ſome manner and meaſure redound to the Glory of his Name, altho' he undertook the matter without ſufficient warrant from Chriſt. We ought not to cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe who do that which is good in it ſelf, tho' they fail in the manner of it, and in the means they uſe for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.)

               <p>In the former verſe, Our Saviour diſſwaded from the Sin of Scandal, or giving offence to ſerious and ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, threatning a very grievous Judgment againſt ſuch as ſhould any ways offend them. Now in theſe ſix Verſes, he preſcribes a Remedy againſt that, and all other ſins, namely, by avoiding all occaſions that leads to Sin. Here, <hi>Obſ.</hi> (1.) The admonition or warning given by Chriſt unto us, to remove far from us all occaſions of Sin, tho' never ſo dear unto us. We are not to underſtand the Command li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, as if it were our Duty to maim our bodily Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but metaphorically, to cut off all occaſions that may betray us unto Sin. Hence <hi>Note,</hi> That ſin may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; it is our Duty to avoid whatever leads unto it, or may be the Inſtrument and Occaſion of it. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) A Reaſon enforcing the Admonition: This is drawn from the benefit and advantage that will come by cutting off ſuch occaſions of Sin. It will farther us in our attainment of eternal Life, and prevent our being caſt into Hell Fire. Now our Saviour affirms, that it is better for a Man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Life, with the loſs of all thoſe things that are dear and precious to him in this world, rather then go into Hell with the fruition and enjoyment of them. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That a diligent and daily care to avoid ſin, and all occaſions that lead unto it, will be a ſpecial means to eſcape the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, and farther us in our attainments of Heaven and Eternal Life. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Deſcription which our Saviour gives of the Torments of Hell, Firſt by its Extremity; it is like a <hi>gnawing worm</hi> and a <hi>conſuming Fire.</hi> Secondly, and by its Eternity, a worm that <hi>never dyeth,</hi> and a Fire that is <hi>never quenched. Learn</hi> hence, That there is moſt certainly a place and ſtate of puniſhment and torment in another world for wicked men to ſuffer in, upon the ſcore of Sin committed in this world. Secondly, That the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and torments of the wicked in Hell are intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and interminable of exquiſite pain and endleſs Duration. <hi>Their worm never dyeth, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi>

Secondly, Becauſe Salt has an Acrimony, a piercing power in if, which ſubdues the whole lump and turns it into its own nature.

               <p>The firſt Verſe of this Chapter, acquaints us with the great Labour and pains, our Saviour took in the exerciſe of his miniſtry, travelling from place to place, in an hot Country, and that on foot, to preach the Goſpel, when he was here upon earth: <hi>Teaching</hi> all perſons, but eſpecially Miniſters, by his Example, to be willing to undergo Pains and Labour, even unto much wearineſs, in the ſervice of God, and in the Duties of their calling. For this is God's Ordinance, that every one ſhould feel the Burthen of his calling, and the painfulneſs of it. But Lord, how nice and delicate are ſome labourers in thy Vineyard, who are willing to do nothing, but what they can do with eaſe, that cannot endure to think of labouring unto wearineſs; but are ſparing of their pains for fear of ſhortning their days, and haſting their end. Whereas the Lamp of our Lives can never be better ſpent or burnt out, then in light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to Heaven. The following verſes acquaint us, with an enſnaring queſtion, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> put to our Saviour, concerning the matter of Divorce; concluding that they ſhould entrap him in his anſwer, whatever it was, if he denied the lawfulneſs of Divorce, then they would charge him with Contradicting: <hi>Moſes</hi> who allowed it. If he affirmed it, then they would condemn him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting his own Doctrine, St. <hi>Mat. v.</hi> 32. for favouring mens luſts, and complying with the wicked cuſtom of the Jews: who upon every ſlight and frivolous occaſion put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Wives from them: But ſuch was the Wiſdom of our Saviour in all his anſwers to the enſnaring <hi>Phariſees;</hi> that neither their wit nor malice could lay hold upon any thing to entangle him in his talk. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Therefore the piety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Saviour's anſwer to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he refers them to the firſt inſtitution of marriage. When God made Husband and Wife one fleſh, to the intent, that matrimonial Love might be both incommunicable and indiſſoluble, and accordingly asks them; <hi>what did Moſes command you?</hi> thereby <hi>teaching</hi> us, that the beſt means for deciding all doubts, and reſolving all controverſies, about matters of Religion; is to have Recourſe unto the Scriptures, or the written Word of God: <hi>what did Moſes command you? Obſ.</hi> Farther, How our Saviour to confute the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the unlawfulneſs of Divorces uſed by the Jews; lays down the firſt inſtitution of Marriage, and ſhews them firſt, the Author, next the time, and then the end of the Inſtitution: the Author God. <hi>What God has joyned together,</hi> &amp;c. Marriage is an Ordinance of God's own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as the Ground and Foundation of all ſacred and civil ſociety. The time of the Inſtitution was in the beginning; Marriage is almoſt as old as the World, as old as Nature it ſelf; there was no ſooner one Perſon, but God divided him into two, and no ſooner was there two, but he united them into one. And the end of the Inſtituti- of Mariage, Chriſt declares, was this, that there might be not only an intimacy and nearneſs, but alſo an inſeparable Union and Oneneſs, by means of this endearing Relation: the congugal knot is tied ſo cloſe, that the Bonds of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial love are ſtronger then thoſe of Nature. Stricter is the Tye betwixt husband and wife, then that betwixt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and child, according to God's own appointment. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife, and they Twain ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> And whereas our Saviour adds, <hi>what God hath joyned together, let not man put aſunder;</hi> two things are hereby intimated to us. (1.) That God is the Author of the cloſe and intimate Union which is betwixt Man and Wife in a married condition. (2.) That it is not in the power of man to untie, or diſſolve that Union which God has made betwixt Man and Wife in the married eſtate, yea, it is a great ſin to adviſe unto, or endeavour after the ſeparation of them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, Our Saviour's private conference with the Diſciples, after his publick diſputation with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> about this matter of divorce. He tells his Diſciples, and in them, he tells all Chriſtians to the end of the World, that it is utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Man and Wife to be ſeparated by Divorcement, one from another, <hi>for any cauſe whatſover,</hi> except <hi>only for the ſin of Adultery</hi> committed by either of them after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that according to the Word and Will of God, nothing can violate the bonds of marriage, and juſtly a divorce betwixt Man and Wife, ſave only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing of the marriage Bed by Adultery and uncleanneſs. This is the only caſe in which Man and Wife may lawfully part, and being for this cauſe parted, whether they may afterwards marry again to other Perſons has been much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, but that the innocent and injured perſon, whether Man or Woman (for there is an equal Right on both ſides) may not marry again, ſeems very unreaſonable, for why ſhould one ſuffer for anothers fault.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here a ſolemn Action performed; Children are brought to Chriſt to be bleſt by him. Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The Perſons Brought, <hi>children,</hi> young children, ſucking Children, as the Word imports, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15. <hi>They brought them in their Arms,</hi> not led them by the Hands. (2.) The Perſon they are brought unto; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But for what End? not to Baptize them, but to bleſs them: The Parents look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt as a Prophet, a great Prophet, the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, do bring their Infants to him, that they might receive the Benefit of his Bleſſing and Prayers. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That Infants are capable of Benefit by Jeſus Chriſt. (2.) That it is the beſt Office that Parents can perform unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to bring them unto Chriſt, that they may be made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that Benefit. (3.) If Infants be capable of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Chriſt, if capable of his Bleſſing on Earth, and Preſence in Heaven; If they be Subjects of his Kingdom of Grace, and Heirs of his Kingdom of Glory, then may they be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: For they that are in Covenant, have a Right to the Seal of the Covenant. If Chriſt denies not Infants the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, which is the Greater, what Reaſon have Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to deny them the Benefit of Baptiſm, which is the Leſs.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good maſter, what ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> Here, (1.) A Perſon addreſſing himſelf to Chriſt with an important Queſtion in his Mouth: This Perſon was a young Man, a rich Man, and a Ruler; a young Man in the Prime of his Age, a rich Man in the Fulneſs of his Wealth, and a Ruler in the Prime of his Authority and Power. From whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That for young Men, rich Men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Noble Men, to enquire the way to Salvation, is very commendable, but very rare. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (2.) As the Perſon addreſſing, ſo the manner of the Addreſs, he came running and kneeled to Chriſt. Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> his Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, he <hi>came</hi> of himſelf, not drawn by others Importunity, nor drawn by his own perſonal Afflictions. And his Readineſs, he came <hi>Running:</hi> This ſhewed his Zeal and Forwardneſs to meet with Chriſt and be reſolved by him. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> His Humility, he <hi>Kneeled to him</hi> as an eminent Prophet and Teacher, not knowing him to be the Son of God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Addreſs it ſelf, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit Eternal Life?</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) He believes the Certainty of a future State. (2.) He profeſſes his Deſire of an Eternal Happineſs in that State. (3.) He declares his Readineſs to do ſome good thing, in order to the obtaining of that Happineſs. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Light of Nature, or Natural Religion, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Men that good Works are neceſſary to Salvation; or, that ſome good thing muſt be done by them, who at Death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Eternal Life. It is not talking well and profeſſing well, but doing well that entitles us to Heaven and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Why calleſt thou me good? there is none good, but one, that is God.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Why calleſt thou me good,</hi> when thou doſt not believe or own me to be God? <hi>for there is none good,</hi> that is, eſſentially and originally good, abſolutely and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably good, <hi>but God</hi> only; nor any derivatively good, but he that receiveth his Goodneſs from God alſo: There is no mere Man that is abſolutely and perfectly good of himſelf, but by Participation and Derivation from God only. See the Note on St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Thou knoweſt the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not ſteal, Do not bear falſe witneſs, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, That the Duties which our Saviour inſtances in, are the Duties of the Second Table, which Hypocrites are moſt failing in: But nothing is a better Evidence of our unfeigned Love to God, than the ſincere Performance of our Duty to our Neighbours. Love to Man is a Fruit and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Love to God; for <hi>he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> 1 John 4.20. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſuch as are defective in the Duties of the Second Table, Charity and Juſtice, do make but a counterfeit Shew of Religion, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the higheſt Meaſures and Degrees of Love to God.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And he anſwered and ſaid unto him, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, all theſe have I obſerved from my youth.</p>
               <p>This Aſſertion of the young Man might be very true, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Phariſees Senſe and Interpretation of the Law, which condemned only the groſs outward Act, not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Luſt and Motion of the Heart. An out-ſide Obedience to the Law this young Man had performed, this made him think well of himſelf, and conclude the Goodneſs of his own Condition. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, How prone Men are to think the beſt of themſelves, and to have too high an Opinion of their own Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs before God: <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my Youth:</hi> It is a natural Corruption in Men to think too well of themſelves, and of their own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs before God, but it is very dangerous and fatal ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Then Jeſus beholding him, loved him, and ſaid unto him, One thing thou lackeſt, go thy way, ſell whatſoever thou haſt and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven, and come take up the croſs and follow me. 22 And he was ſad at that ſaying, and went away grieved, for he had great poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) Chriſt's Compaſſion towards this young Man: He loved him with a Love of Pity and Compaſſion, with a Love of Courteſy and Reſpect. There may be ſome very amiable and lovely Qualities in natural and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men, and Goodneſs in what Kind or Degree ſoever it is, doth attract and draw forth Chriſt's Love towards a Perſon. If Chriſt did love Civility, what Reſpect has he for ſincere Sanctity? <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Our Lord's Admonition, <hi>One thing thou lackeſt;</hi> which was true Self-denial in renouncing the Sin of Covetouſneſs, and the inordinate Love of worldly Wealth. We ought, upon God's Call, to maintain ſuch a readineſs of Mind, as to be willing to part with all for God's ſake, which is dear unto us in this World. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) Our Lord's Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Sell what thou haſt, and give to the Poor.</hi> This was not a common but a ſpecial Precept, belonging particularly to this young Man: it was a Commandment of Tryal given to him, like that given to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. to convince him of his corrupt Confidence in his Riches: Yet is it thus far of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe to us all, to teach us, ſo to contemn worldly Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to be willing to part with them when they hinder our Happineſs and Salvation. It follows, <hi>And take up the Croſs,</hi> an Alluſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom, when the Malefactor was to be crucified he bare his Croſs upon his Shoulder, and carried it to the Place of Execution. 'Tis not the making, but the patient bearing of the Croſs which is our Duty. <hi>Learn,</hi> That all Chriſt's Followers ſhould prepare their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for Chriſt's Croſs. To bear the Croſs implies Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Integrity without ſhifting, Patience and Submiſſion without murmuring, Joy and Chearfulneſs without fainting. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Effect which our Saviour's Admonition had upon this young Perſon: <hi>He was ſad and grieved at that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Thence <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That carnal Men are ſad and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful, when they cannot win Heaven in their own way. (2.) That ſuch as are wedded to the World, will renounce Chriſt rather than the World; when the World and Chriſt ſtand in Competition.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And Jeſus looked round about and ſaith unto his diſciples, How hardly ſhall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God? 24 And the diſciples were aſtoniſhed at his words. But Jeſus anſwereth again, and ſaith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that truſt in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God? 25 It is eaſier for a camel to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 26 And they were much aſtoniſhed, ſaying with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:64"/> Who then can be ſaved? 27. But Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, With men it is impoſſible, but not with God; for with God all things are poſſible.</p>
               <p>From this Diſcourſe of our Holy Lord's concerning the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Riches, and the Difficulty that attends Rich Men in their way to Heaven, we may <hi>collect and gather, First,</hi> That Rich Men do certainly meet with more Difficulties in their Way to Heaven, than other Men. 'Tis Difficult to withdraw their Affections from Riches; to place their ſupream Love upon God in the midſt of their Abundance. 'Tis difficult to depend entirely upon God in a Rich Condition; for <hi>the Rich Man's Wealth is his ſtrong Tower. Secondly,</hi> That yet the Fault lies not in Riches, but in Rich Men, who by placing their Truſt and repoſing their Confidence in Riches, do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves uncapable of the Kingdom of God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Proverbial Speech which our Saviour makes uſe of to ſet forth the Difficulty of a Rich-Man's Salvation; <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to go through a Needle's Eye.</hi> This was a Proverb amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſignifying a thing of great Difficulty, next to an Impoſſibility, and it implies thus much: That it is not only a very great Difficulty, but an utter Impoſſibility for ſuch as abound in worldly Wealth, and place their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence therein, to be ſaved without an extraordinary Grace and Aſſiſtance from God. 'Tis hard for God to make a Rich Man happy, becauſe he thinks himſelf happy without God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Diſciples are affected with Wonder and Admiration at this Doctrine of our Saviour's, and cry out, <hi>Who then can be ſaved? Learn</hi> thence, That ſuch are the ſpecial and peculiar Difficulties which lye in the Rich Man's way to Salvation, that their getting to Heaven is matter of Wonder and Admiration to the Diſciples of Chriſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) How our Saviour reſolves this Doubt, by telling his Diſciples, That what was impoſſible with Men, was poſſible with God: implying, That it is impoſſible for any Man, Rich or Poor, by his own Natural Strength to get to Heaven. And (2.) That when we are diſcouraged with the Senſe of our own Impotency, we ſhould conſider the Power of God, and act our Faith upon it: <hi>With God all things are poſſible.</hi>

               <p n="28">28 Then Peter began to ſay unto him, Lord, we have left all and have followed thee. 29 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, there is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my ſake and the Goſpels, 30 But he ſhall receive an hundred fold, now in this time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with perſecutions, and in the world to come eternal life. 31 But many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles having heard our Saviour's Command to ſell all and give to the Poor, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Name of the reſt, tells Chriſt, That <hi>they had left all to follow him.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> How <hi>Peter</hi> magnifies that Little which he had left for Chriſt, and uſhers it in with a Note of Admiration, <hi>Lo! We have left all. Learn</hi> hence, That though it be very little that we ſuffer for Chriſt, and have to forſake upon his Account, yet are we apt to magnify and extol it, as if it were ſome great Matter; <hi>Lord, we have left All,</hi> ſays <hi>Peter; What All, Man!</hi> hadſt thou to loſe, beſides thy ragged Nets and thy tatter'd Fiſher-Boat? A great All, next to nothing at all, ſcarce worth mentioning, and yet how is it magnified; <hi>Behold, we have left all and followed thee. Obſerve</hi> next, Our Lord's kind and gracious Anſwer, that thoſe that leave all to follow him, ſhall be no Loſers by him: We may be Loſers for Chriſt, we ſhall never be Loſers by him; for whatever we part with in this World for the ſake of Chriſt, <hi>Houſes or Lands, Brethren or Siſters, we ſhall receive an hundred fold now in this Life.</hi> But how ſo? <hi>Non formalitèr, ſed eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; non in ſpecie, ſed in valore; not in Kind, but in Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency:</hi> Not an hundred Brethren, Siſters or Lands in Kind; but he ſhall enjoy that in God, which all Creatures would be to him, if they were multiplied an hundred times: And the Gifts and Graces, the Comforts and Conſolations of the Holy Spirit, ſhall be an hundred times better Portion than any thing we can part with for the ſake of Chriſt. For the Senſe of thoſe Words, <hi>The firſt ſhall be last,</hi> &amp;c. ſee the Note on <hi>Matth.</hi> 30.19.</p>
               <p n="32">32 And they were in the way, going up to Jeruſalem: and Jeſus went before them, and they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid: and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things ſhould happen unto him. 33 Saying, Behold we go up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the ſon of man ſhall be delivered to the chief prieſts, and unto the ſcribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him to the gentiles. 34 And they ſhall mock him, and ſhall ſcourge him, and ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and kill him, and the third day he ſhall riſe again.</p>
               <p>This is at leaſt the Third time that Chriſt had acquainted his Diſciples with his approaching Sufferings. The firſt time he told his Diſciples of his Death in ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our Lord's forewarning his Diſciples ſo frequently of his Death and Sufferings, was to fore-arm them with Expectation of his Sufferings, and with Preparation for their own. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, Who were the Perſons that were the inſtrumental Cauſes of our Saviour's Death, they were both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; The Son of Man ſhall be delivered to the chief Prieſts, and they ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles. Learn</hi> hence, That as both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> had a hand in the Death and Sufferings of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſo are they by Faith capable of an Intereſt in the Merit of his Death, and in the Virtue and Efficacy of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Chriſt offered up his Blood to God, on the Behalf of them that ſhed it.</p>
               <p n="35">35 And James and John the ſons of Zebedee came unto him, ſaying, Maſter, we would that thou ſhouldſt do for us, whatſoever we ſhall deſire. 36 And he ſaid unto them, What would ye that I ſhould do for you? 37 They ſaid unto him, Grant unto us, that we may ſit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory. 38 But Jeſus ſaid unto them, Ye know not what ye ask; can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptiſm that I am paptized with? 39 And they ſaid unto him, We can.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) The ambitious Suit and Requeſt of the Two Apoſtles <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> for Dignity and Superiority, <hi>Grant that we may ſit one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy Glory,</hi> or <hi>in thy Kingdom.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That by Chriſt's Kingdom and Glory they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood an Earthly Temporal Kingdom; for of that ſort the <hi>Jews</hi> did expect the Kingdom of the Meſſiah ſhould be, and the Diſciples themſelves were tainted with the common Errors. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Ambition and inordinate Deſire of worldly Honour and Dignity, is a Sin very natural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the beſt of Men: Who can wonder to ſee ſome
<pb facs="tcp:46556:64"/> Sparks of Ambition in the holieſt of God's Miniſters? when Chriſt's own Apoſtles were not free from aſpiring Thoughts, even when they lay in the Boſom of our Saviour. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Both the Unſeaſonableſs and Unreaſonableneſs of this Requeſt made by <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of his Sufferings to them, and they ſue for Dignity and great Places from him. <hi>In optimis nonnihil eſt peſſimè;</hi> The Holieſt, the Wiſeſt, and the Beſt of Men are not wholly free from paſſionate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: Who could have thought, that when our Saviour had been preaching the Doctrine of the Croſs to his Diſciples, that they ſhould at the ſame time be ſeeking and ſuing to him for Secular Dignity and Honour, Preheminence and Power? But the beſt of Men are but Men at the beſt, none are in a State of Perfection on this ſide Heaven. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) Our Saviour's Anſwer to the Diſciple's ambitious Requeſt, and the courſe which he takes to cool their Ambition; he tells them, they muſt expect here, not Crowns on their Heads, but a Croſs on their Backs, they muſt firſt taſte of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, before they partake of his Glory; and thoſe that ſuffer moſt for Chriſt, ſhall partake of the higheſt Dignity and Glory from him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The preſumptuous Confidence which the Apoſtles had of their own Strength and Ability for Sufferings, <hi>Are ye able,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>to drink of my Cup? We are able,</hi> ſay the Diſciples. Alas! poor Men! when it came to the Trial, they all cowardly forſook him and fled. Thoſe that are leaſt acquainted with Sufferings, are uſually the moſt confident Undertakers. See on <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="42">42 But Jeſus calleth them unto him, and ſaith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exerciſe lordſhip over them, and their great ones exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe authority upon them. 43 But ſo ſhall it not be amongſt you: but whoſoever will be great among you, ſhall be your miniſter. 44 And whoſoever of you will be the chiefeſt, ſhall be ſervant of all. 45 For even the ſon of man came not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</p>
               <p>To the end that our Bleſſed Saviour might effectually quench thoſe unhappy Sparks of Ambition which were kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Apoſtles Minds. He tells them, That Supremacy and Dominion belong to ſecular Princes, not to Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who ought to carry themſelves with Humility and Condeſcention one towards another. Not that Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to a Parity and Equality amongſt his Miniſters: But only condemns the Affectation of Superiority, and the Love of Preheminency. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to be ſo far from affecting a Domination and Superiority, over their Brethren, that in Imitation of their Lord and Maſter, they ought to account themſelves Fellow-Servants: <hi>The Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter. Obſ.</hi> (2.) That ſuch Miniſters as do love and affect Preheminence and Superiority, are moſt unfit for it; and they deſerve it beſt, who ſeek it leaſt. (3.) That the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Honour which the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould chiefly, yea only affect, is in another World; and the way to be greateſt and higheſt there, is to be low and humble, mean in our own Eyes, and little in our own Eſteem. See Note on <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p n="46">46 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his diſciples, and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the Son of Timeus, ſat by the high way ſide begging. 47 And when he heard that it was Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, he began to cry out, and ſay Jeſus thou ſon of David have Mercy on me. 48 And many charged him that he ſhould hold his peace, but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David have mercy on me. 49 And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſtood ſtill and commanded him to be called: and they call the blind man, ſaying unto him, Be of good comfort, riſe, he calleth thee. 50 And he caſt away his garment, roſe, and came to Jeſus. 51 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, what wilt thou that I ſhould do unto thee?

               <p>This Chapter concludes with the recital of a famous Miracle wrought by our Bleſſed Saviour upon Blind <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> in the ſight of a great Multitude which followed him. Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The Blind Man's Faith in Acknowledging Chriſt to be the Meſſiah; for ſo much the Title of the Son of <hi>David</hi> ſignified. (2.) His Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in crying ſo earneſtly to Chriſt for Mercy and Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Have Mercy upon me, thou Son of David.</hi> A true Senſe of Want will make the Soul cry unto Chriſt, with Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Importunity. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The great Compaſſion and Condeſcention of Chriſt towards this poor Blind Man, <hi>he ſtood ſtill, he called him, and enlightned his Eyes.</hi> A migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Inſtance of Chriſt's Divine Power, he that can open blind Eyes with a Touch of his Finger, is really God: His Touch is an Omnipotent Touch. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) Although Chriſt well knew the Condition of this Blind Man, yet before he will reſtore his Sight, he muſt ſenſibly complain of the want of Sight, and cry unto him for Help and Healing. Chriſt knows all his Creatures Wants, but takes no Notice of them, till they make them known to him by Prayer. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) The Way and Courſe which the Blind Man takes to expreſs his Thankfulneſs to Chriſt for recovered Sight; <hi>he aroſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Jeſus.</hi> Mercy from Chriſt is then well Improved when it engages us to follow Chriſt. This ſhould be the Effect of all Salvations wrought for us. He praiſeth God beſt, that ſerveth him moſt: The Life of Thankfulneſs, conſiſts in the Thankfulneſs of the Life.</p>

               <p>The former part of this Chapter acquaints us with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's ſolemn and triumphant riding into the City of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> He who in all his Journeys travel'd like a poor Man on Foot, without Noiſe and without Train, now he goes up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to die for Sinners, he Rides, to ſhew his great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to lay down his Life for us: The Beaſt he rides on is <hi>an Aſs,</hi> as the manner of Kings and great Perſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently was, and to fulfil that Prophecy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Tell ye the Daughter of Zion, behold, thy King cometh riding upon an Aſs.</hi> It was alſo an Aſs upon which <hi>never Man ſat before.</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that the moſt unruly and untam'd Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obſequious to Chriſt. And this was a borrow'd Aſs, whereby our Saviour's Right to all the Creatures was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: and accordingly he bids his Diſciples tell the Owner, <hi>That the Lord had need of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and Conſent: <hi>Tell him that the Lord hath need of him. Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, What a clear and full Demonſtration Chriſt gave of his Divine Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:65"/> of his Omniſciency, in fore-ſeeing and fore-telling the Event; of his Omnipotency, in inclining the Heart, and over-ruling the Will of the Owner to let the Colt go; and of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, as he was Lord of the Creatures, to command and call for their Service when he needed them.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And they brought the colt to Jeſus, and caſt their Garments on him, and he ſat upon him. 8 And many ſpread their Garments in the way, and others cut down branches of trees, and ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the way. 9 And they that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and they that followed, cryed, ſaying, Hoſanna, bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord. 10 Bleſſed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Hoſanna in the higheſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, The Obedience of the Diſciples, Firſt, they did as Jeſus commanded; they do not diſpute their Lord's commands, nor raiſe Objections, nor are afraid of dangers; when our call is clear, our Obedience muſt be ſpeedy; what Chriſt commands we are not to diſpute, but to obey. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The actions of the multitude in acknowledging Chriſt to be their King; They caſt their Garments on the ground for him to Ride upon, according to the Cuſtom of Princes, when they ride in ſtate, and do not only diſrobe their backs, but expend their Breath in joyful Acclamations and loud <hi>Hoſannah</hi>'s, wiſhing all manner of proſperity to their meek, but mighty King. In this Princely, yet poor and deſpicable pomp, doth our Saviour enter the famous City of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> Oh! How far was our holy Lord from Affecting world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatneſs and grandeur. He deſpiſed that glory which worldly hearts, fondly admire, yet becauſe he was a King he would be proclaimed ſuch, and have his Kingdom confeſt, applauded and bleſt. But that it might appear that his Kingdom was not of this World; he abandons all worldly magnificence: Oh glorious, yet homely pomp! Oh meek, but mighty Prince!</p>
               <p n="11">11 And Jeſus entred into Jeruſalem, and into the Temple, and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide was come, he went out unto Bethany, with the twelve. 12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry. 13 And ſeeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if happily he might find any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves: for the time of figs was not yet. 14 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto it, No man eat fruit of thee, hereafter for ever. And his Diſciples heard it.</p>
               <p>Some move the Queſtion here, how Chriſt came to curſe a Tree for want of that Fruit, which the ſeaſon afforded not? It is anſwered, that Naturaliſts obſerve, that the fig-tree puts forth her fruit as ſoon as her leaf, that Tree is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bearing, and whilſt one fig is ripe, another is green, and whereas it is ſaid, <hi>that the time of figs was not yet;</hi> the meaning is, that the time of in gathering of figs was not yet, but the tree having leafs ſhewed it might have fruit, accordingly Chriſt goes in expectation of its having fruit, but finding none, either ripe or green, he curſes the tree, for totally diſappointing his expectation: Beſides Chriſt was wont not only to ſpeak, but to work parables, and this Action of his was typical. An Emblem of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in general, and of every Perſon in particular that ſatisfies himſelf with a withered profeſſion, bearing leafs only but no fruit, as this fig-tree was, ſo are they, nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curſing. From whence <hi>Note,</hi> That all ſuch as content themſelves with a fruitleſs profeſſion of Religion, are in great danger of having God's blaſting added to their Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And they came to Jeruſalem, and Jeſus went into the Temple, and began to caſt out them that ſold and bought in the Temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the ſeats of them that ſold Doves. 16 And would not ſuffer that any man ſhould carry any Veſſel thro' the Temple. 17 And he taught, ſaying unto them, Is it not written, My houſe ſhall be called of all nations the houſe of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. 18 And the Scribes and chief prieſts heard it, and ſought how they might deſtroy him: for they feared him, becauſe all the people was aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine. 19 And when even was come, he went out of the city.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had our bleſſed Saviour entred <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> but his firſt walk was to the Temple, and his firſt work there was to purge and reform. All Reformation of manners muſt begin at the houſe of God. Yet obſerve our Lord's Buſineſs at the Temple was not to ruin, but reform it only. Places dedicated to publick worſhip, if prophaned and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted ought to be purged from their abuſes, not pull'd down and deſtroyed becauſe they have been abuſed. But what was the prophanation of the Temple which ſo offended our Saviour's? I anſwer, in the outward Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there was a publick mart or market kept, where were ſold Oxen, ſheep, and Doves for Sacrifice. Many of the <hi>Jews</hi> coming an hundred miles to the Temple, it was burthenſome to bring their Sacrifices ſo far with them. Wherefore the Prieſts ordered that ſheep and oxen, meal and Oyl and ſuch other Requiſites for Sacrifice, ſhould be had for money cloſe by the Altar, to the great eaſe of the offerer; nothing coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be more plauſible then this plea. But the faireſt pretences cannot bear out a ſin with God. Therefore our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in a juſt indignation whips out theſe Chap-men, caſts down their tables, and vindicates the honour and reputation of his Fathers houſe. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that there is a Reverence due to God's houſe, for the owners ſake and for the ſervice ſake. Nothing but holineſs can become the place, where God is worſhipped in the beauty of holineſs. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, the Reaſon which our Saviour gives for this Act of his, <hi>is it not written</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my houſe ſhall be called the houſe of Prayer?</hi> Where by Prayer is to be underſtood the whole worſhip and ſervice of God, of which Prayer is an eminent and principal part, that which gives Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to an houſe is certainly the chief work to be done in that houſe. Now God's houſe being called an houſe of prayer, certainly implies that Prayer, is the chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work to be performed in his houſe. Yet, take we heed that we ſet not the ordinance of God at variance, we muſt not idolize one ordinance and vilify another, but reverence them all.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And in the morning, as they paſſed by, they ſaw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. 21 And Peter called to remembrance, ſaith unto him, Maſter, behold, the fig tree which thou curſedſt, is withered away. 22 And Jeſus anſwering ſaith unto them, have faith in God. 23 For verily I ſay unto you, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſay unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou caſt into the Sea, and ſhall not doubt in his heart, but ſhall believe that thoſe things which he ſaith ſhall come to paſs, he ſhall have whatſoever he ſaith. 24 Therefore I ſay unto you, What things ſoever ye deſire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</p>
               <p>The blaſting and ſudden withering of the fig-tree at the word of Chriſt, plainly ſhewed his divine Power, and by this miraculous operation our Saviour deſigned to ſhew his Diſciples the mighty power of Faith, That is, a full perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the power of God that he is able, and of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that he is willing to grant whatever we ask according to his will, that has a tendency to his glory and our Good. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that Faith is a neceſſary and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:65"/> principal ingredient in prayer, praying without Faith is like to a man's ſhooting without bullet, it makes a noiſe but doth no execution. 2dly, That whatſoever good thing God has made the matter of his promiſe ſhall be given to good men in a way of performance, provided they pray in ſaith, <hi>whatſoever ye deſire believe that ye Receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi>

               <p n="18">18 Then come unto him the Sadduces, which ſay there is no Reſurrection, and they asked him, ſaying. 19 Maſters, Moſes wrote unto us, if a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no Children, that his brother ſhould take his wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his brother. 20 Now there were ſeven brethren; and the firſt took a wife, and dying left no ſeed. 21 And the ſecond took her and died, neither left he any ſeed, and the third likewiſe. 22 And the ſeven had her, and left no ſeed, laſt of all the woman died alſo. 23 In the Reſurrection therefore, when they ſhall riſe, whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be of them? for the ſeven had her to wife. 24 And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto them, do ye not therefore err, becauſe ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God? 25 For when they ſhall riſe from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels which are in Heaven. 26 And as touching the dead, that they riſe, have ye not read in the Book of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how in the buſh God ſpake unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and of Jacob? 27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having put the Phariſees and Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſilence in the former verſes, here he encounters the Sadduces. This Sect derived its name from one <hi>Sadock,</hi> who denied the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection of the Body, and Angels and Spirits: Here they propound a caſe to our Saviour, of a Woman who had ſeven Brethren ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to her Husbands, they demand whoſe wiſe of the ſeven this Woman ſhall be at the Reſurrection? as if they had ſaid, if there be a Reſurrection of Bodies, ſurely there will be of Relations too, and the other World, if there be ſuch a place, will be like this, in which Men will marry, as they do here, and if ſo, whoſe Wife of the ſeven ſhall this Woman be, they all having an equal claim to her? Now our Saviour for reſolving of this queſtion, firſt ſhews the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate of Men in this, and in the other World. The Children of this World, ſays our Saviour, marry and are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Marriage, but in the Reſurrection they do neither: As if Chriſt had ſaid, after Men have lived a while in this World they die, and therefore Marriage is neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſucceſſion of Mankind. But in the other World, men ſhall become immortal and live for ever, and then the reaſon of Marriage will wholly ceaſe; for when Men can die no more, there will be no need of any new ſupplies of Mankind. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Secondly, That our Saviour having got clear of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Phariſees had often put forth ſeveral queſtions mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly unto Chriſt, and now Chriſt puts forth one queſtion innocently unto them, namely, What they thought of the Meſſiah whom they expected? They reply, that he was to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> that is, a ſecular Prince deſcending from <hi>David,</hi> who ſhould deliver them from the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and reſtore them to their Civil Rights. This was the Notion they had of the Meſſiah, that he ſhould be a meer Man, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh and nothing more. Our Saviour replys, <hi>Whence is it</hi> then, <hi>that David calls the Meſſiah Lord?</hi> Pſalm 110. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand;</hi> how could he be, both <hi>David</hi>'s Lord and <hi>David</hi>'s Son? No Son being Lord to his own Father, therefore if Chriſt were <hi>David</hi> s Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, he muſt be more than Man, more then <hi>David</hi>'s Son; as Man, ſo he was <hi>David</hi>'s Son, as God-man, ſo he was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Lord. <hi>Note</hi> hence (1.) That although Chriſt was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really Man, yet he was more then a bare Man, he was Lord unto, and the Salvation of his own Fore-fathers. <hi>Note,</hi> (2.) That the only way to reconcile the Scriptures which ſpeak concerning Chriſt, is to believe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be God and Man in one Preſon; the Meſſiah as Man, was to come forth out of <hi>David</hi>'s Loyns, but as God-man, he was <hi>David</hi>'s Soveraign and Saviour: As Man, he was his Fathers Son, as God, he was Lord to his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="38">38 And he ſaid unto them in his Doctrine, beware of the Scribes, which love to go in long cloathing, and love Salutations in the market place. 39 And the chief ſeats in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and the uppermoſt rooms at feaſts. 40 Which devour widows houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers; theſe ſhall receive greater Damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, What it is that our Saviour condemns not civil Salutations in the Market place, not the chief ſeats in Synagogues, not the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts; but their fond Affecting of theſe things, and their Ambitious aſpiring after them. It was not their taking, but their loving the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts which Chriſt condemns. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (2.) How our Saviour condemns the Phariſees for their groſs Hypocriſy, in colouring over their Covetouſneſs with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, making long Prayers in the Temple and Synagogues for Widows, and thereupon perſwading them to give bountifully to <hi>Corban,</hi> that is, the common Treaſury for the Temple, ſome part of which was imployed for their maintenance; whence we learn, that it is no new thing for deſigning Hypocrites to cover the fowleſt Tranſgreſſion with the cloak of Religion. The Phariſees made long Prayers a cloak and cover for their Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="41">41 And Jeſus ſat over againſt the Treaſury, and beheld how the people caſt money into the Treaſury, and many that were rich caſt in much. 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and ſhe threw in two mites, which makes a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 43 And he called unto him his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſaith unto them, verily I ſay unto you, that this poor Widow hath caſt more in, then all they which have caſt into the Treaſury. 44. For all they did caſt in of their abundance, but ſhe of her want did caſt in all that ſhe had, even all her living.</p>
               <p>As our bleſſed Saviour ſat over againſt the Treaſury, that is, that part of the Court of the Temple, where the <hi>Corban,</hi> or Cheſts for receiving the Peoples Offerings and Gifts were ſet, he obſerved and took notice of thoſe that offered their Oblations, and ſome that were rich offered very liberally; but <hi>a certain poor Widow came and offered two Mites.</hi> Our Saviour hereupon takes occaſion to inſtruct his Diſciples in this comfortable Truth, namely, that Almighty God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the will of thoſe that give chearfully, though they cannot give largely: This poor Woman caſt in more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the inward affection of her heart, and in proportion to her eſtate, then all thoſe that were Rich and Wealthy that had caſt in before her, a mite to her, being more then a pound to them. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That the poorer, yea the pooreſt ſort of People are not exempted from good works, even they muſt exerciſe charity according to their Abilities. <hi>Learn,</hi> (2.) That in all works of pious charity which we perform, God looks at the heart, the will, and the affection of the Giver, more then at the largeneſs and liberality of the Gift; <hi>if there be a willing mind,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here, and in the following Verſes our Saviour gives his Diſciples the Signs which ſhould Fore-run the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the firſt of which was this, that <hi>there ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe falſe Chriſts, falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Seducers,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and others, under the Name and Perſon of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as; ſome affirming themſelves to be Chriſt Perſonal, or the promiſed Meſſiah, others to be Chriſt Doctrinal; affirming their Erroneous Opinions to be the Mind and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That as there will be many Seducers, before the end of the World (for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was a Type and Emblem of the World's Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and many will be ſeduced and miſled by them: So it is the Duty of Chriſt's own Diſciples to take heed, leſt they <hi>being alſo led away by the Error of the Wicked, do fall from their own ſtedfaſtneſs; Take heed,</hi> ſays Chriſt, That <hi>no man deceive you, for many will come in my Name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and will deceive many.</hi> The Second Sign of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, was <hi>Wars,</hi> and <hi>Rumours of Wars;</hi> that is Civil Broyls and inteſtin Commotion amongſt themſelves; as alſo <hi>Famine and Earth-quakes.</hi> Whence <hi>Note,</hi> That War and Fire, Earth-quakes and Famine, are Judgments and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities inflicted by God upon a ſinful People, for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſt and Goſpel-Grace. (2.)

The word of God delivered in the Scriptures, and diſpenſed in the Miniſtry thereof, hath its divers and contrary Effects upon different and contrary Subiects, from both which, yet Almighty God knows how to Raiſe his own Glory; to the Humble and Teachable the Goſpel is in <hi>Adjutorium;</hi> to the Scorners and Deſpiſers it will be in <hi>Teſtimonium;</hi> to ſome the Savour of Life unto Life, to others the Savour of Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had all along cheriſhed in themſelves a vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that the Promiſed Meſſias ſhould be a Temporal Deliverer, and ſet them at Liberty from the Power and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and accordingly our Saviour declares to his Diſciples here, that immediately before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Deſtruction, ſeveral Perſons taking the Advantage of this Expectation, would make themſelves Heads of Parties, and pretend that they were the true Meſſiah, who ſhould ſave and deliver them from their Enemies, if they would follow them, hereupon our Saviour cautions his Diſciples againſt ſuch falſe Chriſt's, and falſe Prophets, and bids them not believe them, though they did never ſo many great Signs and Wonders, and promiſed them never ſuch glorious Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances. From hence <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That the Churches great Danger is from Seducers, that come in Chriſt's Name, and pretend to Work Signs and Wonders by his Authority. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) That ſuch is the power of Seduction and Deluſion, That many in all Ages of the Church have been carried away with Seducers and Falſe Teachers. (3.) That the Elect themſelves, if leſt to themſelves, might be Seduced, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guarded by Divine Power againſt Seduction and Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they ſhall be preſerved from that fatal Miſchief; <hi>They ſhall ſeduce (if p ſſible) even the Elect.</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour goes on in Figurative Expreſſions, to ſet forth the Calamities that ſhould befal the Jewiſh Nation, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Deſtruction; <hi>The Sun ſhall be Darkened,</hi> that is, all their Glory and Excellency ſhall be Eclipſed, all their Wealth and Proſperity ſhall be laid waſte, their whole Government, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, deſtroyed; and ſuch Marks of Miſery found upon them, as never were ſeen upon a People. Thoſe that apply this to the general Judgment, underſtand the words Literally, that <hi>Sun and Moon will then</hi> have their Influences ſuſpended, that the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> will <hi>be ſent forth to gather the Elect from all quarters of the World, with the ſound of a Trumpet,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> Probably, as there was an audible ſound of a Trumpet at the giving of the Law, ſo there ſhall be the like found of a Trumpet when Chriſt ſhall Summon the World to Judgment for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of that Law. A joyful Sound will this be to the Friends of Chriſt, a doleful, dreadful Sound in the Ears of his Enemies.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Now Learn a Parable of the Fig-tree when her Branch is yet tender, and putteth forth Leaves, ye know that Summer is near. 29 So ye in like manner, when ye ſhall ſee theſe things come to paſs, know that it is nigh, even at the door. 30 Verily I ſay unto you that this Generation ſhall not paſs, till all theſe things be done. 31 Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away. 32 But of that day and hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels that are in Heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</p>
               <p>Here our Bleſſed Saviour declares two things with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Coming; (1.) The Certainty of the thing it ſelf; (2.) The Uncertainty of the Time. The Certainty of his Coming he ſets forth by the Similitude of the Fig-Tree, whoſe Beginning to Bud <hi>declares the Summer at hand.</hi> Thus our Saviour tells them, that when they ſhould ſee the fore-mentioned Signs, they might Conclude the Deſtruction of their City and Temple to be nigh at hand; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſome then Living did ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heſe Predictions Fulfilled. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Uncertainty as to the preciſe Time when this Judgment ſhould come; no Angel in Heaven, nor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon Earth could determine the Time, only the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons in the Godhead, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That all things are not Revealed to the Angels themſelves, but ſuch things only as it Concerns them to know, and the Wiſdom of God thinks fit to Reveal. (2.) That the preciſe Time of the Day of Judgment is kept by God as a Secret to himſelf; we are not to know the Hour, to the intent we may be upon our Watch every Hour; Chriſt himſelf did not know it as Man, but as GOD only.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not when the Time is. 34 For the Son of Man is as a Man taking a far Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; who left his Houſe, and gave Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Servants, and to every Man his work, and commanded the Porter to watch. 35 Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Houſe cometh; at Even, or at Midnight, or at Cock-crowing, or in the Morning. 36 Leſt coming ſuddenly, he find you ſleeping. 37 And what I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I ſay unto all, Watch.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour takes occaſion from the fore-going Doctrine of the Certainty and Suddenneſs of his coming to Judgment, to inforce the Duty of diligent and induſtrious Watchfulneſs upon all his Diſciples and Followers; that is, to
<pb facs="tcp:46556:68"/> be upon their Guard againſt all Sin, and to be in an actual readineſs for his appearance and approach. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That it is the indiſpenſable Duty, and ought to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable endeavours of every Chriſtian to ſtand upon his Guard in a prepared readineſs for Chriſt's Appearance, both for his coming to them, and for their going to him. There is a two-fold readineſs for Chriſt's coming, namely, Habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Actual; an habitual readineſs is a readineſs or the ſtate and condition; actual readineſs is the readineſs of the Perſon: When we are furniſhed with all the Graces and Vertues of a good life, when our Lamps are burning, and our Loyns girded; our Souls furniſhed with the Graces of God's Holy Spirit, and our Lives fruitful in good Works. <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, who when his Lord cometh ſhall be found thus Watching.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 AFter two days was the feaſt of the Paſs-over, and of unleavened Bread; and the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes ſought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. 2 But they ſaid, not on the feaſt-day, leſt there be an uproar of the People.</p>
               <p>This Chapter gives us a ſad and ſorrowful account of the High Prieſts Conſpiracy againſt the Life of our Bl. Saviour, in which we have <hi>Obſervable</hi> the perſons that made this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, the manner of the Conſpiracy, and the time when this Conſpiracy was made. (1.) The Perſons Conſpiring, are the <hi>chief Prieſts, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> that is, the whole Jewiſh Sanhedrim, or General Council: They lay their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious heads together, to contrive the Deſtruction of the innocent Jeſus. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That General Councils have erred, and may err fundamentally in matters of Doctrine; ſo did this General Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> conſiſting of chief Prieſts, Doctors and Elders, with the high Prieſt their Preſident, in not believing Jeſus to be the Meſſias, after all the Miracles wrought before their Eyes. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (2.) The manner of this Conſpiracy againſt our Saviour's Life, it was Clandeſtine, Secret and Subtile; they conſult <hi>how they may take him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The circumſtance of time when this Conſpiracy was mannaged, <hi>at the Feaſt of the Paſſover,</hi> it being a cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews to execute Malefactors at their Solemn Feaſts, as at the Feaſt of the Paſſover, the Feaſt of Weeks, and the Feaſt of Tabernacles; at which times, all the Jews came up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Sacrifice, and then they put Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to Death, that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> might ſee, and fear, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly this Feaſt of the Paſſover was waited for, by the Jews as a fit opportunity to put our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to Death; the only Objection was, that it might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a Tumult amongſt the People, there being ſuch a mighty concourſe at that time in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But <hi>Judas</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them a proffer, they readily comply with the motion, and reſolve to take the firſt opportunity to put our Saviour to Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And being in Bethany, in the houſe of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the leper, as he ſat at meat, there came a Woman, having an alablaſter box of Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spikenard very precious, and ſhe brake the box, and poured it on his head. 4 And there were ſome that had indignation within themſelves, and ſaid, why was this waſte of the Oyntment made? 5 For it might have been ſold for more then three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor; and they murmured againſt her. 6 And Jeſus ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Several particulars are <hi>Obſervable</hi> in this piece of Hiſtory: As firſt, the Action which this Holy Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n performed, <hi>ſhe pours a Box of precious Ointment upon our Saviour's Head as he ſat at Meat,</hi> according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries at their Feaſts. Murmuring <hi>Judas</hi> valued this Ointment at Three Hundred Pence, which makes of our Money, Nine Pounds Seven Shillings and Six Pence, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Roman</hi> Penny at ſeven pence half penny. I do not find that any of the Apoſtles were at thus much coſt and charge to put honour upon our Saviour, as this poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That where ſtrong love prevails in the heart towards Chriſt, nothing is adjudged too dear for him, neither will it ſuffer it ſelf to be out ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Happy was it for this poor Woman, that ſhe had a more righteous judge to paſs ſentence upon her Action, then murmuring <hi>Judas. Obſerve,</hi> (3.) How readily our Holy Lord vindicates this good Woman, ſhe ſays nothing for her ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, nor need ſhe, having ſo good an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: Firſt, he rebukes <hi>Judas, let her alone, why trouble ye the Woman:</hi> Next he juſtifies the Action, <hi>ſhe hath wrought a good Work,</hi> becauſe it flow'd from a principle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> her Action, <hi>ſhe did it for my Buryal.</hi> As Kings and great Perſons were wont in thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries at their Funerals to be Embalm'd with Odours and ſweet Perfumes, ſo ſays our Saviour, This Woman to declare her Faith in me, as her King and Lord, doth with this Box of Ointment, as it were before hand, Embalm my Body for its Burial. True Faith puts honour upon a Crucified, as well as Glorified Saviour: This holy Woman accounts Chriſt worthy of all honour in his Death, believing it would be a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice unto God, and the Saviour of Life unto his People. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (4.) Our Saviour doth not only juſtify and defend the Action of this holy Woman, but magnifies and extolls it, declaring that ſhe ſhould be rewarded for it with an honourable Memorial in all ages of the Church; <hi>wherever this Goſpel is preached, this ſhall be ſpoken of for a Memorial of her. Note</hi> hence, the care which Chriſt takes to have the good Deeds of his Children not buried in the duſt with them, but had in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. Though ſin cauſes men to rot above Ground, to ſtink alive, and when they are dead, leaves an Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon their Graves; yet will the Actions of the juſt ſmell ſweet and Bloſſom in the Duſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And Judas Iſcariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief Prieſts to betray him unto them. 11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promiſed to give him money. And he ſought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>

The heinous nature of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his ſin, <hi>he betrayed Jeſus.</hi> Jeſus his Maker, Jeſus his Maſter, it is no ſtrange or uncommon thing for the vileſt of ſins, and moſt horrid impi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ties to be acted by ſuch perſons as make the moſt eminent profeſſion of Holineſs and Religion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (3.) What was the occaſion that led <hi>Judas</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:46556:69"/> commiſſion of this ſin? It was his inordinate Love of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I do not find that <hi>Judas</hi> had any particular Malice, Spight, or ill Will againſt our Saviour, but a baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Spirit of Covetouſneſs poſſeſt him, and this made him ſell his Maſter. Covetouſneſs is the root-ſin, an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and inſatiable Thirſt after the world is the parent of the moſt monſtrous and unnatural ſins, for which reaſon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doubles his caution, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs,</hi> it ſhews us both the danger of the ſin, and the great care we ought to take to preſerve our ſelves from it.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And the firſt day of unleavened bread, when they killed the paſſover, his Diſciples ſaid unto him, where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that we may eat the paſſover? 13 And he ſendeth forth two of his Diſciples, and ſaid unto them, go ye into the City, and there ſhall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of Water, follow him. 14 And whereſoever he ſhall go in, ſay ye to the good man of the houſe, the Maſter ſaith, where is the Gueſs-chamber, where I ſhall eat the paſſover with my Diſciples? 15 And he will ſhew you a large upper room furniſhed and prepared, there make ready for us. 16 And his Diſciples went forth, and came into the City, and found as he had ſaid unto them: and they made ready the paſſover.</p>
               <p>The time for the Celebration of the Paſſover being now at hand, Chriſt ſends two of his Diſciples to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things neceſſary in order thereunto. And here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) An eminent proof of Chriſt's Divine Nature, in telling them all the particulars which they ſhould meet with in the City, as <hi>a Man bearing a pitcher of Water,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) How readily the heart of this Houſe-holder was diſpoſed to receive our Saviour and his Diſciples, and to accommodate them with all things needful upon this occaſion. Our Bleſſed Saviour had not a Lamb of his own, and peradventure no Money wherewith to buy one; yet he finds as excellent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation in this poor Man's Houſe, as if he had dwelt in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Ivory Palace, and had the Proviſions of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Table. When Chriſt has a Paſſover to Celebrate, he will diſpoſe the Heart to a free Reception of himſelf. The Room which Chriſt will enter into, muſt be <hi>a large Room,</hi> an <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Room,</hi> a <hi>Room furniſhed and prepared;</hi> a <hi>large Room</hi> is an enlarged Heart, enlarged with Love and Thankfulneſs; an <hi>upper Room</hi> is an Heart Exalted, not puft up with Pride, but lift up by Heavenly Mindedneſs; a <hi>Room furniſhed,</hi> is a Soul adorned with the Graces of the Holy Spirit; into ſuch an Heart, and ſuch only will Chriſt enter.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. 18 And as they ſat and did eat, Jeſus ſaid, verily I ſay unto you, one of you which eateth with me, ſhall betray me. 19 And they began to be ſorrowful, and ſay unto him, one by one, is it I? and another ſaid, is it I? 20 And he anſwered and ſaid unto them, it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the diſh. 21 The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him, but wo to that man by whom the ſon of man is betrayed: good were it for that man, if he had never been born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) The unexampled Boldneſs of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Traitor <hi>Judas,</hi> he preſumed as ſoon as he had ſold his Maſter, to ſit down at the Table with him, and eat the Paſs-over with the Diſciples; had the preſence of <hi>Judas</hi> polluted this Ordinance to any, but himſelf, doubtleſs our Saviour would never have ſuffered him to approach unto it. But hence we <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That nothing is more ordinary, then for unholy perſons to preſs in unto the holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, which they have no right (whilſt ſuch) to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of. (2.) That the preſence of ſuch perſons doth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Ordinance only to themſelves; holy perſons are not polluted by their Sins, therefore ought not to be diſcouraged from coming by their preſence there. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (2.) What a ſurprizing and aſtoniſhing word it was, which dropt from our Saviour's Mouth amongſt his Diſciples: <hi>One ſhall betray me,</hi> yea, <hi>one of you ſhall betray me.</hi> Can any Church upon Earth expect purity in all its Members, when Chriſt's own family of Twelve had a Traitor and a Devil in it? Yet tho' it was very ſad to hear of one, it was matter of joy to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there was but one. One Hypocrite in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is too much, but there is cauſe of rejoycing if there be no more. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (3.) Chriſt did not name <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſay, Thou, O perfidious <hi>Judas,</hi> art the Traitor, <hi>but one of you ſhall betray me:</hi> Doubtleſs it was to draw him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to prevent the giving him any provocation. Lord! how ſad is it for any of thy Family, who pretend friendſhip to Thee, to conſpire with thine Enemies againſt Thee? For any <hi>that eat of thy Bread, to lift up their heel againſt Thee? Obſerve,</hi> (4.) The Diſciples ſorrow upon theſe words of Chriſt, and the effect of that Sorrow. Their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was (as well it might) exceeding great: Well might innocent Diſciples be over-whelm'd with Sorrow to hear that their Maſter ſhould die, that he ſhould die by Treaſon, that the Traitor ſhould be one of themſelves. But though their Sorrow was great, yet was the effect of their Sorrow very good, it wrought in them an holy ſuſpicion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cauſed every one to ſearch himſelf, and ſay, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is it I? Learn</hi> hence, That it is poſſible for ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wickedneſs to lodge in the heart as we never ſuſpected, till Time and Temptation drew it forth: None of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſuſpected, nay, <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf never apprehended that depth of iniquity and hypocriſy which was found lodging in him. Yet <hi>Note,</hi> that though the Diſciples were jealous and ſuſpicious, yet was it of themſelves, not of one another, nay, not of <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, every one ſaid, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> not, Maſter, is it <hi>Judas?</hi> True Sincerity and Chriſtian Charity will make us more ſuſpicious of our ſelves, then of any other: it hopes the beſt of others, and fears the worſt of our ſelves. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (5.) That though <hi>Judas</hi> ſees himſelf pointed at by our Saviour, and hears the dreadful Threatnings denounced againſt him, <hi>that it had been better for him, that he had ne-never been Born,</hi> yet he is no more Blank'd, then innocence it ſelf. Reſolute Sinners run on deſperately in their Evil Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and with open Eyes ſee and meet their own Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without being either diſmayed at it, or Concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. This Shameleſs Man had the Impudence to ſay to our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> Our Saviour gives him a direct Anſwer, <hi>Thou ſayeſt it.</hi> Did not <hi>Judas</hi> (think we) Bluſh extreamly, caſt down his guilty Eyes, and let fall his drooping Head at ſo galling an intimation? Nothing leſs; we read of nothing like it. Lord!

               <p n="22">22 And as they did eat, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed, and brake it, and gave to them and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body. 23 And he took the Cup, and when he had given Thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. 24 And he ſaid unto them, This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many. 25 Verily I ſay unto you, I will drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God. 26

               <p>Immediately after the Celebration of the Paſſover, our Lord Inſtitutes his Holy Supper; in which Inſtitution we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> The Author, the Time, the Elements, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Actions. <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) The Author of this new Sacrament, <hi>Jeſus took Bread; Note</hi> thence, That to Inſtitute a Sacrament is the ſole Prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt. The Church has no Power to make new Sacraments, it is only her Duty to Celebrate thoſe which her Saviour has made. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Time of the Inſtitution, the Night before his Paſſion; <hi>The Night in which he was Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Jeſus took Bread. Learn</hi> thence, That it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary when Sufferings are approaching, to have Recourſe to the Table of the Lord, which affords both an Antidote againſt Fear, and is a Reſtaurative to our Faith. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Sacramental Elements, <hi>Bread and Wine;</hi> Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Body, and Wine the Blood of our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Miniſterial Actions, <hi>The Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bread,</hi> and the <hi>Bleſſing of the Cup;</hi> as to the Bread, <hi>Jeſus took it;</hi> that is, ſet it apart from Common Uſe, and ſeparated it for Holy Ends and Purpoſes; He <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it;</hi> that is, Prayed for a Bleſſing upon it; and <hi>Brake it,</hi> thereby ſhadowing forth his Body broken upon the Croſs; and he <hi>gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying,</hi> This broken Bread ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies my Body, ſuddenly to be broken upon the Croſs, for the Redemption and Salvation of a loſt World; <hi>Do this in Remembrance of my Death.</hi> As to the Cup; Chriſt having ſet it apart by Prayer and Thankſgiving, he Commands his Diſciples to <hi>drink all of it,</hi> and accordingly they <hi>all drink of it,</hi> ſays this Evangeliſt, and our Saviour gives his Reaſon for it, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>For this is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for Remiſſion of ſins;</hi> that is, the Wine in this Cup repreſents the ſhedding of my Blood, by which the New Covenant betwixt GOD and Man is Ratified and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. Whence we <hi>Gather,</hi> That every Communicant hath as undoubted a Right to the Cup, as to the Bread in the Lord's Supper; <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> ſays Chriſt; therefore to deny the Cup to the Common People is Sacriledge, and directly contrary to our Saviour's Inſtitution. After the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration was over, our Saviour and his Diſciples <hi>Sang an Hymn,</hi> as the Jews were wont to do at the Paſſover, the ſix Euchariſtical Pſalms, from the 113th, to the 119th <hi>Pſalm;</hi> From Chriſt's Example we gather, how ſuitable it is to ſing a <hi>Pſalm</hi> after the Celebration of the Lord's Supper; How fit is it, that God be Glorified in his Church by ſinging of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in particular when the Lord's Supper is Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; <hi>When they had Sung an Hymn, they went into the Mount of Olives.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) The Warning that our Saviour gives his Diſciples of their Forſaking of him in the time of his Sufferings; <hi>All ye ſhall be offended, becauſe of me this night. Learn,</hi> that Chriſt's deareſt Friends forſook and left him alone in the midſt of his greateſt diſtreſs and danger. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) What was the Cauſe of their Flight; it was their Fear, the weakneſs of their Faith, and the prevalency of their Fear. Oh how ſad and dangerous is it, for the beſt of Men to be left under the power of their own Fears, in the day of Temptation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Notwithſtanding our Saviour's Prediction, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preſumption of his own Strength and Standing, <hi>Though all Men forſake thee, yet-will not I. Learn</hi> thence, That Self-confidence, and a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Opinion of their own Strength, is a ſin very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the holieſt and beſt of Men. This good Man reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved honeſtly, no doubt, but too too much in his own ſtrength. Little, little did he think what a Feather he ſhould be in the Wind of Temptation, if once left to the Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of his own Fears: None are ſo near falling, as thoſe who are moſt confident of their own Standing; if ever we ſtand in the day of Tryal, 'tis the fear of falling that muſt enable us to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="32">32 And they came to a place which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Gethſemane; and he ſaith unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſit ye here, while I ſhall pray. 33 And he taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy. 34 And ſaith unto them, My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful unto Death, Tarry ye here and watch. 35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the Ground and Prayed, That if it were poſſible the Hour might paſs from him. 36 And he ſaid, Abba, Father, all things are poſſible unto thee, Take away this Cup from me; nevertheleſs, not as I will, but what thou wilt. 37 And he cometh and findeth them ſleeping; and ſaith unto Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldſt not thou watch one Hour? 38 Watch ye and pray, leſt ye enter into Temptation; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit truly is ready, but the Fleſh is weak. 39 And again he went away and prayed, and ſpake the ſame words. 40 And when he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he found them aſleep again, for their Eyes were heavy; neither wiſt they what to anſwer him. 41 And he cometh the third time, and ſaith unto them, Sleep on now and take your reſt; it is enough, the Hour is come; behold the Son of Man is Betrayed into the Hands of Sinners; Riſe up, let us go, lo he that Betrayeth me is at hand.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being now come with his Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden, he falls there into a bitter and bloody Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which he prayed with wonderful Fervency and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to his Heavenly Father; his Sufferings were now coming on a great pace; and he meets them upon his Knees, and would be found in a Praying Poſture. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Prayer is the beſt Preparative for, as well as the moſt powerful Support under the heavieſt Sufferings that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us. As to this Prayer of our Saviour in the Garden, many things are very <hi>Obſervable,</hi> as (1.) The place where he Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>the Garden.</hi> But why went Chriſt thither? not with our firſt Parents to hide himſelf there amongſt the Trees of the Garden, from the Notice and Obſervation of his Enemies; But as a Garden was the place where our Miſery began; as the firſt ſcene of humane ſin and miſery was Acted in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; ſo does our Lord chooſe a Garden as the fitteſt place for his Agony and Satisfactory pains to begin in: Again, this Garden was a place of privacy and Retirement, where our Lord might beſt attend the Offices of Devotion, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to his Paſſion: <hi>John</hi> 18.2. tells us, <hi>That Jeſus oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſorted to this Garden with his Diſciples, and that Judas well knew the place;</hi> It is evident then, that Chriſt went not into the Garden to ſhun his Sufferings, but to prepare himſelf by Prayer to meet his Enemies. (2.) <hi>Obſerve</hi> the Time when he entered into the Garden for Prayer; it was in the Evening before he Suffered; here he ſpent ſome hours in pouring forth his Soul to God: For about Mid-night, <hi>Judas</hi> with his Black Guard came and Apprehended him in a Praying Poſture. Our Lord <hi>Teaching</hi> us by his Example, that when eminent Dangers are before us, eſpecially when Death is Apprehended by us, to be very much in Prayer to
<pb facs="tcp:46556:70"/> God, and very fervent in our Wreſtlings with him. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (3.) The Matter of our Lord's Prayer, <hi>That if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Cup might paſs from him,</hi> and he might be kept from the Hour of Suffering; that his Soul might eſcape that Dreadful Wrath at which he was ſo ſore Amazed. But what! Did Chriſt then begin to Repent of his Undertaking for Sinners? Did he ſhrink and give back when it came to the pinch? No, nothing leſs; but as he had two Natures, being GOD and Man, ſo he had two diſtinct Wills, as Man he feared and ſhunned Death; as GOD man he willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it: The Divine Nature, and the Humane Spirit of Chriſt, did now Aſſault each other with diſagreeing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Again, this Prayer was not Abſolute but Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; <hi>If it be poſſible, Father, if it may be;</hi> if thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if it pleaſe thee, <hi>let this Cup paſs,</hi> if not, <hi>I will drink it.</hi> The Cup of Sufferings we ſee is a very bitter and diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cup, a Cup which Humane Nature abhors, and cannot deſire, but pray againſt; yet doth God put this Bitter Cup of Affliction into the Hands oft-times of thoſe whom he doth ſincerely Love; and when he doth do ſo, it is their Duty to drink it with Silence and Submiſſion, as here their Lord did before them; <hi>Father, let the Cup paſs, yet not my Will, but thine be done. Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Manner of our Lord's Prayer in the Garden; and here we may Remark. (1.) it was a Solitary Prayer; he went by himſelf <hi>alone,</hi> out of the Hearing of his Diſciples. The Company of our beſt and deareſt Friends is not always Seaſonable; there is a time to be Solitary, as well as to be Sociable; there are Times and Caſes when a Chriſtian would not be willing that the moſt intimate Friend he has in the World ſhould be with him, to hear what paſſes in ſecret betwixt him and his God. (2.) It was an humble Prayer, that's Evident by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures into which he caſt himſelf; ſometimes Kneeling, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lying proſtrate upon his Face; he lies in the very Duſt, and lower he cannot lye, and his Heart was as low as his Body. (3.) It was a vehement, fervent, and moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayer; ſuch was the fervour of our Lord's Spirit, that he Prayed himſelf into an Agony. Oh let us bluſh to think how unlike we are to Chriſt in Prayer, as to our praying-frame of Spirit. Lord! what deadneſs and drowſineſs, what ſtupidity and formality, what dulneſs and Lazineſs is found in our Prayers? How often do our Lips move, when our Hearts ſtand ſtill? (4.) It was a Re-iterated and Repeated Prayer; he Prayed the firſt, ſecond, and third time, <hi>for the paſſing of the Cup from him;</hi> he returns upon God over and over again, reſolving to take no Denyal. Let us not be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, though we have ſought God often for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Mercy, and yet no Anſwer has been given in unto us. Our Prayers may be anſwered, though their Anſwer for the preſent is ſuſpended. A Prayer put up in Faith, according to the Will of God, though it may be delayed, it ſhall not be loſt. Our Saviour Prayed the firſt, ſecond, and third Time, for the paſſing of the Cup, and altho' he was not heard as to Exemption from Suffering, yet he was heard as to Support under Suffering. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The Poſture the Diſciples were found in when our Lord was in this Agony, Praying to his Father, <hi>They were faſt aſleep.</hi> Good God! Could they poſſibly ſleep at ſuch a time as that was, when Chriſt's Soul was exceeding Sorrowful? Could their Eyes be thus heavy? <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the beſt of Chriſt's Diſciples may be, and oft-times are over-taken with Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; with great Infirmities, when the moſt important Duties are performing; <hi>He cometh to his Diſciples, and finds them ſleeping. Obſerve</hi> (6.) The mild and gentle Reproof which he gives the Diſciples for their ſleeping; <hi>Could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> Could you not Watch when your Maſter is in ſuch Danger? Could you not Watch with me, when I am going to deliver up my Life for you? What not one Hour? and that the parting Hour too? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reprehenſion, he Subjoyns an Exhortation, <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> and ſuper-adds a forcible Reaſon, <hi>for though the Spirit be willing, yet the fleſh is weak.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Holieſt and beſt Reſolved Chriſtians, who have willing Spirits for Chriſt and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet in regard of the Weakneſs of the Fleſh, or frailty of Humane Nature, it is their Duty to Watch and Pray, and thereby guard themſelves againſt Temptation; <hi>Watch and Pray that ye enter not into Temptation, for though the Spirit is willing, yet the fleſh is weak.</hi>

               <p>The Hour is now almoſt come, even that Hour of Sorrow which Chriſt had ſo often ſpoken of, <hi>yet a little while, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of Sinners; for while he yet ſpake, cometh Judas with a Band of Soldiers,</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him; it was the Lot and Portion of our Dear Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be Betrayed into the hands of his Mortal Enemies, by the Treachery of a falſe and diſſembling Friend. Here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) The Traitor, (2.) The Treaſon, (3.) The Manner how, (4.) The Time when this Treaſonable Deſign was Executed. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Traitor <hi>Judas.</hi> All the Evangeliſts carefully deſcribe him by his Name <hi>Judas,</hi> by his ſir-name <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> leſt he ſhould be miſtaken for <hi>Jude</hi> the Brother of <hi>James.</hi> Almighty God takes great care to preſerve the Names of his upright-hearted Servants; he is further deſcribed by his Office, <hi>One of the Twelve:</hi> The Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of his Place and Station, was an high aggravation of his Tranſgreſſion. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the greateſt Profeſſors had need be very jealous of themſelves, and ſuſpicious of their own Hearts, and look well to the Grounds and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Profeſſion, for a Profeſſion begun in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, will certainly end in Apoſtacy. <hi>Learn</hi> farther, That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are never in ſuch eminent Danger, as when they meet with Temptations exactly ſuited to their Maſter Luſts. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs was <hi>Judas</hi> his Maſter-ſin; the Love of the World made him a Slave to Satan, and the Devil lays a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before him exactly ſuited to his Temper and Inclination, and it inſtantly over-comes him. Oh pray we, that we may be kept from a ſtrong and ſuitable Temptation, a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuited to our inclination, and predominant Luſt and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Treaſon of this Traitor <hi>Judas;</hi> he led on an Armed Multitude to the place where Chriſt was, gave them a Signal to diſcover him by, and bids them lay Hands upon him, and <hi>hold him faſt.</hi> This Treaſon of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> is attended with theſe Helliſh Aggravations; He had been a Witneſs to the Miracles which our Saviour had wrought by his Divine Power; and therefore could not ſin out of Ignorance; What he did was not at the ſollicitation and perſwaſion of others, but he was a Voluntier in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the High-prieſts did not ſend to him, but he went to them, offering his Aſſiſtance: No doubt it was matter of Surprize to the Chief Prieſts, to find one of Chriſt's own Diſciples at the head of a Conſpiracy againſt him! Lord! How dangerous is it to allow our ſelves in any one ſecret or open Sin? None can ſay how far that one Sin may in time lead us. Should any have told <hi>Judas</hi> that his Love of Money, would at laſt make him ſell his Saviour, he would have ſaid with <hi>Haſael, is thy Servant a Dog that he ſhould do this thing?</hi> That Soul can never be ſafe, that Harbours one ſin within its Breaſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The manner how this Helliſh Plot was Executed, partly by Force, and partly by Fraud; by Force, in that <hi>Judas</hi> came with a Multitude, Armed with <hi>Swords and Staves;</hi> and by Fraud, <hi>giving a kiſs,</hi> and <hi>ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:70"/> Hail, Maſter;</hi> Here was Honey in the Lips, but Poyſon in the Heart. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Time when, the Place where, and the Work which our Saviour was about, when this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Deſign was Executed; he was in the Garden with his Diſciples, exhorting them to Prayer and Watchfulneſs, dropping Heavenly Advice and Counſel upon them; while he yet ſpake, <hi>Lo!

Thus did our Lord's Sufferings meet him, may ours in like manner meet us. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The Endeavours uſed by the Diſciples for their Maſter's Reſcue. <hi>One of them,</hi> (St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> ſays it was <hi>Peter) draws his Sword, and cuts off the Ear of Malchus,</hi> who probably was one of the forwardeſt to lay hands on Chriſt. But why did not St. <hi>Peter</hi> draw upon <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> rather than <hi>Malchus?</hi> becauſe, though <hi>Judas</hi> was more Faulty, yet <hi>Malchus</hi> was more forward to arreſt and carry off our Saviour: How doth a pious Breaſt ſwell with Indignation at the ſight of any open Affront offered to its Saviour. Yet though St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heart was ſincere, his hand was Raſh; good Intentions are no Warrant for irregular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and accordingly Chriſt, who accepted the Affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Action; <hi>Put up thy Sword, for they that take the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword;</hi> Chriſt will thank no Man to fight for him without a Warrant and Commiſſion from him. To reſiſt a Lawful Magiſtrate, in Chriſt's own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is raſh Zeal, and diſcountenanced by the Goſpel. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> Laſtly, The effect which our Saviour's Apprehenſion had upon the Diſciples, <hi>They all forſook him and fled;</hi> They that ſaid to Chriſt a little before, <hi>Though we ſhould dye with thee, yet will not we deny thee,</hi> do all here deſert, and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly forſake him, when it came to the Tryal. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the beſt and holieſt of men know not their own Hearts, when great Temptations and Tryals are before them, until ſuch time as they come to grapple with them. No Man knows his own ſtrength, till Temptation puts it to the proof.</p>
               <p n="51">51 And there followed him a certain young Man, having a Linnen Cloath caſt about his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Body; and the young Man laid hold on him. 52 And he left the Linnen Cloath, and fled from them naked. 53 And they led Jeſus away to the High Prieſt, and with him were aſſembled all the Chief Prieſts, and the Elders, and the Scribes. 54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the Palace of the High Prieſts, and he ſat with the Servants, and warmed himſelf at the Fire. 55 And the Chief Prieſts and all the Council ſought for Witneſs againſt Jeſus to put him to death, and found none. 56 For many bare falſe Witneſs againſt him, but their Witneſs agreed not together. 57 And there aroſe certain and bare falſe Witneſs againſt him, ſaying, 58 We heard him ſay, I will deſtroy this Temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another, made without hands. 59 But neither ſo did their Witneſs agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 60 And the High Prieſt ſtood up in the midſt, and asked Jeſus, ſaying, Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou nothing? What is it which theſe Witneſs againſt thee? 61 But he held his peace and anſwered nothing; Again the High Prieſt asked him, and ſaid unto him, Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed? 62 And Jeſus ſaid, I am, And ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the Right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven. 63 Then the High Prieſt rent his Cloaths, and ſaid, What need we any farther Witneſſes? 64 Ye have heard the Blaſphemy, What think ye? and they all condemned him to be Guilty of Death. 65 And ſome began to ſpit on him, and to cover his Face, and to buffer him, and to ſay unto him, Prophecy, and the Servants did ſtrike him with the Palms of their hands.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Examination before the High-prieſt and Council, who ſat up all Night to Arraign and Try the Holy and Innocent Jeſus, for leſt his Death ſhould look like a down-right Murther, they allow him a Mock-Tryal, and abuſe the Law, by perverting it to Injuſtice and Blood-ſhed. Accordingly falſe Witneſſes are ſuborned, who Depoſe, that they heard him ſay, <hi>he would deſtroy their Temple, and build it again in three days.</hi> It is not in the power of the greateſt Innocency, to protect the moſt Innocent and Holy Perſon from Slander and falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; yea, no Perſon is ſo innocent and good, whom falſe Witneſs may not Condemn. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) Our Lord's Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience, his Silence under all theſe wicked Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and falſe Accuſations, <hi>Jeſus held his peace, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing,</hi> v. 61. Guilt is naturally Clamorous and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, but Innocency is ſilent and careleſs of Miſ-Reports. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That to bear the Revilings, Contradictions, and falſe Accuſations of Men, with a ſilent and ſubmiſſive Spirit, is an Excellent and Chriſt-like Temper. Our Lord ſtood before his unjuſt Judge and falſe Accuſers, even as a Sheep before the Shearer, dumb and not opening his Mouth, even then when a Tryal for his Life was managed, and moſt maliciouſly and illegally againſt him, <hi>When he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he threatned not.</hi> May the ſame humble Mind, and forgiving Spirit be in us, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) That although our Saviour was ſilent and made no Reply <hi>to the falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> yet now, when the queſtion was ſolemnly put by the High-Prieſt; <hi>Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>I am.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That although we are not obliged to every inſnaring Queſtion to make Anſwer, yet are we bound faithfully to own, and freely to confeſs the Truth when ſolemnly called thereunto; when our Silence will be interpreted a Denyal of the Truth, a Diſhonour to God, a Reproach and Scandal to our Brethren; it will be a great Sin to hold our Peace; and we muſt not be ſilent, though our Confeſſion of the Truth hazards our Liberty, yea, our Life. Chriſt knew that his Anſwer would coſt him his Life, and yet he durſt not but give it, <hi>Art thou the Son of the Bleſſed, Jeſus ſaid, I am. Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Crime which the High-Prieſt pronounces our Saviour to be Guilty of, that of Blaſphemy; <hi>He hath ſpoken Blaſphemy;</hi> Hereupon the High-Prieſt rends his Cloaths, it being uſual with the Jews ſo to do, both to ſhew their Sorrow for it, and great dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of it, and indignation againſt it. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The vile Affronts, and horrid Abuſes, which the Enemies of our Saviour put upon him, they ſpit in his Face, they <hi>blind fold him,</hi> they <hi>ſmite him with their hands,</hi> and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Mockery, <hi>bid him prophecy who it was that ſmote him.</hi> Verily there is no degree of Contempt, no mark of Shame, no kind of Suffering, which we ought to decline or ſtick at for Chriſt's ſake, who hid not his Face from ſhame and ſpitting upon our Account.</p>
               <p n="66">66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high Prieſt. 67 And when ſhe ſaw Peter warming himſelf, ſhe looked upon him, and ſaid, and thou alſo waſt with Jeſus of Nazareth. 68 But he denied, ſaying, I know him not, neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand I, what thou ſayeſt; and he went out into the Porch, and the cock crew. 69 And a maid ſaw him again, and began to ſay to them that ſtood by, this is one of them. 70 And he denied it again, and a little after, they that ſtood by, ſaid again to Peter, ſurely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilean, and thy ſpeech agreeth thereto. 71 But he began to

               <p>This laſt Paragraph of the Chapter gives us an Account of the fall and riſing of <hi>Peter,</hi> of his ſin in denying Chriſt, and of his recovery by Repentance, both muſt be conſidered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. Firſt, as touching his ſin and fall, there are four particulars <hi>Obſervable</hi> relating thereunto, namely, the ſin it ſelf, the occaſion of that ſin, the reiteration and repetition of it, and the aggravating circumſtances attending it. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> (1.) The Sin it ſelf, the denial of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord, <hi>I know not the man,</hi> and this back'd with an Oath, <hi>he ſwears that he knew not the man,</hi> and at laſt wiſhes an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid imprecation upon himſelf, if he knew ſuch a man. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſlaviſh and inordinate fear of ſuffering, may draw the holieſt and beſt men to commit the vileſt and the worſt of ſins. <hi>Obſerv,</hi> (2.) The occaſions of this ſin, and they were three, (1.) His following of Chriſt <hi>afar off,</hi> to follow Chriſt is the effect of Faith, to follow him afar off, is the fruit of fear and the effect of frailty. Wo unto us when a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes, if we be far from Chriſt's preſence and aſſiſtance. (2.) His being in wicked company amongſt Chriſt's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, would we eſcape Temptations to ſin, we muſt then decline ſuch company as will allure and draw us into Sin. <hi>Peter</hi> had better have been a cold by himſelf alone, than warming himſelf at a fire which was compaſſed in with the Blaſphemies of the multitude, where his Conſcience tho' not feared was yet made hard. (3.) A preſumptuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his own ſtrength and ſtanding was another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Peter</hi>'s falling, <hi>though all men forſake thee, yet will not I;</hi> Oh, Lord! to preſume upon our ſelves is the ready way to provoke thee to leave us to our ſelves, if ever we ſtand in the day of Tryal, 'tis the fear of falling that muſt enable us to ſtand. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (3.) The reiteration and repetition of this ſin, he denies Chriſt again and again, he denies him firſt with a Lie, next with an Oath, then with a curſe: Lord! how dangerous is it, not to reſiſt the firſt beginnings of ſin; if we yield to one Temptation, <hi>Satan</hi> will aſſault us with more and ſtronger. <hi>Peter</hi> proceeded from a denial to a Lie, from a Lie, to an Oath, from an Oath, to a curſe; it is our wiſdom vigorouſly to reſiſt ſin at the beginning, for then have we moſt power and ſin has leaſt. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (4.) The aggravating circumſtances attending this ſin of <hi>Peters,</hi> and they are theſe. (1.) The Character of his Perſon, a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, an Apoſtle, a chief Apoſtle, a ſpecial Favourite, who with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had the honour to be with Chriſt at his Transfiguration upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> yet he denies Jeſus Chriſt. (2.) The Perſon whom he denies, his Maſter, his Saviour and Redeemer, he that had waſhed <hi>Peters</hi> feet, that had eat the paſſover with <hi>Peter,</hi> that had given the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet is this kind and condeſcending Saviour denied by <hi>Peter.</hi> (3.) Conſider the Perſons before whom he denies him, the chief Prieſts and Elders and their Servants, oh! how grateful was it to them to ſee one Diſciple ſell Chriſt for Money, and another deny him through fear. <hi>Conſider</hi> (4.) The time when he denied him, verily it was but a few hours after he had received the Holy Sacrament from Chriſt's own Hand; how unreaſonable then is their objection againſt coming to the Lord's Table, that ſome who go to it, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt as ſoon as they come from it. Such examples ought not to diſcourage us from coming to the Ordinance, but excite and encreaſe our watchfulneſs after we have been there, that our after deportment may be ſuitable to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of a Sacramental Table. <hi>Conſider,</hi> (5.) The ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Temptation he lay under to deny his Lord and Maſter; a Damſel only ſpeaks to him, <hi>Art thou not one of his Diſciples?</hi> had a band of armed Soldiers appeared to him and apprehended him, had he been bound and led away to the Judgment-hall, and there threatned with the Sentence of an Ignominious Death, ſome excuſe might have been made for him; but to diſown his relation to Chriſt upon a word ſpoken by a ſorry Maid that kept the door only, the ſmallneſs of the Temptation was an high Aggravation of the crime. Ah, <hi>Peter!</hi> how unlike thy ſelf wert thou at this time, not a Rock but a Reed; A pillar blown down by a Womans Breath, Oh, frail humanity whoſe ſtrength is weakneſs and infirmity. <hi>Note</hi> here, That in moſt of the Saints falls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture either the firſt Enticers to them, or the Accidental occaſions of them, were the Female Sex; witneſs beſides the firſt fall, that of <hi>Adams;</hi> the fall of <hi>Lot, Sampſon, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Solomon</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> A weak Creature may be a ſtrong Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nothing is too impotent or uſeleſs for the Devils Service. It was a great aggravation of <hi>Peters</hi> ſin, that the voice of a Maid, a Door-keeper only, ſhould be ſtronger to overcome him, then his Faith in Jeſus to ſuſtain him. But what ſhall we ſay? ſmall things are ſufficient to caſt us down, if God doth not hold us up; we ſink under any Burthen, if God ſuſtains us not, and yield to the leaſt Temptation, if he leaves us to our ſelves. A Damſel ſhall then make a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhrink, and a Door-keeper is ſufficient to drive an Apoſtle before her. This is the Account in ſhort of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall. <hi>Next</hi> follows the Relation of his Recovery and riſing again by Repentance. Here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) The ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Repentance. (2.) The means of his Repentance. (3.) The manner of it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (1.) The ſuddenneſs of his Repentance, as his ſin was ſad, ſo was his Repentance ſpeedy. Sins committed by ſurprize, and through the prevalency of a ſuddain Temptation, are much ſooner repented of then where the ſin is preſumptuous and deliberate. <hi>David</hi>'s mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and adultery were deliberate acts of Sin, in which he lay almoſt twelve Months without any Solemn Repentance for them. St. <hi>Peters</hi> denial was haſty and ſudden under a violent pang and paſſion of fear, and he takes the warning of the Cock to go forth and weep for his Tranſgreſſion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (2.) The means of his Repentance which were two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the leſs principal was the crowing of the Cock, the more principal <hi>Chriſt's looking upon</hi> Peter, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the word of Chriſt.</hi> (1.) The leſs principal means of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s riſing and recovery by Repentance, was the <hi>crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cock,</hi> as the voice of the Maid occaſioned him to ſin, ſo the voice of the Cock occaſioned him to reflect, that God who always can work without means, can when ever he pleaſe work by weak and contemptible means, and open the mouth of a Bird or a Beaſt for the converſion of a Man. But why doth our Lord make uſe of the crowing of a Cock to be the means of bringing St. <hi>Peter</hi> to Repentance? There is ever ſome myſtery in Chriſt's Inſtruments; the Cock was a Preacher to call St. <hi>Peter</hi> to Repentance, there being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Emblem between the Cock and a Preacher. The Preacher muſt have the wings of the Cock to rouze up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſecurity and to awaken others to a ſenſe of their Duty; he muſt have the watchfulneſs of the Cock to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to diſcover and forewarn Danger; he muſt have the Voice of the Cock <hi>to cry aloud and tell Iſrael of their ſins,</hi> and terrify the Roaring Lyon of Hell, and make him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: In a word, he muſt obſerve the hours of the Cock to crow at all ſeaſons of the Night, to preach in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon the glad Tidings of Salvation. Again, (2.) The more principal means of St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Recovery, was firſt <hi>Chriſts looking upon Peter;</hi> Chriſt firſt looks upon <hi>Peter,</hi> before <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> look'd either upon Chriſt, or upon himſelf. Oh! won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Love and Grace towards this poor Diſciple, when our Saviour was upon his Tryal for his Life, (a time when our thoughts would be wholly taken up about our ſelves) even then did Chriſt find leiſure to think upon <hi>Peter,</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his diſconſolate Diſciple, to turn himſelf about and give him a pittiful but piercing look, a look that melted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tears: We never begin to lament our Sins, till we are lamented firſt by our Saviour. <hi>Jeſus looked upon Peter,</hi> that was the firſt more principal means of his Recovery and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But (2.) The other means was <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the words of Chriſt, before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> Now this remembrance was an applicative and feeling remembrance, he remembered the prediction of Chriſt, and applied it ſenſibly to himſelf: <hi>Teaching</hi> us, that the efficacy of Chriſt's word, in order to a ſound Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, depends not upon the Hiſtorical Remembrance of it, but upon the cloſe application thereof to every Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (3.) The manner of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it was ſecret, <hi>he went out,</hi> it was ſincere he <hi>wept,</hi> yea, <hi>wept bitterly,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> it was laſting and abiding even all the days of his Life. (1.) His Repentance was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret he went out, <hi>verè Dolet, qui ſine Teſte Dolet;</hi> he ſought a place of Retirement, where he might mourn in ſecret. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs is moſt agreeable to an afflicted Spirit, and as St.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:71"/> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sorrow cauſed him to go forth, ſo might alſo ſhame put him upon going out. Chriſt looked upon him, but how aſhamed muſt he be to look upon Chriſt, conſidering that he ſo lately denied that he had ever ſeen him. (2) St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance was Sincere, he <hi>wept,</hi> he <hi>wept bitterly;</hi> His Grief was extraordinary, and his Tears abundant; there is ever a weeping that muſt follow ſin, ſin muſt coſt the Soul ſorrow, either here or in Hell, we muſt either now mourn a while, or lament for ever; doubtleſs with <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tears there was joined hearty Confeſſion of Sin to God, and ſmart Reflections upon himſelf, we may ſuppoſe after this manner. Lord! what have I done, I, that did once acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Maſter to be Chriſt the Lord, have ſince denied him with Oaths and Imprecations; I, that promiſed to lay down my Life for his ſake, have yet diſowned and denied him at the voice of a Damſel. Oh! what weakneſs, what wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what unfaithfulneſs was here: <hi>Oh! that my Head were Waters, and mine eyes a fountain of Tears,</hi> that I might weep all my days for the fault of this one Night. Bleſſed are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Tears of a Converted Revolter, and Happy is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miſery of a mourning Offender. (3) This holy Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was laſting and abiding, he had a very quick ſenſe, and lively remembrance of this Sin upon his Soul all his life. Eccleſiaſtical ſtory Report, that ever after when St <hi>Peter</hi> heard the crowing of a Cock, he fell upon his knees and wept: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that he was wont to riſe at Midnight, and ſpend the time in penitent Devotion, between Cock-crowing and day-light; and the Papiſts who delight to turn every thing into Superſtition, began that Practice of ſetting a Cock upon the top of Towers and Steeples, to put People in mind of this ſin of <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and of his Repentance alſo by that Signal. Laſtly, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance was attended with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Zeal and forwardneſs for the Service of Chriſt, to the and of his Life; he had a burning Love towards Chriſt, <hi>Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> and as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it he feed Chriſt's Sheep; for in the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> we read of his extraordinary Diligence to ſpread the Goſpel, and his Travels in order thereunto are computed to be 950 Miles. Have any of us fallen with <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' not with a formal abjuring, yet by a practical denying of him? Let us <hi>go forth and weep with him,</hi> let us be more vigilent and watchful for time to come; let us expreſs more extraordinary love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and zeal for Chriſt; more diligence in his Service, and more concernedneſs for his Honour and Glory. This would be an happy improvement of this Example, the Lord grant it may have that Bleſſed effect. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>The fore-going Chapter gave us an Account of <hi>Judas</hi> his Treaſon, in delivering our Saviour into the Hands of the Chief Prieſts. In this Chapter we find our Holy Lord brought by the Chief Prieſts unto <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>-Governour, in order to his Condemnation. Whence <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That it has been the old Policy of Corrupt Church Governours, to abuſe the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, in Executing their cruel and unjuſt Cenſures and Sentences, upon holy and innocent Perſons. The Chief Prieſts and Elders do not kill our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour themſelves, (for it was not Lawful for them to put any Man to Death, being themſelves under the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Government) accordingly they deliver Chriſt over to the Secular Power, and deſire <hi>Pilate</hi> the Civil Magiſtrate, to Sentence and Condemn him.</p>

What were the ſins which immediately occaſioned the death of Chriſt, they were Covetouſneſs and Envy; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs cauſed <hi>Judas</hi> to ſell him to the Chief Prieſts, and Envy cauſed the Chief Prieſts to deliver him up to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> to Crucify him; Envy is a killing and murthering Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>Envy ſlayeth the ſilly one,</hi> Job 5.2. That is, it ſlayeth the ſilly Perſon who harbours this peſtilent Luſt in his Breaſt and Boſom; being like a Fire in his Bones, continually prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Spirits; and it is alſo the occaſion of ſlaying many an holy and innocent Perſon; for who can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:46556:72"/> Envy? The Perſon Envying wiſhes the Envied out of the way, yea out of the World; and if need be, will not only wiſh it, but lend a Lift upon occaſion, towards it alſo. Witneſs the Chief Prieſts here, whoſe Envy was ſo Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and Bare-faced, that <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf takes notice of it; he knew that the Chief Prieſts had delivered him for Envy. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) How unwilling, how very unwilling <hi>Pilate</hi> was to be the Inſtrument of our Saviour's Death; One while he Expoſtulates with the Chief Prieſts, ſaying, <hi>What Evil hath he done?</hi> another while he bids them, <hi>take him, and judge him according to their Law.</hi> Nay, St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, that <hi>Pilate</hi> came forth three ſeveral times, profeſſing, <hi>That he found no fault in him, Luke</hi> 23. From hence <hi>Note,</hi> That Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites within the viſible Church may be Guilty of ſuch Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Acts of Wickedneſs, as the Conſciences of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and Pagans without the Church may Boggle at, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt. <hi>Pilate,</hi> a Pagan, abſolves Chriſt, whilſt the Hypocritical Jews, that heard his Doctrine, and ſaw his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, do Condemn him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, How <hi>Pilate</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf to be overcome with the Jews Importunity, and contrary to the Light of his own Reaſon and Judgment, delivers the holy and innocent Jeſus, firſt to be Scourged, and then Crucified; it is a vain Apology for Sin, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons pretend that they were not committed with their own Conſent, but at the Inſtigation and importunity of others; Such is the Frame and Conſtitution of Man's Soul, that none can make him either wicked or miſerable, without his own Conſent; <hi>Pilate</hi> willing to content the People, <hi>when he had ſcourged Jeſus, dilivered him to be Crucified.</hi> Here <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That as the Death of the Croſs was a <hi>Roman</hi> Puniſhment, ſo it was the manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> firſt to whip their Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and then Crucify them: Now the Manner of the <hi>Roman</hi> Scourging is ſaid to be thus: They ſtript the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Perſon, and bound him to a Poſt, two ſtrong Men firſt Scourged him with Rods of Thorns; then two others Scourged him with Whips of Cords full of Knots; and laſt of all, two more with Whips of Wire, and therewith tore off the very Fleſh and Skin from the Malefactors Back and Sides: That our Bleſſed Saviour was thus Cruelly Scourged by <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Command, ſeems to ſome not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſ. 129.3. <hi>The ploughers ploughed upon my back, and made long Furrows,</hi> which if ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prophetically of Chriſt, was Literally Fulfilled in the Day of his Scourging.

Doubtleſs to Fulfil that Prophecy <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off the Hair; That by his Stripes we might be healed;</hi> and from his Example <hi>Learn;</hi> not to think it ſtrange if we find our ſelves Scourged, with Tongue, with Hand, or with both, when we ſee our dear Redeemer bleeding, by Stripes and Scourges before our Eyes.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And the Soldiers led him away into the Hall called Pretorium; and they call together the whole Band. 17 And they cloathed him with purple, and platted a Crown of Thorns, and put it about his Head. 18 And began to Salute him; Hail, King of the Jews. 19 And they ſmote him on the Head with a Reed, and did ſpit upon him, and bowing their Knees worſhipped him. 20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the Purple from him, and put his own Cloaths on him, and led him out to Crucify him.</p>
               <p>The next part of our Saviour's Sufferings conſiſted of Cruel Mockings, he had owned himſelf to be the King of the Jews, that is, a Spiritual King in and over his Church; but the Jews expecting that the Meſſiah ſhould have appeared in the Pomp of an Earthly Prince, and finding themſelves diſappointed of their Expectation in our Saviour, they look upon him as a Deceiver and Impoſtor; and accordingly treat him as a mock-King, with all the marks of Deriſion and Scorn; for firſt, they put a Crown upon his Head, but a very ignominious and painful one, <hi>a Crown of Thorns;</hi> they place a Scepter in his hand, but that of a <hi>Reed,</hi> a <hi>Robe of Scarlet</hi> or <hi>Purple</hi> upon his Body; and then <hi>bowed their Knees unto him,</hi> as they were wont to do before their Princes, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Hail, King;</hi> Thus were all the marks of Scorn ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable put upon our Dear Redeemer: Yet what they did in Jeſt, God permitted to be done in Earneſt; for all theſe things were Signs and Marks of Sovereignty; and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God cauſed the Regal Dignity of his Son to ſhine forth even in the midſt of his greateſt Abaſement; Whence was all this Jearing and Sport? but to flout Majeſty? and why did Chriſt undergo all this ignominy, diſgrace, and ſhame? but to ſhew what was due unto us for our ſins; as alſo to give us an Example, to bear all the Scorn, Reproach, and Shame imaginable for his ſake, <hi>who for the joy that was ſet before him, deſpiſed the ſhame, as well as endured the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 And they compel one Symon a Cyreni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who paſſed by, coming out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his Croſs. 22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, the place of a Skull. 23 And they gave him to drink, Wine mingled with Myrrh, but he received it not. 24 And when they had Crucified him, they parted his Garments, caſting Lots upon them, what every Man ſhould take. 25 And it was the third Hour, and they Crucified him. 26 And the Superſcription of his Accuſation was written o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, The King of the Jews. 27 And with him they Crucify two Thieves, the one on his Right hand, the other on his Left. 28 And the Scripture was Fulfilled which ſaith, And he was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors. 29 And they that paſſed by, railed on him, wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their heads, and ſaying, Ah thou that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeſt the Temple, and buildeſt it in three days. 30 Save thy ſelf, and come down from the Croſs. 31 Likewiſe alſo the chief Prieſts mocking, ſaid among themſelves, with the Scribes, He ſaved others, himſelf he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave. 32 Let Chriſt the King of Iſrael deſcend now from the Croſs, that we may ſee and believe; and they that were Crucified with him, reviled him. 33 And when the ſixth hour was come, there was Darkneſs over the whole Land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth Hour Jeſus cryed with a loud Voice, ſaying, Eloi, Eloi, lamaſabachthani? which is, being Interpreted, My God, my God, Why haſt thou forſaken me? 35 And ſome of them that ſtood by, ſaid, when they heard it, behold he calleth Elias. 36 And one ran, and filled a Sponge of Vinegar, and put it on a Reed, and gave him to drink; ſaying, let alone, Let us ſee whether Elias will come to take him down. 37 And Jeſus cryed with a loud Voice, and gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The Sentence of Death being paſt by <hi>Pilate,</hi> who can, with dry Eyes behold the ſad Pomp of our Saviour's Bloody Execution; forth-comes the Bleſſed Jeſus out of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Gate, bearing that Croſs which ſoon after was to bear him; with his Croſs on his Shoulder he marches towards <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and when they ſee he can go no faſter, they force <hi>Symon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> not out of Compaſſion, but Indignation, to be the Porter of his Croſs. This <hi>Cyrenian being a Gentile,</hi> not a <hi>Jew,</hi> that bare our Saviour's Croſs, thereby might be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the Gentiles ſhould have a part in Chriſt, as well as the Jews, and be ſharers with them in the Benefits of
<pb facs="tcp:46556:72"/> the Croſs. At length our Holy Lord comes to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> the place of his bitter and bloody Execution; here in a publick place, with infamous Company, betwixt two Thieves, is he Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; that is, faſtned to a great Croſs of Wood, his Hands ſtretched forth abroad, and his Feet cloſed together, and both Hands and Feet faſtned with Nails; his Naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was lifted up in the open Air, hanging betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; ſignifying thereby, that the Crucified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſerved to live in neither. This ſhameful, painful and accurſed death did the holy and innocent Jeſus ſuffer and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo for ſhameleſs Sinners. Some Obſerve all the Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Length, breadth, and Depth, and Height in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Sufferings; for Length, his Paſſion was ſeveral Hours long, from Twelve to Three, expoſed all that Time, both to Hunger and Cold: The Thieves that were Crucified with him, endured only Perſonal Pains, but he underwent the Miſeries of all Mankind. As to its Breadth, his Paſſion extended over all the Powers and Parts of his Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; no part free, but his Tongue, which was at Liberty to pray for his Enemies; His ſight was tormented with the ſcornful Geſtures of thoſe <hi>who paſſed by, wagging their Heads;</hi> his Hearing grieved with the Taunts and Jears of the Prieſts and People; his Smelling offended with noyſom Savours, in the place of Skulls; his Taſte with the Gall and Vinegar given him to Drink; his Feeling was wonderfully affected by the Nails which pierced his tender Nerves, with a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Wounds: And for the Depth of his Paſſion, it was as deep as Hell it ſelf; enduring Tortures in his Soul, as well as Torments in his Body, groaning under the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Deſertion, and crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Laſtly, for the Heighth of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Sufferings were as high as Heaven; his Perſon being infinite as well as innocent, no leſs then the Son of God which adds infinite worth and value to his ſufferings.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the Inſcription wrote by <hi>Pilate</hi> over our ſuffering Saviour, <hi>This is Jeſus the King of the Jews;</hi> it was the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> when they crucified a Malefactor to publiſh the cauſe of his Death in Capital Letters, placed over the head of the Perſon. Now it is obſervable how wonderfully the wiſdom of God over-ruled the heart and pen of <hi>Pilate</hi> to draw his Title which was truly Honourable, and fix it to his Croſs: <hi>Pilate</hi> is Chriſt's Herald, and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>claims him <hi>King of the Jews. Learn</hi> hence, that the regal dignity of Chriſt was proclaimed by an Enemy, and that in a time of his greateſt Sufferings and Reproaches; <hi>Pilate</hi> without his own Knowledge did our Saviour an Eminent piece of ſervice, he did that for Chriſt which none of his own Diſciples durſt do, not that he did it deſignedly, but from the ſpecial over-ruling providence of God; no thanks to <hi>Pilate</hi> for all this, becauſe the higheſt ſervices performed to Chriſt undeſignedly ſhall neither be accepted nor reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, the ſeveral Aggravations of our Lord's Sufferings upon the Croſs. (1.) From the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he ſuffered with, <hi>two Thieves;</hi> it had been a ſufficient Diſparagement to our Bleſſed Saviour, to have been ſorted with the beſt of Men, but to be numbered with the ſcum of Mankind, is ſuch an indignity, as confounds our thoughts. This was deſigned by the Jews to diſhonour and diſgrace our Saviour the more, and to perſwade the world that he was the greateſt of Offenders, but God over ruled this alſo, for fulfilling an ancient Prophecy concerning the Meſſiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. laſt v. <hi>and he was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors.</hi> (2.) Another Aggravation of our Lord's ſufferings upon the Croſs, was the ſcorn and mocking deriſion <hi>which he</hi> met with in his dying moments, both from the common People, from the chief Prieſts, and from the Thieves that ſuffered with him. The common People <hi>reviled him, wagging their heads,</hi> the chief Prieſts, though men of Age and Gravity, yet barbarouſly mock him in his miſery, and not only ſo, but they Atheiſtically ſcoff and jear at his Faith and Affiance in God; ſaying, <hi>He truſted in God, that he would deliver him, let him deliver him if he would have him.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> That perſecutors are generally Atheiſtical Scoffers, the chief Prieſts and Elders though knowing Men, yet they Blaſpheme God: They mock at his Power and deride his Providence, which is as bad as to deny his being; ſo that from hence we may <hi>gather,</hi> that thoſe who adminiſter to God in holy things by way of Office, if they be not the beſt, they are the worſt of Men. No ſuch bitter Enemies to the power of Godlineſs as the Miniſters of Religion, who were never acquainted with the Efficacy and Power of it, upon their own hearts and lives. A third Aggravation of our Lord's ſufferings upon the Croſs was this, that the Thieves that ſuffered with him, reviled him with the reſt, that is, one of them, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> has it, or perhaps both of them might do it at firſt, which if ſo, encreaſes the wonder of the penitent Thiefs Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. From the impenitent Thiefs Reviling Chriſt we <hi>learn,</hi> That neither ſhame, nor pain will change the mind of a reſolute Sinner, but even then when he is in the ſuburbs of Hell will he Blaſpheme. <hi>They that were crucified with him reviled him;</hi> but the moſt aggravating circumſtance of all the Reſt in our Lord's Sufferings was this, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of his Father, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt when ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our ſins, was really deſerted and forſaken by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and left deſtitute of all ſenſible Conſolation; <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me? Learn</hi> farther, that under this deſertion Chriſt deſpaired not, but ſtill retained a firm perſuaſion of God's Love unto him, and experienced neceſſary ſupports from him: <hi>My God, my God,</hi> theſe are words of Affiance and Faith. Chriſt was thus forſaken for us, that we might never be forſaken by God, yet by God's forſaking of Chriſt, we are not to underſtand any abatement of Divine Love, but only a withdrawing from the humane Nature the ſenſe of his Love, and a letting out upon his Soul a deep afflicting ſenſe of his Diſpleaſure, againſt Sin: There is a Two-fold deſertion, the one total, final, and eternal by which God utterly forſakes a perſon, both as to Grace and Glory, being for ſin wholly caſt out of God's preſence, and adjudged to eternal Torments. This Chriſt was not capable of, nor could the Dignity of his perſon admit it: The other is a partial Temporary deſertion, when God for a little moment hides his face from his Children. Now this was both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Chriſt's Nature, and alſo ſuitable to his Office, who was to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for our forſaking of him, and to bring us back again to God, that we might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for ever. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, what a miraculous Evidence Chriſt gave of his God-head, inſtantly before he gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>he cryed with a loud Voice:</hi> This ſhews that he did not die according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawing on, as we expreſs it, but his Life was whole in him to the laſt, and Nature as ſtrong as it was at firſt: Other men die by degrees, and towards their end, their ſenſe of pain is much blunted, but Chriſt ſtood under the pains of death in his full ſtrength, and his Life was whole and entire in him to the very laſt moment. This was evident by the mighty out-cry he made when he gave up the Ghoſt, contrary to the ſenſe and experience of all perſons; now he that could cry with ſuch a loud voice as he did <hi>(in Articulo mortis)</hi> could have kept himſelf from dying, if he would. Hence we <hi>learn,</hi> That when Chriſt died, he rather conquered Death, then was conquered by it, he muſt voluntarily and freely lay down his life before Death could come at him.</p>
               <p n="38">38 And the vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom. 39 And when the Centurion which ſtood over againſt him, ſaw that he ſo cryed out, and gave up the Ghoſt, he ſaid, truly this man was the Son of God. 40 There were alſo women looking on afar off, among whom was Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and Mary the mother of James the leſs, and Joſes, and Salome. 41. Who alſo when he was in Galilee, followed him, and miniſtred unto him, and many other women which came up with him unto Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>Three circumſtances are here <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) A ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prodigy hapning upon the death of our Saviour, <hi>the vail of the Temple was rent in twain from top to bottom;</hi> there was a two-fold vail of the Temple, one inward, the other outward; the inward vail was an hanging which parted
<pb facs="tcp:46556:73"/> the moſt holy place from the other part of the Temple, the outward vail was the partition wall of Stone, between the Sanctuary and the outer Court By the rending of one of theſe vails, God teſtified his Wrath againſt the Jews, and that he was now about to forſake his Temple; that the Ceremonial Law was now aboliſhed by the Death of Chriſt, and that by the Blood of Jeſus we have acceſs unto God, and may enter into the Holy of Holies, the Partition-wall 'twixt Jew and Gentile being pulled down. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) What influence the Manner and Circumſtances of our Saviour's Death had upon the Centurion, and the Soldiers with him, they cry out, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this was the Son of God.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the Heathen Soldiers are ſooner convinced of the Divinity of our Saviour, then the unbelieving Jewiſh Doctors. Obſtinacy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief filled their minds with an invincible prejudice againſt Chriſt, ſo that neither the Miracles wrought by him in his Life, or at his Death, could convince them that Chriſt was any thing better than an Impoſtor and Deceiver. None are ſo blind as thoſe who through malicious obſtinacy and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate prejudice will not ſee. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Who of Chriſt's Friends were witneſs of his Death? they <hi>are the Women that followed him, and miniſtred unto him,</hi> not one of his dear Diſciples dare come near him, except St. <hi>John</hi> who ſtood by the Croſs with the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Oh! what a ſhame was this for the Apoſtles, to be abſent from a Spectacle upon which the Salvation of the whole World did depend; and what an honour was this to the Female Sex in general, and to theſe holy Women in particular, that they had the Courage to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt to his Croſs, <hi>when all his Diſciples forſook him and fled.</hi> God can make timerous and fearful Women, bold and couragious Confeſſors of his Truth, and fortify them againſt the fears of his Suffering, contrary to the natural timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Temper; theſe Women wait upon Chriſt's Croſs, when Apoſtles fligh, and durſt not come nigh it.</p>
               <p n="42">42 And now when the Even was come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the preparation; that is, the day before the Sabbath. 43 Joſeph of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea, an Honourable Counſellor, which alſo waited for the Kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus. 44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead; and calling unto him the Centurion, he asked him, whither he had been any while dead. 45 And when he knew it of the Centurion, he gave the Body to Joſeph. 46 And he brought fine Linnen, and took him down, and wrapped him in Linnen, and laid him in a Sepulchre, which was hewn out of a Rock, and rolled a ſtone unto the door of the Sepulchre. 47 And Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, and Mary the Mother of Joſes, beheld where he was laid.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances of our Lord's Funeral, and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interment in the Grave, are here Recorded by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt; ſuch a Funeral as never was ſince Graves were firſt digged. Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (1.) Our Lord's Body muſt be Begg'd before it could be Bury'd; the dead Bodies of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors being in the Power, and at the Diſpoſal of the Judge. <hi>Pilate</hi> grants it; and accordingly the dead Body is taken down, wrapped in fine Linnen, and prepared for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Perſon that beſtows this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Buryal upon our Saviour, <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> a Diſciple no doubt, though he did not make a publick and open Profeſſion; a Worthy, though a Cloſe Diſciple. Grace doth not always make a publick and open ſhew where it is; as there is much Secret Riches in the Bowels of the Earth, which no Eye ever ſaw, ſo there is much Grace in the Hearts of ſome Chriſtians, that the Eye of the World takes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Notice of. Some gracious Perſons cannot put forward and diſcover themſelves in Diſcourſe as others; and yet ſuch weak Chriſtians as the World counts them, perhaps ſhall ſtand their Ground, when ſtronger run away. We read of none of the Apoſtles at Chriſt's Funeral, fear had Chaſed them away; but <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> appears boldly; if God ſtrengthen the Weak, and leave the ſtrong to the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their own Fears, <hi>The weak ſhall be as David, and the ſtrong as Tow. Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Mourners that followed our Saviour's Hearſe; Namely, the Women which came out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and particularly the two <hi>Mary</hi>'s; a very poor train of Mourners; the Apoſtles were all ſcattered, and afraid to own their Lord and Maſter, either Dying or Dead. And as our Lord affected no Pomp nor Gallantry in his Life, ſo Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pomp had been no way ſuitable, either to the End or Manner of his Death. Humiliation was deſigned in his death, and his Buryal was the loweſt Degree of his Humiliation, and therefore might not be Pompous. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Grave or Sepulchre in which our Lord was Buryed; it was in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre hewn out of a Rock, in a new Sepulchre, in a new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre in a Garden. (1.) Our Lord was Buryed in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: As by the ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were driven out of the Garden of Pleaſure, the Earthly Paradiſe, ſo by the Sufferings of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who lay Buryed in a Garden, we may hope for Entrance into the Heavenly Paradiſe. (2.) It was in a Sepulchre hewn out of a Rock, that ſo his Enemies might have no occaſion to cavil, and ſay, that his Diſciples ſtole him away by ſecret holes, or un ſeen paſſages under Ground. (3.) It was in a new Sepulchre, <hi>in which never any Man was laid,</hi> leſt his Adverſaries ſhould ſay, it was ſome other that was Riſen, who was Buryed there before him; or that he A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the Dead by touching ſome other Corpſe. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The Manner of our Lord's Funeral, it was haſty, open, and decent; it was performed in haſte, by reaſon of the ſtreights of Time; the Sabbath was Approaching, and they lay all Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs aſide to prepare for that. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, How much it is our Duty to diſpatch our Worldly Buſineſs as early as we can, towards the End of the Week, that we may be the better prepared to Sanctify the Lord's day, if we live to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it: Hence it is that we are called upon, to <hi>Remember</hi> that day before it comes, and to Sanctify it when it is come. Again, our Lord was Buryed openly, as well as haſtily, all Perſons had Liberty to be Spectators, leſt any ſhould object, that there was deceit and fraud uſed in or about our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Buryal; yet was he alſo Interr'd Decently, his Holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being wrapped in fine Linnen, and perfumed with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to the Jewiſh Cuſtom. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (6.) The Reaſons why our Lord was Buryed, ſeeing he was to Riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in as ſhort a time as other Men lye by the Walls; and had his dead Body remained a Thouſand Years un-buryed, it could have ſeen no Corruption, having never been tainted with ſin, ſin is the Cauſe of the Bodies Corruption: 'tis ſin that makes our Bodies ſtink worſe than Carrion when they are dead. A Funeral then was not neceſſary for Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, upon the ſame Accounts that it is neceſſary for ours. But (1.) Our Lord was Buryed to declare the certainty of his Death, and the Reality of his Reſurrection, and for this Reaſon did God's Providence Order it, that he ſhould be Embalmed to cut off all Pretenſions; for in this kind of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming, his Mouth, his Ears, and his Noſtrils, were all filled with Odours and Spices, ſo that there could be no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent principle of Life in him; he being thus Buryed then, did demonſtrate him to be certainly Dead. (2.) Chriſt was Buryed to fulfil the Types and Prophecies that went before concerning him, <hi>Jonas being three days and three nights in the Belly of the Whale,</hi> was a Type <hi>of Chriſt's being three days and three nights in the Heart of the Earth;</hi> yea the Prophet <hi>Iſa. Chap.</hi> 53.9. Declared our Lord's Funeral, and the Manner of it, long before he was born; <hi>he made his Grave with the wicked, and with the Rich in his Death;</hi> pointing by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at this Tomb of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, who was a Rich Man, and laid him in the Tomb deſigned for himſelf. (3.) He was Buryed to compleat his Humiliation; <hi>They have brought me to the Duſt of Death,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi> a Type of Chriſt. This was the loweſt ſtep he could poſſibly deſcend in his abaſed State; lower he could not be laid, and ſo low his bleſſed Head muſt be laid, elſe he had not been Humbled to the loweſt degree of Humiliation. (4.) Chriſt went into the Grave, that he might Conquer Death in its own Territories and Dominions. His Victory over the Grave, cauſes his Saints to Triumph and Sing, <hi>Oh Grave, where is thy Destruction?</hi> Our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer has perfumed the Bed of the Grave, by his own ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it; ſo that a Pillow of down is not ſo ſoft to a Believer's Head, as a pillow of Duſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, Of
<pb facs="tcp:46556:73"/> what uſe the Doctrine of our Lord's Buryal may be unto us his Diſciples and Followers; (1.) For Inſtruction; Here we ſee the amazing Depths of our Lord's Humiliation, from what, and to what his Love brought him? even from the Boſom of his Father, to the Boſom of the Grave: Oh how doth the depth of his Humiliation ſhew us the Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Satisfaction, and therewith the Heinouſneſs of our Tranſgreſſion. (2.) For Conſolation againſt the fears of Death, and the Grave; the Grave Received Chriſt, but could not Retain him; Death ſwallowed him up, as the Fiſh did <hi>Jonas,</hi> but quickly Vomited him up again; and ſo ſhall it fare with Chriſt Myſtical, as it did with Chriſt Perſonal, as it was done to the Head, ſo ſhall it be done to the Members; the Grave could not long keep him, it ſhall not always keep us; as his Body Reſted in Hope, ſo ſhall ours alſo, and although we ſee Corruption, yet ſhall we not always lye under the Power of Corruption; in <hi>ſhort,</hi> Chriſt's ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Grave, has Changed and Alter'd the Nature of the Grave; it was a Priſon before, a Bed of Reſt now; a Loathſom Grave before, a perfumed Bed now; he whoſe Head is in Heaven, need not fear to put his Feet into the Grave; <hi>Awake, and ſing, thou that dwelleſt in the Duſt,</hi> for the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Grave is ſlain by Chriſt. (3.) For our imitation: Let us ſtudy and endeavour to be Buryed with Chriſt, in reſpect of our ſins I mean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Buryed with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death:</hi> Our ſins ſhould be as a dead Body in ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Are dead Bodies removed out of the Society of Men? ſo ſhould our ſins be removed far from us. Do dead Bodies in the Grave ſpend and conſume by Degrees? ſo ſhould our ſins daily. Will Dead Bodies grow every day more and more Loathſome to others? ſo ſhould our ſins be to our ſelves. Do dead Bodies wax out of Memory, and are quite Forgotten? ſo ſhould our ſins alſo, in reſpect of any delight that we take in the remembring of them; we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Remember our Sins to our Humiliation, but never think or ſpeak of them with the leaſt Delight or Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for this in God's Account is a new Commiſſion of them, and lays us under an aggravated Guilt and Condemnation.</p>

               <p>The Lord of Life was Buryed on the <hi>Fryday,</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Day on which he was Crucified, and his Holy Body Reſted in the ſilent Grave all the next day, and ſome part of the day following. Thus roſe he again the third day, neither ſooner, nor later; not ſooner, leſt the truth of his Death ſhould have been queſtioned, that he did not dye at all; and not later, leſt the Faith of his Diſciples ſhould have failed. Accordingly when the Sabbath was paſt, <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> getting the other Women together, ſhe and they ſet out before day, to viſit the Holy Sepulchre; and about Sun-riſing they get to it, intending with their Spices and Odours farther to Embalm their Lord's Body. Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) That although the Hearts of theſe Holy Women did burn with an ardent Zeal and Affection to their Crucified Lord, yet the Commanded Duties of the Sabbath are not omitted by them; they keep cloſe, and ſilently ſpend that Holy Day in a Mixture of Grief and Hope. A good Pattern of Sabbath-Sanctification, and worthy of our Chriſtian imitation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) Theſe Holy Women go, but not empty-handed: She that had beſtowed a coſtly Alabaſter upon Chriſt, whilſt alive, has prepared no leſs precious Odours for him now dead; thereby paying their laſt Homage to our Saviour's Corpſe: But what need of Odours to Perſume a Body which could not ſee Corruption? True, his Holy Body did not want them, but the Love and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Friends could not with-hold them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (3.) How great a Tribute of Reſpect and Honour is due and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Memory of theſe Holy Women, for their great Magnanimity and Courage. They followed Chriſt when his Cowardly Diſciples left him; they accompanied him to his Croſs, they followed his Hearſe to the Grave, when his Diſciples durſt not appear; and now very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they go to Viſit his Sepulchre, fearing neither the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Night, nor the preſence of the Watch-men. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Courage is the ſpecial Gift of God, and if he gives it to the feebler Sex, even to Timorous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Women, it is not in the power of Men to make them afraid.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And they ſaid among themſelves, Who ſhall roll us away the ſtone from the door of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre? 4 And when they looked, they ſaw that the Stone was Rolled away, for it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. 5 And entring into the Sepulchre, they ſaw a young Man ſitting on the right ſide, cloathed in a long white Garment, and they were afraid. 6 And he ſaith unto them, Be not affrighted, ye ſeek Jeſus of Nazareth, which was Crucified, he is Riſen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him. 7 But go your way, tell his Diſciples and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he goeth before you into Galilee, there ſhall ye ſee him, as he ſaid unto you. 8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the Sepulchre, for they trembled and were amazed neither ſaid they any thing to any Man, for they were afraid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) With what Pomp and Triumph doth our Lord Ariſe? An Angel is ſent from Heaven to roll away the Stone; But could not Chriſt have Riſen without the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Help? yes doubtleſs; he that Raiſed himſelf, could ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Rolled away the Stone; but God thinks fit to ſend an Officer from Heaven, to open the Priſon-door of the Grave, and by ſetting our Surety at Liberty, proclaims our Debt to the Divine Juſtice fully ſatisfied. Beſides it was fit that the Angels who had been Witneſſes of our Saviour's Paſſion, ſhould alſo be Witneſſes of his Reſurrection. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> (2.) Our Lord's Reſurrection declared, <hi>He is Riſen, he is not here.</hi> Almighty God never intended that the darling of his Soul, ſhould be left in an obſcure Sepulchre; <hi>He is not here,</hi> ſaid the Angel, where you laid him, where you left him; Death has loſt its Prey, and the Grave has loſt its Priſoner. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (3.) It is not ſaid, He is not here, for he is Raiſed, but <hi>he is Riſen;</hi> the word imports the Active Power of Chriſt, or the ſelf-quickning Principle by which Chriſt Raiſed himſelf from the Dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. <hi>He ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That it was the Divine Nature, or Godhead of Chriſt, which Raiſed the Humane Nature, from Death to Life; others were Raiſed from the Grave by Chriſt's Power, but he Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf by his own Power. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Witneſs given of our Lord's Reſurrection, that of an Angel in Humane Shape, <hi>A young man cloathed in a long white Garment.</hi> But why is an Angel the firſt Publiſher of our Saviour's Reſurrection? Surely the Dignity of our Lord's Perſon, and the Excellency of his Reſurrection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that it ſhould be thus Publiſhed: How very ſerviceable and officious the Holy Angels were in Attending upon our Saviour in the days of his Fleſh, ſee in the Note on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.6, 7. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The Perſons to whom our Lord's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was firſt declared and made known, to Women, to the two <hi>Mary</hi>'s. But why to Women, and why to theſe Women? why to Women? becauſe God will make choice of weak Means, for producing great Effects; knowing, that the weakneſs of the Inſtrument, redounds to the greater
<pb facs="tcp:46556:74"/> honour of the Agent. In the whole diſpenſation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, God intermixes Divine Power with Humane Weakneſs: Thus the conception of Chriſt was by the power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, but his Mother a poor Woman, a Carpenters Spouſe; ſo the crucifixion of Chriſt was in much meanneſs and outward baſeneſs, being crucified between two Thieves. But the powers of Heaven and Earth trembling, the Rocks rending, the Graves opening, ſhewed a mixture of Divine Power. Thus here, God will honour what inſtruments he pleaſes for the accompliſhment of his own purpoſes; but why to theſe Women the two <hi>Marys</hi> is the firſt diſcovery made of our Saviours Reſurrection? poſſibly it was a reward for their magnanimity and maſculine Courage; theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men clave to Chriſt when the Apoſtles forſook him, they aſſiſted at his Croſs, they attended at his Funeral, they wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Sepulchre; theſe Women had more Courage than the Apoſtles, therefore God makes them Apoſtles to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. This was a tacite Rebuke, a ſecret check given to the Apoſtles, that they ſhould be thus out done by Women; theſe holy Women went before the Apoſtles in the laſt Services that were done for Chriſt, and therefore the Apoſtles here come after them in their Rewards and Comforts. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (6.) The Evidence which the Angels offers to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to evince and prove the verity and certainty of our Saviour's Reſurrection, namely, by an appeal to their ſenſes, <hi>behold the place where they laid him;</hi> the ſenſes when rightly diſpoſed are the proper judges of all ſenſible Objects, and accordingly Chriſt himſelf did appeal to his Diſciples ſenſes concerning the Truth of his own Reſurrection, <hi>Behold my Hands, and my Feet that it is I my ſelf;</hi> and indeed if we muſt not believe our Senſes, we ſhall want the beſt external Evidence for the proof of the certainty and truth of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>namely,</hi> the Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: For what Aſſurance can we have of the reallity of thoſe Miracles, but from our Senſes, therefore ſays our Saviour, <hi>if ye believe not me, yet believe the works that I do,</hi> that is, the Miracles which I have wrought before your Eyes. Now as my Senſes tell me that Chriſt's Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were true, ſo they aſſure me, that the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is falſe. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> That the the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by the Omnipotent Power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, revived and roſe again from the dead, the third day to the Terror and Conſternation of his Enemies, and the unſpeakable joy and conſolation of Believers. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, the quick diſpatch made of the joyful news of our Lord's Reſurrection to the ſorrowful Diſciples, <hi>go tell the Diſciples,</hi> ſays the Angel, <hi>go tell my Brethren,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.10. Chriſt might have ſaid, go tell thoſe Apoſtate Apoſtles that cowardly left me in my danger, that durſt not own me in the High-prieſts Hall, that durſt not come within the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of my Croſs, nor within ſight of my Sepulchre; not a word of this by way of upbraiding them for their late ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cowardize, but all words of Kindneſs. <hi>Go tell my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> where <hi>Note,</hi> That Chriſt calls them Brethren after his Reſurrection and Exaltation, thereby ſhewing that the change of his condition had wrought no change in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards his poor Diſciples, but thoſe that were his Brethren before in the time of his Abaſement, are ſo ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Exaltation and Advancement; <hi>Go tell my Brethren,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Go tell my Diſciples and Peter,</hi> ſays the Angel. Where <hi>Note,</hi> That St. <hi>Peter</hi> is here particularly named, not becauſe of his primacy and ſuperiority over the reſt of the Apoſtles as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have it; but becauſe he had denied Chriſt, and for that denial was ſwallowed up with ſorrow and ſtood moſt in need of comfort; therefore ſays Chriſt by the Angel, ſpeak particularly to <hi>Peter,</hi> be ſure that his ſad heart be comforted with this joyful news, that he may know that I am friends with him, notwithſtanding his late Cowardize. <hi>Tell the Diſciples and Peter; that he goeth before you into Galilee;</hi> but why into <hi>Galilee?</hi> becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was now a forſaken place, a people abandoned to deſtruction, but <hi>Galilee</hi> was a place where Chriſt's Miniſtry was more acceptable. Such places ſhall be moſt Honoured with Chriſt's preſence, where his Goſpel is moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Now when Jeſus was riſen from the dead early, the firſt day of the week he appeared firſt to Mary Magdalen out of whom he had caſt ſeven Devils 10 And ſhe went and told them that had been with him, as they mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wept. 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been ſeen of her, believed not. 12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked and went into the Country. 13 And they went and told it unto the reſidue, neither believed they them. 14 Afterward he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the eleven, as they ſat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, becauſe they believed not them which had ſeen him after he was riſen.</p>
               <p>An account is here given of a three-fold appearance of Chriſt after his Reſurrection. (1). To <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> not to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and it is obſervable that our Bleſſed Saviour, after his Reſurrection, firſt appeared to <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> a grievous Sinner, for the comfort of all true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. <hi>Mary</hi> goes immediately to his Diſciples whom ſhe finds weeping and mourning, and tells them, <hi>ſhe had ſeen the Lord, but they believed her not.</hi> The ſecond appearance was to the two Diſciples going into the Country, that is, into the Village of <hi>Emaus;</hi> as they were in the way, Jeſus joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to their Company, <hi>but there Eyes were holden</hi> by the power of God, that they did not diſcern him in his own proper ſhape, but apprehended him to be another Perſon whom they converſed with. His third appearance was <hi>to the Eleven as they ſat at Meat, whom he upbraids with their unbelief,</hi> and to convince them effectually, that he was riſen from the dead, <hi>he eats with them a piece of a broiled Fiſh, and of an Honey Comb,</hi> not that he needed it, being he was now become immortal, but to aſſure them he had ſtill the ſame Body. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> how induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly our Lord endeavours to confirm his Diſciples Faith in the Doctrine of his Reſurrection, ſo ſlack and backward they were to believe that the Meſſiah was riſen again from the dead, that all the predictions of Scripture, all the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances they had received from our Saviour's mouth, yea, all the appearances of our Saviour to them, after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally riſen from the dead, were little enough to confirm and eſtabliſh them in the certain belief that he was riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And he ſaid unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 16 He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believed not, ſhall be damned.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour gives commiſſion to his Diſciples to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate and gather a Chriſtian Church out of all Nations, <hi>to go forth and preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> that is, to all reaſonable Creatures that are capable of it, not to the Jews only, but to the Gentiles alſo, without any diſtinction of Country, Age or Sex whatſoever. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, that the Apoſtles and firſt planters of the Goſpel, had a commiſſion from Chriſt to go amongſt the Pagan Gentiles without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or diſtinction, to inſtruct them in the ſavin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> that is, he that receiveth and embraceth the Goſpel preached by you, and thereupon becomes a Proſelite and Diſciple of Chriſt, and receives Baptiſm the Seal of the new Covenant, ſhall for all his former ſins receive Pardon, and upon his perſeverance obtain Eternal Life; but he that ſtands out obſtinately and impenitently, ſhall certainly be damned. The two damning ſins under the Goſpel are Infidelity and Hypocriſy, not receiving Chriſt for Lord and Saviour by ſome, or doing this feignedly by others, happy are they in whom the preaching of the Goſpel produces ſuch a Faith as is the parent and principle of Obedience, <hi>he that ſo believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17 And theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe, in my Name ſhall they caſt out Devils,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:74"/> they ſhall ſpeak with new tongues. 18 They ſhall tkae up Serpents, and if they drink any thing, it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay deadly hands on the ſick and they ſhall recover.</p>
               <p>Here we have a gracious promiſe of Chriſt, that in order to the ſpreading and propagating of the Goſpel as far as may be, the Spirit ſhould be poured forth abundantly from on high upon the Apoſtles, and thereby they ſhould be enabled to work Miracles, to caſt out Devils, to ſpeak ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which we read they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And this power of working Miracles continued in the Church an hundred years after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, untill Chriſtianity had taken rooting in the hearts of men, <hi>Ireneus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 58. ſays, that many believers beſides the Apoſtles had this power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; as new ſet plants are watered at firſt, till they have taken faſt rooting, ſo that the Chriſtian Faith might grow the faſter: God watered it with miracles at its firſt Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That all the Miracles which they had power to work, were healing and beneficent, not terrifying judgments, but acts of kindneſs and mercy; it was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours deſign to bring over perſons to Chriſtianity by Lenity, Mildneſs and Gentleneſs, not to affright them into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with aſtoniſhing judgments which might affect their fear, but little influence their Faith; for the will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of perſons to the principles of any Religion (eſpecially the Chriſtian) is like a royal fort which muſt not be ſtorm'd by violence, but taken by ſurrender.</p>
               <p n="19">19 So then after the Lord had ſpoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and ſat on the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>Here we have that grand Article of our Chriſtian Faith aſſerted, <hi>namely,</hi> our Saviour's aſcenſion into Heaven, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his exaltation there, expreſſed by his <hi>ſetting at God's right hand;</hi> he aſcended now to Heaven in his humane Nature, for in his Divine Nature he was there already; and it was neceſſary that he ſhould thus aſcend in order to his own perſonal Exaltation and Glorification. When he was on Earth, his Humility, Patience, and Self-denial were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by undergoing God's Wrath, the Devil's Rage, and man's Cruelty. Now he goes to Heaven that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; he that is a patient Sufferer upon Earth, ſhall be a triumphant Conqueror in Heaven, alſo with reſpect to his Church on Earth, was it needful and neceſſary that our Lord ſhould aſcend up into Heaven; namely, to ſend down the Holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles, which he did at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt. <hi>If I go not away</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>the Comforter will not come, but if I depart, I will ſend him to you;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be a powerful Advocate and Interceſſor with his Father in Heaven, on the behalf of his Church and Children here upon Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Chriſt is entered into Heaven it ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for us;</hi> finally, Chriſt aſcended into Heaven to give us an aſſurance, that in due time we ſhould aſcend after him, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. <hi>I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you,</hi> hence the Apoſtle calls our Saviour, <hi>Our fore-runner,</hi> Heb. 6. v. 19.

The vaſt ſpreading of the Goſpel ſo far in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, for in thirty Years time after Chriſt's death, it was ſpread through the greateſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and reached as far as <hi>Parthia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> (2.) The wonderful power and efficacy which the Goſpel had upon the lives and manners of men, the generality of thoſe that entertained the Goſpel were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to it, both in word and deed; becauſe Chriſtianity being an hated and perſecuted profeſſion, no man could have any inducement to embrace it that did not reſolve to practiſe it, and live up unto it. (3.) The weakneſs and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Inſtruments that were imployed in propagating the Goſpel, ſhews the ſucceſs of it to be very great and ſtrange; a company of plain and illiterate Men, moſt of them deſtitute of the advantages of Education, and unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the countenance of any Authority whatſoever; yet did they in a ſhort ſpace draw the World after them. (4.) The powerful oppoſition which was raiſed againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>namely,</hi> the prejudices of Education, the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Luſts, and alſo the powers of the World then in being, did ſtrongly combine againſt it; yet did Chriſtianity bear up againſt all this oppoſition, and made its way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all the reſiſtance that the Luſts and prejudices of Men armed with the power and authority of the whole world could make againſt it. (5.) The great diſcouragements that Men were then under to embrace the Goſpel and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion; all the evils of this World threatned them, Mockings and Scourgings, Baniſhment and Impriſonment, Reproach and Ruin, death in all its fearful ſhapes was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, to deter them from embracing this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Obſerve</hi> therefore, (2.) The reaſon of this wonderful Succeſs <hi>the Lord wrought with them, and confirmed the word with Signs following,</hi> the Lord wrought with them; this points at the inward operation of the Holy Spirit upon the minds of Men, and confirmed the word with Signs, that is, confirmed their Doctrine with Miracles, ſuch as healing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, raiſing the Dead, caſting out Devils, inflicting corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſeaſes on ſcandalous perſons, and ſometimes Death it ſelf; from the whole we gather the Truth and Divinity of the Chriſtian Religion, that it was and is certainly of God, and therefore never could, never can be overthrown.</p>

               <p>This Goſpel, together with the Acts of the Apoſtles, were written by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the beloved Phyſician and Companion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote, as did the reſt of the Evangeliſts, by the ſpecial Direction and Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; where we may profitably Remark, the wonderful wiſdom of God, who in Order to the Confirming of our Faith in the Truth of the Goſpel, raiſed up a ſufficient number of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to teſtify the verity and infallible certainty of all that the Goſpel delivers to us. Now this Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates this Goſpel, together with the Acts of the Apoſtles, to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who was, as ſome think, an Honourable Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; or a Renowned and eminent Perſon in the Church, as Others ſuppoſe: But many take the word <hi>Theophilus</hi> not for a proper Name, but common Name, ſignifying every one that <hi>Loveth God;</hi> to whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> addreſſes his Diſcourſe. The firſt four Verſes of this Chapter are a Preface to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hiſtory, and acquaint us with the Reaſons which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced St. <hi>Luke</hi> to write, namely, becauſe divers Perſons in that Age, had imprudently and inconſiderately ſet upon wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Goſpels, without direction from the Spirit of God, whoſe Errors and Miſtakes were to be corrected by a true Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. This St. <hi>Luke</hi> declare he was able to make, having had perfect Underſtanding and Knowledge of the Truth of thoſe things he was about to Relate; partly by his familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and partly by his Converſation with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, who conſtantly attending our Saviour, were Eye, and Ear-witneſſes of thoſe things that are the Subject matter of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5 There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain Prieſt named Zacharias, of the courſe of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</p>
               <p>In this and the following Verſes, the Holy Ghoſt gives us a Deſcription of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who was the Harbinger, and Fore-runner of our Saviour Chriſt; he is deſcribed, firſt by his Parentage, being the Son of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> This <hi>Zacharias</hi> was a Prieſt who had a Courſe in the Temple, or a right to officiate there when it came to his turn; for we read in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.10. That <hi>David appointed the Prieſts the Sons of Aaron, to miniſter by Turns, and divided them into four and Twenty Courſes.</hi> Every one Miniſtring in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their Weeks. Here <hi>Note,</hi> That <hi>Zacharias</hi> a Prieſt, and attending the Service of the Temple, was a married Perſon, having one of the Daughters of <hi>Aaron</hi> to Wife, according to the command of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.14. where the Prieſt is required to marry one of his own Tribe. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That neither the Prieſts under the Law did, nor the Miniſters of Chriſt under the Goſpel ought to abhor the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Bed; nor judge themſelves too pure for an Inſtitution of their Maker. The Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome, which forbiddeth to marry,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls, <hi>a Doctrine of Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lord blameleſs.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:77"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here (1.) The ſweet harmony of this Religious Couple in the ways of God, <hi>They both walked in the commandments of God.</hi> It is an happy match when Husband and Wife are one, not only in themſelves, but in the Lord. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of their Holineſs and Obedience, <hi>they walked,</hi> not in ſome, but <hi>in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the Lord.</hi> Such as will approve themſelves to be ſincerely religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, muſt make Conſcience of every known Duty, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obey every Precept and Command of God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The high Commendation which the Holy Spirit of God gives of this their Religious Courſe of Holineſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, They are pronounced <hi>Blameleſs.</hi> He that liveth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out groſs Sin in a Goſpel Senſe, liveth blameleſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin. To live without groſs Sin is our Holineſs on Earth, to be without any ſin, will be our Happineſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many ſins may be in him that has true Grace, but he that has Truth of Grace, cannot allow himſelf in any Sin. Such are the Condeſcenſions of the Covenant of Grace, that ſincere Obedience is called Perfection. Truth of Grace is our perfection on Earth, but in Heaven we ſhall have Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as well as Truth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, a pattern for their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation who wait at God's Altar, and are imployed in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Holy Things, ſuch ought all the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and their Wives to be, what <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are here ſaid to be; namely, <hi>Blameleſs;</hi> that is very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and inoffenſive in their daily Converſation.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And they had no child, becauſe that Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth was barren; and they both were now well ſtricken in years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) This Holy pair <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were fruitful in Holy Obedience, but Barren in Children: a Fruitful Soul, and a Barren Womb are Conſiſtent, and do oft-times meet together. This Religious Couple made no leſs progreſs in Virtue then in Age, and yet their Virtue could not make their Age Fruitful. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was barren in the Flower of her Age, but much more ſo in old Age. Here was a double obſtacle, and conſequently a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance of Divine Power in the Birth of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> ſhewing him to be a Prophet very extraordinary, and miraculouſly ſent by God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) That when Almighty God in old Times did long delay to give in the Bleſſing of Children to Holy Women, he rewarded their Expectation with the Birth of ſome Eminent and Extraordinary Perſon. Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> after long Barrenneſs brought forth an <hi>Iſaac, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccah,</hi> a <hi>Jacob, Rachel</hi> a <hi>Joſeph, Hannah</hi> a <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> St. <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> When God makes his People wait long for a particular Mercy, if he ſees it good for them, he gives it in at laſt with a double Reward for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And it came to paſs, that while he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Prieſts office before God, in the order of his courſe. 9 According to the cuſtom of the Prieſts office, his lot was to burn incenſe, when he went into the Temple of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That none but a Son of <hi>Aaron</hi> might offer Incenſe to God in the Temple; and not every Son of <hi>Aaron</hi> neither, nay, not any of them at all Seaſons. God is a God of Order, and hates Confuſion, no leſs than Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as under the Law of old, ſo under the Goſpel at this Day, <hi>no man ought to take this honour upon him, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Obſ.</hi> (2.) That there were Courſes of Miniſtration in the Legal Services, in which the Prieſts did relieve one another weekly. God never purpoſed to burthen any of his Servants with Devotion, nor is he pleaſed when his Service is made burthenſome, either to, or by his Miniſters. Many of the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſerved together in the Temple, according to the variety of their Imployments, which were aſſigned them by Lot: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it fell out at this time, that <hi>Zachary</hi> was choſen by Lot to burn Incenſe. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) That Morning and Evening, twice a day, the Prieſts offered up their Incenſe to God, that both parts of the day might be Conſecrated to him, who was the Maker and Giver of their Time. This Incenſe offered up under the Law, repreſents our Prayers offered to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. Theſe Almighty God expects that we ſhould (all his Church over) ſend up to him, Morning and Evening. The Ejaculatory Elevations of our Hearts ſhould be perpetual, but if Twice a day we do not preſent God with our Solemn Invocations; we make the Goſpel leſs officious then the Law; and can we reaſonably think that Almighty God will accept of leſs now then would content him then?</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the whole Multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of Incenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) While the Incenſe was burning, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were Praying; whilſt the Prieſt ſends up his Incenſe in the Temple within, the People ſend up their Prayers in the Court without. The Incenſe of the Prieſt, and the Prayers of the People, meet; and go up to Heaven together. Hence <hi>Learn;</hi> That it is a Bleſſed thing when both Miniſter and People jointly offer up their Prayers for each other at the ſame Throne of Grace, and mutually ſtrive together in their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications one with, and one for another. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) How both Prieſt and People keep their place and Station; the Prieſt Burns Incenſe in the Holy place, and the People offer up their Prayers in the outward Court. The people might no more go into the Holy place to offer up their Prayers, then <hi>Zachary</hi> might go into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> to burn Incenſe. Whilſt the Partition-Wall ſtood betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> there was alſo a partition betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and themſelves. But now under the Goſpel every Man is a Prieſt to God, and may enter the Holy of Holies by the Blood of Jeſus. But Lord! What are we the better for this Great and Gracious freedom of Acceſs to Thee, if we want Hearts to prize and to improve our Priviledge.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And there appeared unto him an Angel of the Lord, ſtanding on the right ſide of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Incenſe.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Zachary</hi> was praying to God, an Angel appears to <hi>Zachary;</hi> when we are neareſt God, the Good Angels are nigheſt us; they are moſt with us, when we are moſt with him. The preſence of Angels with us is no Novelty, but their Apparition to us is ſo. They are always with us, but rarely ſeen by us. Let our Faith ſee them, whom our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cannot diſcern: Their aſſumed Shapes do not make them more preſent, but only more viſible. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The place as well as the time where the Angel appeared, in the Temple and at the Altar, and <hi>on the right ſide of the Altar of Incenſe.</hi> As the Holy Angels are always preſent with us in our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo eſpecially in Religious Aſſemblies, as in all places, ſo moſt of all in God's Houſe; They rejoyce to be with us, whilſt we are with God, but they turn their Faces from us when we go about our Sins.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And when Zacharias ſaw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</p>
               <p>It was partly the ſuddenneſs, partly the unexpectedneſs, and partly the Glory of the Apparition, that affrighted this Good Man. Glorious and ſudden Apparations do affright e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the holieſt and beſt of Men. We cannot bear the ſight and preſence of an Angel without Conſternation and Fear in this our frail and ſinful State. Oh happy hour, when mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Sin being taken out of our Natures, we ſhall not only behold the Glorified Angels without fear, but the Glorious God, with Delight and Love. Lord! let me now ſee Thee by Faith, hereafter by ſight. <hi>Sit in alio Seculo, non in Hoc! viſio tua, merces mea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13 But the Angel ſaid unto him, fear not Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth ſhall bear thee a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name John.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How Apprehenſive this good Angel was of <hi>Zachary</hi>'s Surprizing fear, and encourages him againſt it. The Holy Angels, tho' they do not expreſs it in words, yet they pity our frailties, and ſuggeſt Comfort to us. The Evil Angels if they might, would kill us with Terrour: The good Angels labour altogether for our Tranquility and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. <hi>The Angel ſaid unto him, fear not. Obſ.</hi> (2.) the Comfortable words ſpoken by the Angel to <hi>Zacharias, Thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth ſhall bear thee a Son.</hi> No doubt <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had often prayed for a Child, and now God ſends them one, when they leaſt expected it. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſometimes God gives in a Mercy to us when we leaſt expect it; yea, when we have given over look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it. No doubt this was the Caſe here. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth being both well stricken in Age. Obſ.</hi> (3.) the Name
<pb facs="tcp:46556:77"/> which the Angel directs <hi>Zachary</hi> to give his Son; <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name John,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Gracious,</hi> becauſe he was to open the Kingdom of Grace, and to preach the Grace of the Goſpel through Jeſus Chriſt. The giving of ſignificant names to Children has been an ancient and pious practice; Names which either carried a Remembrance of Duty, or of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And thou ſhalt have joy and gladneſs, and many ſhall rejoice at his birth. 15 For he ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord, and ſhall drink neither wine, nor ſtrong drink, and he ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, even from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb. 16 And many of the Children of Iſrael ſhall he turn to the Lord their God. 17 And he ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the juſt, to make ready a people prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Lord.</p>
               <p>Here the Angel declares to <hi>Zachary</hi> what kind of Son ſhould be born unto him, even one of eminent Endowments, and deſigned for extraordinary Services. The proof of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren makes them either the Bleſſings or Croſſes of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. What greater comfort could <hi>Zachary</hi> deſire in a child then is here promiſed to him? (1.) he hears of a Son that ſhould <hi>bring joy to himſelf, and many others,</hi> even to all that did expect the coming of the Meſſias, whoſe fore-runner the Baptiſt was. (2.) <hi>That he ſhould be great in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> that is, a Perſon of great Eminency, and great Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Church. A Perſon of great Riches and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is great in the ſight of Men; but the Man of great ability and uſefulneſs, the Man of great Integrity and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs, he is truly <hi>great in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> They are <hi>little Men in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> that live in the World to little purpoſes, who do little Service for God, and bring little Honour and Glory to him: But the Man that does all the poſſible Service he can for God, and the utmoſt Good that he is capable of doing to all Mankind; he is a perſon <hi>great in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> and ſuch was the <hi>Holy Baptiſt.</hi> (3.) It is foretold that he ſhould <hi>drink neither Wine nor strong drink,</hi> that is, that he ſhould be a very Temperate and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious Perſon, living after the manner of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> tho' he was not ſeparated by any Vow of his own, or his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but by the ſpecial deſignation and appointment of God only. It was forbidden the Prieſts under the Law to drink either Wine or ſtrong Drink, upon pain of Death, during the time of their Miniſtration, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.9. And the Miniſters of Chriſt under the Goſpel, are forbidden to <hi>be lovers of Wine,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. (4.) <hi>He ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt from his Mothers Womb;</hi> That is, he ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed abundantly with the extraordinary Gifts and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Graces of the Holy Spirit, which ſhall very early appear to be in him, and upon him. (5.) His High and Honourable Office is declared, <hi>That he ſhould go before the Meſſiah,</hi> as his Harbinger and Fore-runner, with the ſame Spirit of Zeal and Courage againſt Sin, which was found in the old Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> whom he did ſo nearly reſemble. (6.) The great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Miniſtry is foretold, namely, <hi>That he ſhould turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt;</hi> That is, the Hearts of the Jews to the Gentiles, ſay ſome, that he ſhould bring Men (ſay others) even the moſt diſobedient and rebellious Phariſees and Sadduces, Publicans and Sinners unto Repentance, and to the minding of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and all moral duties; and <hi>thus he made ready a people for the Lord.</hi> By fitting men to receive Chriſt upon his own Terms and Conditions; namely, Faith, and Repentance. From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> That thoſe whom Almighty God deſigns for eminent Uſefulneſs in his Church, he furniſhes with Endowments ſuitable to their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and when he calls to extraordinary Service, comes in with more then Ordinary Aſſiſtance. Here was the Holy Baptiſt extraordinarily called, and as extraordinarily furniſhed for his Office and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And Zacharias ſaid unto the Angel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhall I know this, for I am an old man, and my wife well ſtricken in years? 19 And the Angel anſwering ſaid unto him, I am Gabriel that ſtand in the preſence of God, and am ſent to ſpeak unto thee, and to ſhew thee theſe glad tidings. 20 And behold thou ſhalt be dumb, and not able to ſpeak, until the day that theſe things ſhall be performed, becauſe thou believeſt not my words, which ſhall be fulfilled in their ſeaſon. 21 And the people waited for Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias, and marvelled that he tarried ſo long in the Temple. 22 And when he came out, he could not ſpeak unto them: and they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he had ſeen a Viſion in the Temple: for he beckned unto them, and remained ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, <hi>Zachary</hi> being ſlow to believe ſo ſtrange a Meſſage, aske the Angel by what Sign he ſhould know that this thing, ſo far above the ordinary Courſe of Nature, ſhould come to paſs. The Angel anſwers, that he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatcht by God as a Meſſenger extraordinary to declare this good News to him. And ſeeing he was ſo hard to believe it, and required a Sign, he ſhould have it, but ſuch an one as ſhould be a puniſhment of his unbelief, as well as a Sign to confirm his faith; namely, he ſhould from thence forward, to the Birth of the Child, be dumb and deaf, as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word ſignifies; becauſe he had not hearkned to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Speech, he was ſtruck deaf, and becauſe he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid it, he was made dumb. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the word of God in the mouth of his Meſſengers, is God's own word, and as ſuch to be received and believed. (2.) That not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their word is a ſin which God will ſeverely puniſh; it is all one not to believe God, and not to believe the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God ſpeaking from him: Some Expoſitors will have this Dumbneſs of <hi>Zachary</hi> to be prefigurative. The Prieſt at the diſmiſſion of the People, when the Service of the Temple was finiſhed, was to pronounce the Bleſſing Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.24, 25. which when <hi>Zachary</hi> was about to do, he is ſtruck dumb, and cannot perform it. Signifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the ſilencing of the Levitical Prieſthood was now at hand; that they muſt expect another kind of Worſhip, and that he who was to bleſs indeed, namely, the Meſſias was near at hand. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, That though <hi>Zachary</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſpeak, yet he did not ceaſe to miniſter, he takes not his dumbneſs for a diſmiſſion, but ſtays out the eight days of his Courſe, knowing that the ſervice of his heart and hand would be accepted of that God which had bereaved him of his Tongue. Thoſe powers which we have, we muſt make uſe of in the publick Service of God, who will accept us according to what we have; pardoning our Infirmity, and rewarding our Sincerity.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And it came to paſs, that as ſoon as the days of his miniſtration were accompliſhed, he departed to his own houſe. 24 And after thoſe days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid her ſelf five months, ſaying: 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts during the time of their Adminiſtration, had their Lodgings in Buildings appertaining to the Temple. <hi>Zachary</hi> having ended his Adminiſtration, leaves his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and returns to his Houſe, where his Wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, <hi>ſhe hides her ſelf;</hi> that is, Retires from Company, partly to prevent the Diſcourſe of people, until it was out of all doubt that ſhe had conceived: And partly to give her ſelf opportunity of returning her Thankful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto God, who had given her this Miraculous Mercy; and had thereby taken away her Reproach of Barrenneſs, which was ſo heavy and inſupportable among the Jews. <hi>Note</hi> here two things, (1.) How <hi>piouſly Elizabeth</hi> aſcribes this mercy to the power of God. <hi>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me.</hi> 'Tis God that keeps the Key of the Womb in his own hand, and maketh the Fruit of it his Reward, and therefore Children are to be owned as his ſpecial Gift. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) how great a Reproach Bodily Barrenneſs is, in the ſight
<pb facs="tcp:46556:78"/> of Man; but not ſo great as Spiritual Barrenneſs in the ſight of God: For this is at once a Reproach to God, a Reproach to Religion, a Reproach to Profeſſors, and to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And in the ſixth month, the Angel Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el was ſent from God, unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth. 27 To a Virgin eſpouſed to a man, whoſe name was Joſeph, of the houſe of David, and the Virgins name was Mary. 28 And the Angel came in unto her, and ſaid, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee, bleſſed art thou among women. 29 And when ſhe ſaw him, ſhe was troubled at his ſaying, and caſt in her mind, what manner of Salutation this ſhould be. 30 And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaid unto her, fear not, Mary: for thou haſt found favour with God. 31 And behold, thou ſhalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son: and ſhalt call his name Jeſus. 32 He ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Son of the Higheſt. And the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father David. 33 And he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever: and of his kingdom there ſhall be no end.</p>
               <p>In this Hiſtory of our Saviours miraculous and immaculate Conception, we have ſeveral things <hi>Obſerveable,</hi> as (1.) The Meſſenger ſent from Heaven to publiſh the News of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Son of God, an <hi>Angel:</hi> an evil Angel was the firſt Author of our Ruine: a good Angel could not be the <hi>Author</hi> of our Reſtauration, but is the joyful Reporter of it: <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Angels Name, <hi>Gabriel,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the power of God: The ſame Angel who had many hundred years before declared to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Coming of the Meſſiah. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The place which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is ſent unto, <hi>Nazareth,</hi> an obſcure place; little taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, yea a City in <hi>Galilee,</hi> out of which ariſes no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, even there doth the God of Prophets condeſcend to be Conceived. No blind corner of <hi>Nazareth</hi> can hide the Bleſſed Virgin from the Angel. The favours of God will find out his Children wherever they are withdrawn. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Perſon whom the Angel is ſent unto, <hi>To a Virgin eſpouſed, whoſe name was Mary.</hi> For the Honour of Virginity, Chriſt choſe a Virgin for his Mother; for the Honour of Marriage, a Virgin eſpouſed to an Husband. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) The Meſſage it ſelf; <hi>Hail thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee, Bleſſed art thou among Women.</hi> Where Note, that the Angel Salutes the Virgin as a <hi>Saint,</hi> he doth not pray to her as a <hi>Goddeſs.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Idolatrouſly uſe theſe words, as a Prayer to the Holy Virgin, (ſaying Ten <hi>Ave Marys</hi> for one <hi>Pater Noſter</hi>) whereas they are only a Salutation: decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſhe, above all Women, had the honour freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by God upon her, to be the mother of the Meſſiah. The Original word ſignifies, not full of Grace, but freely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: Compare <hi>Mary</hi> with other Renowned Women, and what had ſhe (beſides this favour) more then they? Had ſhe the Spirit of Prophecy? ſo had they; had ſhe the Spirit of Sanctification? ſo had they: And ſhe had no more immunity and freedom from Sin and Death then they. Accordingly ſays the Angel, <hi>Bleſſed art thou among Women:</hi> He doth not ſay, Bleſſed art Thou <hi>above Women:</hi> Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be as copious as they will in the Commendation of the Mother, ſo they do not derogate from the Glory of the Son: But how ſenſeleſs are they, (1.) in turning a Salutation into a Prayer, (2.) in making uſe of theſe words upon every occaſion, which were ſpoken by an Angel upon a ſpecial occaſion. (3.) In ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying theſe words to her now in Heaven, which ſuited with her only when ſhe was here on Earth, ſaying, <hi>full of Grace,</hi> to her who is full of Glory; and <hi>the Lord is with Thee,</hi> to her that is <hi>with the Lord. Obſ.</hi> (6.) The effect which the Sight and Salutation of the Angel had upon the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; ſhe was afraid. If <hi>Zachary</hi> before her were amazed at the ſight of the Angel, much more the Virgin, her Sex ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting her to fear. All paſſions, but particularly the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear, diſquiets the Heart, and makes it unfit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Meſſages of God. Therefore the Angel inſtantly ſays unto her, <hi>fear not,</hi> let Joy enter into thy Heart, out of whoſe Womb ſhall come Salvation. Thus the fears of holy Perſons do end in Comfort: Joy was the Errand which the Angel came upon, and not Terrour; what little cauſe had ſhe to fear the preſence of an Angel, who was ſo highly favoured of him at whom the Angels tremble? But we ſee the holieſt Perſon on Earth, cannot bear the preſence of an <hi>Holy Angel,</hi> much leſs the preſence of an <hi>Holy God;</hi> nor ſtand before the manifeſtations of his Favours: Lord! How unable then will the wicked be at the Great day, to ſtand before the manifeſtation of thy Fury. If the ſight of an Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel now, makes the beſt of Saints to quake and tremble, What will the ſight of an infinitely Holy and Juſt God then do? when the wicked ſhall be ſlain by the brightneſs of his preſence. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, The Character which the Angel gives of the perſon that ſhould be Born of the Bleſſed Virgin, <hi>He ſhall be Great, and called the Son of the Higheſt. Great,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Perſon. <hi>Great,</hi> in reſpect of his Offices. <hi>Great,</hi> in reſpect of his Kingdom. For God would ſettle upon him a Spiritual Kingdom, (of which <hi>David</hi>'s Earthly one was a Type) which ſhall never be aboliſhed, Tho' the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by the Word and Sacraments ſhall ceaſe at the day of Judgment, when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom, (in that reſpect) to his Father. All other Kingdoms have had, or ſhall have their Periods, but the Goſpel-Church, which is Chriſt's Kingdom, ſhall continue, till his Kingdom of Glory be Revealed.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Then ſaid Mary to the Angel: How ſhall this be, ſeeing I know not a man? 35 And the Angel ſaid unto her, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall over-ſhadow thee: Therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of God. 36 And behold, thy cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Elizabeth, ſhe hath alſo conceived a Son in her old age: and this is the ſixth month with her which is called Barren. 37 For with God nothing ſhall be unpoſſible. 38 And Mary ſaid, Behold, the hand-maid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word: and the Angel departed from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Virgins queſtion, <hi>How ſhall this be?</hi> This queſtion did not import her denial of the poſſibility of the thing, but her wonder at the ſtrangeneſs of the thing; it proceeded rather from a deſire of information, than from a doubt of Infidelity. Therefore ſhe doth not ſay, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, nor how can this be? <hi>but how ſhall this be?</hi> She doth not diſtruſt, but demand, how her Virginity ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fruitful, and how ſhe, being a Virgin, could bring forth a Son? <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Angels Reply to the Virgins que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> the Angel declares the Author, who, but not the manner how: The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, but in what way, and after what manner is not declared: No Mother knows the manner of her Natural Conception; What preſumption had it then been for the Mother of the Meſſiah, to have inquired how the Son of God could take Fleſh and Blood of his Creature. It is for none but the Almighty to know thoſe Works which do immediately concern himſelf. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Holy and Immaculate Conception of our Bleſſed Redeemer: <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the moſt High ſhall over-ſhadow thee, wherefore that Holy thing that ſhall be born of thee,</hi> That is, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall prepare and ſanctify ſo much of thy Fleſh, Blood, or Seed, as ſhall conſtitute the Body of Chriſt. For tho' it was the work of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet it is aſcribed particularly to the Holy Ghoſt, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication being his peculiar work. And the Title and Epithet of <hi>That Holy Thing,</hi> ſheweth the purity and immaculateneſs of Chriſt's Humane Nature, and that none was ever Born thus Holy and Immaculate but Chriſt only; becauſe none had ever ſuch a way and means of Conception, but only he, <hi>Therefore that Holy thing ſhall be called the Son of God,</hi> not conſtituted and made, but evidenced and declared. Chriſt was God before he aſſumed Fleſh, even from Eternity; but
<pb facs="tcp:46556:78"/> but his taking Fleſh in this manner evidences him to be the Son of God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Argument uſed by the Angel to confirm <hi>Many</hi> in the Belief of what he had told her, namely, the wonderful Conception of her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth in her old Age;</hi> who was now <hi>ſix Months gone with Child.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) What an exact Knowledge God has, and what a particular Notice he takes of all the Children of men, he knoweth not only our ſelves, but our Relations alſo; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Couſin Elizabeth;</hi> the knowledge which God has of every Perſon, and every Action, is a clear and diſtinct Knowledge. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) How the Angel ſtrengthens her Faith, by a Conſideration drawn from the Almighty power of God; <hi>With God nothing ſhall be unpoſſible;</hi> be it never ſo ſtrange and difficult, there is no ſuch way to overcome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, as by ſtrengthning our Faith in the Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. Faith will enable us to aſſent to Truths, though ſeemingly incredible, and to believe the poſſibility of things tho' appearingly impoſſible. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, how the Virgin expreſſes her Faith and Obedience, her Submiſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Reſignation to the Divine pleaſure, to be diſpoſed of by God as he thought fit; <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.</hi> We hear of no more Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or Interrogations, but an humble and ſubmiſſive Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that a Gracious Heart, when once it underſtands the pleaſure of God, argues no farther, but qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly Reſts in a Believing Expectation of what God will do. All diſputations with God, after his Will is made known and underſtood, ariſe from Infidelity and Unbelief. The Virgin having thus Conſented, inſtantly Conceived by the Over-ſhadowing Power of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="39">39 And Mary aroſe in thoſe days, and went into the Hill-country with haſte, into a City of Judah. 40 And entred into the houſe of Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, and ſaluted Elizabeth. 41 And it came to paſs, that when Elizabeth heard the Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghoſt. 42 And ſhe ſpake out with aloud voice, and ſaid, Bleſſed art thou among women, and bleſſed is the fruit of thy womb. 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me? 44 For lo: as ſoon as the voice of thy Salutation ſounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 45 And bleſſed is ſhe that believed, for there ſhall be a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Viſit made by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Holy Virgin had underſtood by the Angel, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was no leſs akin to her in Condition, than in Relation; being both Fruitful in Conception; ſhe haſtens into the Hill-country to Viſit that Holy Matron: The Two Wonders of the World were now met under one Roof, to Congratulate their mutual Happineſs; only the meeting of the Saints in Heaven can parallel the meeting of theſe two Saints on Earth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The deſign and intention of this Viſit, which was partly to Communicate their Joys each to other, and partly to ſtrengthen the Faith of each other: Such a Soul as has Chriſt Spiritually Conceived in it, is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and cannot be quiet till it has imparted its joy. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The effect of the Virgins Salutation; She had no ſooner Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>Elizabeth, but the babe in Elizabeths womb leaped for joy,</hi> doing homage, and paying adoration to his Lord, who was then in preſence. If <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her holy Babe thus rejoyced when Chriſt came under their Roof, how ſhould our Hearts leap within us, when the Son of God vouchſafes to come into the Secret of our Souls, not to viſit us for an hour, but to dwell with us, yea to dwell in us, and that for ever. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) How <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by an extraordinary Spirit of Prophecy, confirms what the Angel before had told the Holy Virgin. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>art thou among Women, and Bleſſed is the Fruit of thy Womb; and what an honour is this, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come to me?</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> How <hi>Elizabeth</hi> acknowledgeth the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in the perſon of the Mediator. She acknowledges Chriſt her <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> to be the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Son of God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, How the Virgin is pronounced <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> not ſo much for carrying Chriſt in her Womb by ſenſe, as for bearing him in her Heart by Faith; <hi>Bleſſed is ſhe that believed. Mary</hi> was not ſo Bleſſed in bringing forth Chriſt, as in Believing in him; yet the Believing here mentioned, I take to be her firm aſſent to the Meſſage which was brought her by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; as if <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had ſaid, Dumbneſs was inflicted on my Husband for his Unbelief of what the Angel ſaid, but <hi>Bleſſed art thou that didſt believe the Angel:</hi> My Husband a Man, an aged Man, a learned and eminent Man, a Prieſt of the moſt High God; and the Meſſage to him of more appearing poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet he disbelieved; But thou a Woman, a mean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Woman, of a private Condition, and the Meſſage brought moſt incredible, both to Nature and Reaſon, and yet is it believed by thee? <hi>Bleſſed therefore is ſhe that believed;</hi> and know, that as a Reward for thy Faith, <hi>all things ſhall certainly be performed that were foretold thee from the Lord: Learn</hi> hence (1.) It is the Property of God to do Great and Wonderful things. Our Faith muſt be Great, and our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation great; great Expectations from God, Honour the greatneſs of God. (3.) If our Faith be Great, God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances will be gracious and full. <hi>Bleſſed is ſhe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="46">46 And Mary ſaid, My ſoul doth magnify the Lord. 47 And my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour. 48 For he hath regarded the low eſtate of his hand-maiden, for behold from hence-forth all Generations ſhall call me Bleſſed. 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name. 50 And his mercy is on them that fear him throughout all generations. 51 He hath ſhewed ſtrength with his arm, he hath ſcattered the proud in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their hearts. 52 He hath put down the mighty from their Seats, and exalted them of low degree. 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath ſent emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty away. 54 He hath holpen his ſervant Iſrael, in remembrance of his mercy. 55 As he ſpake to our Fore-fathers, to Abraham, and to his ſeed for ever.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt Canticle, or Song of praiſe Recorded in the New Teſtament, compoſed by the Bleſſed Virgin with unſpeakable Joy, for deſigning her to be the Inſtrument of the Conception and Birth of the Saviour of the World: Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The manner of her Praiſe, her Soul and Spirit bear their part in the work of Thankſgiving, <hi>My Soul doth magnify, my Spirit hath rejoyced.</hi> As the ſweeteſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is made in the Belly of the Inſtrument, ſo the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful praiſe ariſes from the bottom of the Heart. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The object of her praiſe; ſhe doth not magnify her ſelf, but the Lord; yea, ſhe doth not Rejoice ſo much in her Son, as in <hi>her Saviour.</hi> Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That ſhe doth implicitly own and confeſs her ſelf a Sinner; for none need a Saviour but a Sinner: And (2.) by rejoycing in Chriſt as her Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſhe declares how ſhe valued her ſelf, rather by her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Relation to Chriſt as his Member, than by her natural Relation to him as his Mother; according to that of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Beatior Fuit Maria percipiendo Chriſti fidem: quam conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo Carnem:</hi> She might have been miſerable, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe bore him as her Son, had ſhe not Believed in him as her Saviour: therefore ſhe ſings, <hi>my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour. Obſ.</hi> (3.) How ſhe admires and magnifies God's peculiar favour towards her ſelf, in caſting an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Poverty and lowly Condition; that ſhe a poor, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Maid, unknown to the World, ſhould be lookt upon with an eye of Regard, by him that dwells in the higheſt Heavens. Where <hi>Note,</hi> That as God magnified her, ſhe magnified him, aſcribing all Honour and Glory to him that had thus dignified and exalted her, <hi>He that is mighty hath done for me great things, and glorified be his name. Obſ.</hi> (4.) She thankfully takes notice, that it was not only an high Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but a laſting Honour, which was conferred upon her, <hi>All Generations ſhall call me Bleſſed.</hi> She beholds an infinite laſting Honour prepared for her, as being the Mother of an
<pb facs="tcp:46556:79"/> Univerſal and Everlaſting Bleſſing, which all former Ages had deſired, and all ſucceeding Ages ſhould rejoyce in, and proclaim her Happy for being the Inſtrument of. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) How the Holy Virgin paſſes from the Conſideration of her Perſonal Priviledges to the univerſal Goodneſs of God; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that the Mercies and favours of God were not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and limited to her ſelf, <hi>but his mercy is on all them that fear him throughout all Generations.</hi> She declares the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Providence of God towards all Perſons, his mercy to the pious; <hi>his mercy is on all them that fear him;</hi> his juſtice on the proud; <hi>he has put down the mighty from their Seat, and ſcattered the proud in the imagination of their Hearts;</hi> his Bounty to the poor, he fills the hungry with good things. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, the excellency and advantagious uſefulneſs of the Grace of Humility, how good it is to be meek and lowly in Heart? This will render us lovely in God's Eye; and tho' the World trample upon us, he will exalt us to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves, and the envy of our deſpiſers. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, How ſhe magnifies the ſpecial Grace of God in our Redemption, <hi>he hath holpen his Servant Iſrael,</hi> that is, Bleſt them with a Saviour, who lived in the Faith, Hope, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the promiſed Meſſiah; and this Bleſſing ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares was (1.) the Reſult of Great Mercy, <hi>he remembring his mercy hath holpen his Servant Iſrael,</hi> (2.) The effect of his Truth and Faithfulneſs in his Promiſes; <hi>as he promiſed to our Fore-fathers Abraham and his Seed for ever. Learn</hi> thence, that the appearance of the promiſed Meſſiah in the Fulneſs of time; in order to the Redemption and Salvation of a loſt World, it was the Fruit of God's tender Love, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his Faithfulneſs in the promiſes made of Old to his Church and Children, <hi>he hath holpen his Servant Iſrael, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Mercy, as he ſpake to our Forefathers, to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and to his Seed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="56">56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own houſe. 57 Now Elizabeths full time came that ſhe ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and ſhe brought forth her Son. 58 And her neighbours, and her couſins heard, how the Lord had ſhewed great mercy upon her, and they rejoyced with her.</p>
               <p>Two things are here <hi>Obſervable</hi> (1.) The civil courteſy of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> towards her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> She ſtays with her three Months, probably till ſhe was Delivered and brought to Bed, not leaving her juſt at the time of her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, for the Angel told <hi>Mary, v.</hi> 36. That it was then the <hi>ſixth Month</hi> with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> after which <hi>Mary</hi> ſtays with her <hi>three Months,</hi> which made up the full time. To viſit and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our Friends in the time of their Diſtreſs, is not only an act of Civil Courteſy, but of Religion and Piety; not a Matter of Indifferency but of Duty. <hi>James</hi> 1.27. <hi>Pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and undefiled is this, to viſit in affliction,</hi> that is, this is an eminent act and exerciſe of Religion, the Evidence and fruit of Sincere Religion; and the Virgins doing this, was an act and inſtance of her Piety, as well as of her civil Courteſy. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Religious joy, and Spiritual rejoycing, which the Neighbours and Kindred expreſs at the lying in of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi> they did not meet together upon that great occaſion only to eat and drink, and make merry, <hi>but they rejoyced that the Lord had ſhewn great mercy upon her;</hi> oh how rarely is this Example followed in our Age! At the Delivery of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at the Birth of the Child, how little is God taken Notice of? How little is his power magnified, and his Goodneſs Celebrated in opening the Womb, in giving ſtrength to bring forth? And how rarely is this the Subject of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at the Woman's Labours; verily if the mercy of a Child, and the ſafe Delivery of the Mother, be not the firſt and principal things taken notice of at ſuch Rejoycing Meetings, they look more like Pagan then Chriſtian Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings.</p>
               <p n="59">59 And it came to paſs, that on the eighth day they came to circumciſe the child, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. 60 And his mother anſwered and ſaid, not ſo, but he ſhall be called John. 61 And they ſaid unto her, there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. 62 And they made ſigns to his Father, how he would have him cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and he asked for a writing Table, and wrote, ſaying, his name is John, and they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled all. 64 And his mouth was opened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and his tongue looſed, and he ſpake and praiſed God. 65 And fear came on all them that dwelt round about, and all theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were noiſed abroad, throughout all the Hill Country of Judea. 66 And all they that had heard them, laid them up in their hearts, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what manner of child ſhall this be? and the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Circumciſion of the Child at eight days old, according to the Commandment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where <hi>Note,</hi> Firſt, the Act <hi>Circumciſing,</hi> Secondly, the Time, <hi>at eight days old.</hi> God Commanded every Male Child to be Circumciſed, becauſe the Males by the Fore-skin propagate Sin, and convey Original Impurity. By this Ordinance God gave his People to underſtand the exceeding filthineſs of Sin, and that Man brings ſomething into the World with him, which ought preſently to be cut off. <hi>Note</hi> alſo, the time of Circumciſing the Child, <hi>at eight days old,</hi> not before, leaſt the Child ſhould be too weak to bear the pain; and muſt not be deferred longer, leaſt God interprets the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to be a Contempt of the Ordinance. Hence by the way we may <hi>Learn,</hi> that God did not tye Salvation to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sacrament, for if the Child had periſht, that dyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, it had been an hard thing to defer Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eight Hours. 'Tis not the want, but the Contempt and Neglect of the Sacraments that damns. <hi>It came to paſs on the eighth day they came to circumciſe the Child;</hi> we find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Ordinance appointed, and the time limited, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the perſon nor the place declared; <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Wife <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the Child, and that in an Inn, Ex.</hi> 4. A Duty is ſometimes poſitively injoined in the Scriptures, when the Circumſtances belonging to the Duty are undetermined. Thus the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper is appointed by Chriſt, but the time, the place, the geſture, not poſitively commanded, but to be prudentially determined, <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Name is given, or at leaſt declared at the time of the Child's Circumciſing, and that by its Parents, <hi>His Mother ſaid he, ſhall be called John.</hi> But how did his Mother know <hi>That,</hi> when her Husband was dumb? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis like her Husband <hi>Zachary</hi> had by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting informed his Wife concerning the whole Viſion, and what Name was impoſed upon him by the Angel; therefore ſhe ſays he ſhall be called <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> ratifies it, <hi>his name is John.</hi> The Nomination was originally from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, the Impoſition of the Name is now at Circumciſion from the Parents. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) How Ancient a Cuſtom it has been to give Names to Children according to the Names of their Fathers or Kindred. <hi>There is none of thy Kindred of this name,</hi> ſay they: The <hi>Jews</hi> made it a part of Religion, to give ſuitable Names to their Children, and ſignificant Names. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they either gave them Names to put them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God's Mercy to them, or of their Duty to him. Thus <hi>Zachary</hi> ſignifies <hi>the Remembrance of God;</hi> which name points at God's Mercy in remembring him, and his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in remembring God. Well then, is it uſual and uſeful for Parents to give ſignificant Names to their Children? then let Children have a Holy Ambition to make good the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their Names. Thus <hi>John</hi> ſignifies <hi>the Grace of God;</hi> but how will that Gracious Name riſe up in Judgment againſt that Child that is Graceleſs? <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) How <hi>Zachary</hi>'s Speech is immediately reſtored to him upon the naming of his Child. The Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 20. told him, <hi>he ſhould be dumb till the things he told him ſhould be performed;</hi> and now that they were performed, <hi>his Tongue is looſed, and he praiſes God,</hi> in a moſt Thankful manner. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) The effect which all this had upon the Neighbourhood; <hi>fear came upon all that dwelt round about them;</hi> that is, an awful and Religious fear of God, occaſioned by theſe miraculous operations; and <hi>they laid up theſe ſayings in their hearts,</hi> that is, conſidered of them, and pondered upon them: It argues a very vain Spirit and temper of Mind, when we paſs over the Obſervation of God's wonderful Acts with a ſlight Regard. The true Reaſon why we do ſo little admire the wonderful Works of God, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we conſider ſo little of them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (6.) The ſpecial
<pb facs="tcp:46556:79"/> favour vouchſafed by God to this Child <hi>John, The hand of the Lord was with him;</hi> that is, God was in a ſpecial manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, to direct and aſſiſt him, to protect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper him. The hand of God in Scripture ſignifies the help of God, the ſtrength and aſſiſtance of God. The hand of Man is a weak and impotent hand, a ſhort and ineffectual hand, but the hand of God is a ſtrong hand, an Almighty hand, able to aſſiſt and help, able to protect and preſerve: <hi>The hand of the Lord was with him;</hi> that is, the heart of God, and the help of God, the Love and Favour of God to ſupport him, and the Power and Providence of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and preſerve him. Lord, let our Hearts be with thee, and then thy Heart, and thy helping hand will be with us.</p>
               <p n="67">67 And his Father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and prophecied, ſaying, 68 Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people. 69 And hath raiſed up an horn of Salvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David. 70 As he ſpake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been ſince the world began. 71 That we ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our Enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us. 72 To perform the mercy promiſed to our fore-fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant. 73 The Oath which he ſware to our father Abraham. 74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear. 75 In holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life. 76 And thou child ſhalt be called the prophet of the Higheſt, for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his way. 77 To give know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Salvation unto his people, by the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſins. 78 Through the tender mercies of our God, whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us. 79 To give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet in the way of peace.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve (1.) That no ſooner was <hi>Zachary</hi> recovered and reſtored to his Speech, but he ſings the Praiſes of his Redeemer, and offers up a Thankſgiving to God: The beſt Return we can make to God for the uſe of our Tongue, for the giving or reſtoring of our Speech, is to publiſh our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's Praiſe, to plead his Cauſe, and vindicate his Honour. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) What it is that <hi>Zachary</hi> makes the ſubject matter of his Song? What is the particular and ſpecial Mercy which he praiſes and bleſſes God for? It is not for his own particular and private Mercy, namely, the Recovery of his Speech, tho' undoubtedly he was very thankful to God for that Mercy, but he Bleſſes and praiſes God for Catholick and Univerſal Mercies beſtowed upon his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: He doth not ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael that hath viſited me in Mercy, that hath once more looſed my Tongue, and reſtored my Speech: but <hi>Bleſſed be God that has viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> that it is both the Duty and Diſpoſition of a gracious Soul to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Praiſe and Thankfulneſs to God, more for Catholick and Univerſal Mercies towards the Church of God, then for any particular and private Mercies, how great ſoever towards himſelf. <hi>Bleſſed be God for viſiting and redeeming his people. Obſ.</hi> (3.) In this Evangelical Hymn, there is a Prophetical Prediction, both concerning Chriſt, and concerning <hi>John.</hi> Concerning Chriſt he declares, that God the Father had ſent him of his free mercy and rich Grace, yet in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Truth and Faithfulneſs, and according to his promiſe and Oath which he had made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) he bleſſes God for the Comprehenſive bleſſing of the Meſſiah, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael who hath viſited his people;</hi> namely, in his Son's Incarnation. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time made ſuch a viſit to this ſinful World, as Men and Angels admired at, and will admire to all Eternity. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) The ſpecial fruit and benefit of this gracious and merciful Viſitation, and that was the Redemption of a loſt World; <hi>he hath viſited and redeemed his People.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that miſerable Thraldom and Bondage which we were under to Sin and Satan, and expreſſes the ſtupendious Love of Chriſt, in buying our Lives with his deareſt Blood; and both by price and power reſcuing us out of the hands of our Spiritual Enemies. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) The Character given of This Saviour and Redeemer, he is <hi>an Horn of Salvation;</hi> that is, a Royal and Glorious, a Strong and powerful Saviour to his Church and people. The Horn in Scripture ſignifies Glory and Dignity, Strength and Power; as the Beauty, ſo the Strength of the Beaſt lies in its Horn. Now Chriſt being ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Horn of Salvation, intimates that he himſelf is a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Princely Saviour, and that the Salvation which he brings is great and plentiful, glorious and powerful; <hi>God has raiſed up an horn of Salvation for us in the houſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant David. Note</hi> (4.) The Nature and Quality of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Deliverance which the Son of God came to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh for us. Not a Temporal Deliverance, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but Spiritual, from the hands of Sin and Satan, Death and Hell; his Deſign was to purchaſe a Spiritual Freedom and Liberty for us, <hi>that we might be enabled to ſerve him without fear;</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſervile and offending fear of a Slave, but with the Dutiful and ingenuous fear of a Child; and this <hi>in holineſs and Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, in the Duties of the Firſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, <hi>all the days of our Life. Learn</hi> hence, That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who were Slaves of Satan, are by Chriſt made God's free Men. 2dly, That as ſuch they owe God a Service, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, chearful, and delightful Service, <hi>without fear;</hi> and a conſtant perſevering Service <hi>all the days of their Life,</hi> that <hi>we being delivered out of the hands of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Note</hi> (5.) The Source and Fountain from whence this Glorious Saviour, and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salvation did ariſe and ſpring, namely, from the mercy and faithfulneſs of God; <hi>To perform the mercy promiſed to our Forefathers, and to remember his holy Covenant, the Oath which he ſwear to our Father Abraham. Learn</hi> hence, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Mercy of Mercies, was graciouſly promiſed, and faithfully performed by God to his Church and People. Chriſt was a free and full Mercy, a ſuitable, a ſeaſonable, and a ſatisfying Mercy; an incomparable, unſearchable, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Mercy, which God graciouſly promiſed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Time, and faithfully performed in the fulneſs of Time. Thus far this Hymn of <hi>Zachary</hi> reſpects the Meſſiah. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) How he next turns himſelf to his Child, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning him; <hi>And thou Child ſhall be called the Prophet of the Higheſt,</hi> &amp;c. Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The Nature of his Office, <hi>thou ſhalt be a Prophet,</hi> not a common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one, but a Prophet of the higheſt Rank; the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lord of Hoſts. A Prophet thou ſhalt be, and more then a Prophet. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) As the nature of his Office, ſo the quality of his Work, <hi>Thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his way:</hi> Thou ſhalt be an Herald and Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the moſt High; thou ſhalt go before the Face of the Meſſias, and by thy ſevere Reproofs, and powerful Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhalt prepare his way before him, and make men fit and ready to receive this mighty Saviour. Thou Child ſhall be as the Morning Star, to foretel the Glorious ariſing of this Sun of Righteouſneſs. <hi>Learn</hi> hence (1.) That it is the higheſt Honour and Dignity to ſerve Chriſt in the quality and relation of a Prophet. (2.) That it is the Office and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Prophets of Chriſt, to prepare and make fit the Hearts of men to receive and embrace him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) That <hi>Zachary</hi> having ſpoken a few Words concerning his Son, he returns inſtantly to Celebrate the Praiſes of our Saviour, comparing him to the Riſing Sun, which ſhined forth in the Brightneſs of his Goſpel, to enlighten the dark corners of the World, <hi>thro' the tender mercies of our God, whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs. Learn</hi> here (1.) That Jeſus Chriſt is that true Son of Righteouſneſs, which in the fulneſs of Time did ſpring from on high, to viſit a loſt and undone World. (2.) That the great Errand of Chriſt's coming into the World, and the particular End of his Appearing in our Fleſh, it was <hi>to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs.</hi> (3.) That it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than infinite Mercy and bowels of Compaſſion in God and Chriſt, which inclined him to come from on high
<pb facs="tcp:46556:80"/> to viſit them that ſit in Darkneſs; <hi>Through the tender Bowels of Mercy in our God, whereby his own and only Son ſprung from on high to viſit us here below, who ſat in darkneſs and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death; and to guide our Feet into the way that leads to everlaſting peace.</hi>

               <p>The Concluſion of the former Chapter acquainted us with the Birth of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; the beginning of this Chapter relates the Birth of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and the remarkable Circumſtances which did attend it.

How remarkable the Providence of God was in bringing the Virgin up from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> that Chriſt (is it was Prophecy'd of him) might be Born there. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, to whom the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was now become Tributary, puts forth a Decree, that all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhould have their Names and Families Inrolled, in order to their being Taxed. This Edict required that every Family ſhould repair to that City to which they did belong, to be Enrolled and Taxed there. Accordingly <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> being of the Houſe and Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>David,</hi> have recourſe to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the City of <hi>David,</hi> where according to the Prophecy, the Meſſiah was Born. Here <hi>Note,</hi> How the Wiſdom of God over rules the Actions of Men, for higher and nobler Ends then what they aimed at. The Emperor's aim by this Edict was to fill his Coffers, God's End was to fulfil his Prophecies. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) How readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> yield Obedience to the Edict and Decree of this Heathen Emperour. It was no leſs then four days Journey from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> how juſt an Excuſe might the Virgin have pleaded for her abſence; What Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ever undertook ſo hazardous a Journey, that was ſo near her Delivery. And <hi>Joſeph</hi> no doubt was ſufficiently unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to draw her forth into ſo manifeſt a hazard. But as the Emperor's Command was peremptory, ſo their Obedience was exemplary. We muſt not plead difficulty for withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Obedience to Supreme Commands. How did our Bleſſed Saviour, even in the Womb of his Mother, yield Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to civil Rulers and Governours. The firſt Leſſon which Chriſt's example taught the World, was Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Supreme Magiſtrate. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) After many wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſteps, the Holy Virgin comes to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where every Houſe is taken up, by reaſon of the great confluence of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that came to be Taxed; and there is no room for Chriſt but in a Stable: The Stable is our Lord's Palace, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is his cradle. Oh how can we be abaſed low enough for him, that thus neglected himſelf for us; What an early indication was this, that our Lord's Kingdom was not of this World. Yet ſome obſerve a Myſtery in all this: an Inn is <hi>Domus publici Juris,</hi> not a private Houſe, but open and free for all Paſſengers, and the Stable is the commoneſt place in the Inn; to mind us, that he who was Born there, ſhould be a common Saviour to High and Low, Noble and Baſe, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, called therefore ſo often the Son of Man; the Deſign of his Birth being the Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And there were in the ſame country Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds abiding in the Field: keeping watch over their Flocks by night. 9 And lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them; and the Glory of the Lord ſhone round about them, and they were ſore afraid. 10 And the Angel ſaid unto them, fear not, for behold I bring you good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy, which ſhall be to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord. 12 And this ſhall be a ſign unto you: ye ſhall find a babe wrapped in ſwadling cloaths, lying in a Manger.</p>
               <p>Here we have the promulgation, and firſt publiſhing of our Saviour's Birth to the World. The Angel ſaid unto the Shepherd, I bring you glad Tidings, a Saviour is Born. Where <hi>Obſ.</hi> (1.) the Meſſengers imployed by God to publiſh the joyful News of a Saviour's Birth; the Holy Angels, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meſſengers imployed about an Heavenly Work: It is worth our Notice, how Serviceable the Angels were to Chriſt, upon all occaſions, when he was here upon Earth; an Angel declares his <hi>Conception,</hi> an Hoſt of Angels publiſh his Birth. In his <hi>Temptation,</hi> an Angel ſtrengthned him, in his <hi>Agony</hi> an Angel Comforts him: at his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel rolls away a Stone from the door of the Sepulchre. At his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> the Angels attend him up to Heaven, and at his <hi>Second coming to judge the World,</hi> he ſhall be Revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels. And great Reaſon there is that the Angels ſhould be thus officious in their Attendances upon Chriſt, who is an Head of Confirmation to them, as he was an Head of Redemption to fallen Man. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Perſons to whom this joyful Meſſage of a Saviour's Birth is firſt brought, and they are the Shepherds, <hi>the Angel ſaid unto the Shepherds fear not,</hi> (1.) Becauſe Chriſt the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of his Church was now come into the World; (2.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of old promiſed unto Shepherds, the old Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who by their occupation were Shepherds. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The time when theſe Shepherds
<pb facs="tcp:46556:80"/> had the Honour of this Revelation; it was not when they were aſleep on their Beds of Idleneſs and Sloth, <hi>but when they were lying abroad, and watching their Flocks.</hi> The Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Heaven uſually meet us in the way of an honeſt and induſtrious Diligence; whereas the idle are fit for nothing but Temptation to work upon. If theſe Shepherds had been ſnorting in their Beds, they had no more ſeen Angels, nor yet heard the News of a Saviour, then their Neighbours. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The nature and quality of the meſſage which the Angel brought, it was a <hi>meſſage of joy,</hi> a Meſſage of <hi>Great joy,</hi> a meſſage of <hi>great joy unto all people.</hi> For here was Born a Son, that Son a Prince, that Prince a Saviour, that Saviour not a particular Saviour of the Jews only, but an univerſal Saviour, whoſe <hi>Salvation is to the ends of the Earth.</hi> Well might the Angel call it a Meſſage or glad Tidings of Great Joy unto all People. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) The ground and occaſion of this joy, the foundation of all this good News which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the ears of a loſt World, and that was the Birth of a Saviour: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you is born this day in the City of David, a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That the Incarnation and Birth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation in our Fleſh and Nature, was and is matter of exceeding joy and rejoycing unto all People. (2.) That the Great End and Deſign of our Lord's Incarnation and Coming into the World, it was to be the Saviour of loſt Sinners; <hi>unto you is born a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Although the Birth of our Bleſſed Saviour was publiſhed by one Angel, yet is it Celebrated by an Hoſt of Angels, the whole Quire of Angels chaunt forth the Praiſes of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, upon this great and joyful Occaſion. Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) the Singers, (2.) the Song it ſelf. The Singers of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Anthem are the holy Angels, called <hi>an Hoſt,</hi> partly, for their number, partly for their Order where <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) The goodneſs and ſweet diſpoſition of theſe Bleſſed <hi>Spirits,</hi> in whoſe Boſoms that Cankered paſſion of Envy has no place; if it had, there was never ſuch an occaſion to ſtir it up, as now: But Heaven admits of no ſuch Paſſion; Envy is a Native of Hell, 'tis the ſmoke of the Bottomleſs Pit, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and temper of the Apoſtate ſpirits; theſe grieve at the Happineſs of Man, as much as the Angels rejoyce. O ye Bleſſed Angels, what did theſe Tidings concern you, that ruin'd Mankind ſhould be taken again into favour; whereas thoſe of your own Hoſt, which fell likewiſe, remained ſtill in that gulph of Perdition into which their Sin had plung'd them, without either hope of Mercy, or poſſibility of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. The leſs we repine at the Good, and the more we rejoyce at the Happineſs of others, the more like we are to the Holy Angels; yea, the more we reſemble God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Learn</hi> (2.) Did the Angels thus joy and rejoice for us? then what joy ought we to expreſs for our ſelves? Had we the Tongue of Angels, we could not ſufficiently chaunt forth the Praiſes of our Redeemer. Eternity it ſelf, it will be too ſhort to ſpend in the Rapturous Contemplation of Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Anthem, or Song it ſelf, which begins with a Doxology, <hi>Glory be to God in the Higheſt;</hi> that is, let God in the higheſt Heavens be glorified by the Angels that dwell on high. The Angelical Quire excite themſelves, and all the Hoſt of Angels, to give glory to God for theſe wonderful Tidings; as if they had ſaid, let the Power, the Wiſdom, the Goodneſs and Mercy of God, be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and revered by all the Hoſt of Heaven, for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Next to the Doxology follows a Gratulation: Glory be to God in the Higheſt, <hi>for there is peace on earth,</hi> and <hi>good will towards men.</hi> The Birth of Chriſt has brought a peace of Reconciliation betwixt GOD and Man upon Earth; and alſo a peace of amity and concord betwixt man and man, and is therefore to be Celebrated with Acclamations of joy.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And it came to paſs, as the Angels were gone away from them into Heaven, the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ſaid one to another, let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and ſee this thing which is come to paſs, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 16 And they came with haſte, and found Mary and Joſeph, and the babe lying in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 17 And when they had ſeen it, they made known abroad the ſaying, which was told them concerning this child. 18 And all they that heard it, wondered at thoſe things which were told them by the Shepherds. 19 But Mary kept all theſe things, and pondered them in her heart.</p>
               <p>Several particulars are here obſerveable, as (1.) That the Shepherds no ſooner hear the News of a Saviour, but they run to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to ſeek him: And tho' it was at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, yet they delayed not to go. Thoſe that leſt their Beds to attend their Flocks: now leave their Flocks to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after their Saviour. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That a gracious Soul no ſooner hears where Chriſt is, but inſtantly makes out after him, and judges no earthly Comfort too dear to be left and forſaken for him. Theſe Shepherds ſhew, That they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Saviour before their Sheep <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Theſe Shepherds having found Chriſt themſelves do make him known to others, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>When they had ſeen it, they made known abroad the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which was told them concerning this child. Learn,</hi> That ſuch as have found Chriſt to their comfort, and taſted that the Lord is Gracious themſelves, cannot but recommend him to the love and admiration of others. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) What effect this relation had upon the generality of people that heard it: It wrought in them amazement and aſtoniſhment, but not Faith: <hi>The people wondered,</hi> but not Believed. 'Tis not the hearing of Chriſt with the hearing of the Ear, nor the ſeeing of Chriſt with the ſight of the outward Eye; neither the hearing of his Doctrine, nor the ſight of his Miracles, will work divine Faith in the Soul, without the concurring Operation of the holy Spirit, the one may make us marvel, but the other makes us Believe; <hi>All that heard it, wondered at theſe things.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Note,</hi> The effect which theſe things had upon <hi>Mary,</hi> quite different from what they had upon the common people; <hi>they wondered, ſhe pondered;</hi> the things that affected their Heads, influenced her Heart, <hi>ſhe kept all theſe things, and pondered them in her heart.</hi>

There was no impurity in the Son of God, and yet is he Circumciſed, and Baptiſed alſo, tho' he had neither filth nor foreskin, which wanted either the Circumciſing Knife, or the Baptiſmal Water, yet he condeſcends to be both Circumciſed and Baptized; thereby ſhewing, that as he was made of a Woman, ſo he would be made under the Law, which he punctually obſerved to a tittle. And accordingly he was not only Circumciſed, but Circumciſed the eighth day, as the ceremonial Law required: and thus our Lord <hi>fulfilled all Righteouſneſs,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Name given at our Saviour's Circumciſion; <hi>his name was called Jeſus;</hi> that is, a Saviour, he being <hi>to ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. The great End of Chriſt's coming into the World, was to ſave Perſons from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power of their Sins. Had not he ſaved us from our Sins, we muſt have dyed in our Sins, and dyed for our Sins, and that Eternally. Never let us then ſit down de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding, either under the Guilt, or under the power of our Sins, and conclude, that they are either ſo great, that they cannot be forgiven, or ſo ſtrong, that they can never be overcome.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:46556:81"/>
               <p>A Twofold Act of Obedience doth the holy Virgin here perform to two Ceremonial Laws: The one concerning the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of Women after Child-birth, the other concerning the preſenting of the Male Child before the Lord. The Law concerning the purification of Women, we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. where the time mentioned for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Purification is ſet down; namely, after a Male Child forty days, after a Female, <hi>Fourſcore days;</hi> after which time ſhe was to bring a <hi>Lamb of a year old,</hi> for a Burnt-offering, in caſe ſhe was a perſon of ability; or <hi>a pair of Turtle-Doves,</hi> or <hi>two young Pidgeons,</hi> in caſe of extreme poverty. Now as to the Virgins Purification, <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) That no ſooner was ſhe able and allowed to walk, but ſhe Travels to the Temple. Where <hi>Note,</hi> That ſhe viſited God's Houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before her own houſe at <hi>Nazareth. Learn</hi> thence, that ſuch Women whom God has bleſt with ſafety of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, if they make not their firſt viſit to the Temple of God, to offer up their Praiſes of Thankſgivings there, they are Strangers to the Virgins Piety and Devotion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Another Act of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Obedience to the Ceremonial Law, <hi>ſhe preſented her Child at Jeruſalem to the Lord.</hi> But how durſt the Bleſſed Virgin carry her holy Babe to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Herod</hi>'s mouth? It was but a little before that <hi>Herod</hi> ſought the young Child's Life to deſtroy it; yet the Virgin ſticks not, in Obedience to the command of God, to carry him to <hi>Jeruſalem. Learn</hi> hence, That the apprehenſion of no dangers, either imminent or approaching, either at hand, or afar off, ought to hinder us from performing our Duty to Almighty God: we ought not to neglect a certain Duty, to eſcape an uncertain Danger. <hi>Obſerve</hi> further, as the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo the Humility of the Holy Virgin, in ſubmitting to the Law for purifying of Uncleanneſs: For thus ſhe might have pleaded; What need have I of purging, who did not conceive in Sin? Other Births are from men, but mine is from the Holy Ghoſt, who is purity it ſelf. Other Womens Children are under the Law, mine is above the Law; but like the Mother of him, whom it behoved to fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſhe dutifully fulfils the Law of God without quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling or diſputing. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, as the exemplary Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſo the great poverty of the Holy Virgin: ſhe has not a Lamb, but comes with her two Doves to God. Her Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declares her Penury. The Beſt are ſometimes the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſeldom the wealthieſt: yet none are ſo poor but God expects an Offering from them, he looks for ſomewhat from every one, not from every one alike. The Providence of God it is, that makes difference in perſons abilities, but his pleaſure will make no difference in the Acceptation. <hi>Where there is a willing mind it ſhall be accepted according to what a perſon hath,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And behold there was a man in Jeruſalem whoſe name was Simeon, and the ſame was juſt and devout, waiting for the conſolation of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the holy Ghoſt was upon him. 26 And it was revealed unto him by the holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould not ſee Death before he had ſeen the Lord's Chriſt. 27 And he came by the Spirit into the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jeſus, to do for him after the cuſtom of the law. 28 Then took he him up in his arms, and Bleſſed God, and ſaid.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was our Saviour brought into the Temple, and preſented to the Lord by his holy Parents, but in ſprings old <hi>Simeon,</hi> a pious and devout Man, who had a Revelation from God, that he ſhould not dye until he had with his bodily Eye ſeen the promiſed Meſſiah. Accordingly, <hi>he takes up the Child Jeſus in his arms,</hi> but hugs him faſter by his Faith then by his feeble Arms; and with Raviſhment of heart praiſes God for the Sight of his Saviour, whom he calls the <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Iſrael;</hi> that is, the Meſſiah, whom the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God had long look'd and waited for, and now took Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Conſolation in. <hi>Note</hi> here (1.) How God always performs his Promiſes to his Children, with wonderful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. <hi>Simeon</hi> had a Revelation that he ſhould not Dye until he had ſeen Chriſt; now he not only ſees him, but feels him too; he not only has him in his Eye, but holds him in his hands. Tho' God ſtays long before he fulfils his Promiſes, he certainly comes at laſt, with a double Reward for our expectation. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) That the Coming of the Meſſiah in the fulneſs of Time, and his appearing in our Fleſh and Nature, was and is matter of unſpeakable Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. And now that he is come, let us live by Faith upon him, as the Foundation of all Comfort and Conſolation both in Life and Death. Alas! what are all other Conſolations beſides this, and without this: They are impotent and inſufficient Conſolations, they are dying and periſhing Conſolations; nay they are ſometimes afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive and diſtreſſing Conſolations. The Bitterneſs accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, is ſometimes more than the Sweetneſs that is taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; but in Chriſt, who is the Conſolation of Iſrael, there is light without darkneſs, joy without ſorrow, all Conſolation, without any mixture of diſcomfort.</p>
               <p n="29">29 And he ſaid, Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, according to thy word, 30 For mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation. 31 Which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people. 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſrael. 33 And Joſeph and his mother marvelled at thoſe things which were ſpoken of him.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are a ſweet Canticle, or Swan-like Song of old <hi>Simeon,</hi> a little before his Diſſolution. He had ſeen the Meſſias before by Faith, now by ſight, and wiſhes to have his Eyes cloſed, that he might ſee nothing after this deſirable ſight. It is ſaid of ſome <hi>Turks,</hi> that after they have ſeen <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb, they put out their Eyes, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defile them after they have ſeen ſo glorious an Object: Thus old <hi>Simeon</hi> deſires to ſee no more of this World, after he had ſeen Chriſt the Saviour of the World; but ſues for his Diſmiſſion, <hi>Lord, let thy ſervant depart. Note</hi> here (1.) That a good Man having ſerved his Generation, and God in his Generation faithfully, is weary of the World, and willing to be diſmiſt from it. (2.) That the Death of a good man is nothing elſe but a quiet and peaceable departure; 'tis a departure <hi>in peace,</hi> to the <hi>God of peace.</hi> (3.) That it is only a ſpiritual ſight of Chriſt by Faith that can welcome the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Death, and render it an object deſirable to the Chriſtian's choice; he only that can ſay, <hi>My eyes have ſeen thy Salvation,</hi> will be able to ſay, <hi>Lord let thy Servant d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Sufferings of the Holy Jeſus on the Croſs, were as a Sword or dagger at the Heart of the Holy Virgin, and ſhe Suffered with him, both as a tender Mother, and as a Sympathizing Member of his Body.</p>
               <p n="36">36 And there was one Anna a propheteſs, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aſſer, ſhe was of a great Age, and had lived with an husband ſeven years from her Virginity. 37 And ſhe was a widow of about fourſcore and four years, which departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with faſtings and prayers, night and day. 38 And ſhe coming in at that inſtant gave thanks likewiſe unto the Lord, and ſpake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Iſrael.</p>

               <p>The Service of the Temple being ended, they return home to <hi>Nazareth;</hi> Religious Duties are not to be attended to the prejudice and neglect of our particular Callings.

Obſerve</hi> further, tho' <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> returned home, the Child Jeſus, unknown to them, ſtays behind. Their back was no ſooner turn'd upon the Temple, but his Face was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; Chriſt had Buſineſs in that place which his Parents knew not of. They miſſing him, <hi>ſeek him in the company,</hi> concluding him with their <hi>Kinsfolk and Acquaintance;</hi> from whence we may <hi>gather,</hi> that the Parents of Chriſt knew him to be of a ſweet and ſociable, of a free and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not of a ſullen and moroſe Diſpoſition. They did not ſuſpect him to be wandered into Fields or Deſerts; but when they miſt him, ſought him among their Kinsfolk: had he not wonted to converſe formerly with them, he had not now been ſought amongſt them. Our Bleſſed Saviour when on Earth, did not take pleaſure in a wild retiredneſs, in a froward auſterity, but in a mild affability and amiable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and herein alſo his Example is very inſtructive to us.</p>
               <p n="46">46 And it came to paſs, that after three days they found him in the temple, ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them queſtions. 47 And all that heard him were aſtoniſhed at his underſtanding and anſwers.</p>
               <p>At Twelve years old our Saviour diſputes in the Temple with the Doctors of the Law: Never had thoſe great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies heard the voice of ſuch a Tutor. Thus in our Saviour's Non-age, he gives us a proof of his Proficiency, even as the Springs ſhews us what we may hope for of the Tree in Summer. Our Saviour diſcovered his Accompliſhments by degrees; had his Perfections appeared all at once, they had rather dazled, then delighted the eyes of the Beholders; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the Sun would confound all eyes, ſhould it appear at its firſt Riſing in its full ſtrength. Chriſt could now have taught all thoſe great Rabbies the deep Myſteries of God, but being not yet called by his Father to be a publick Teacher, he contents himſelf to hear with Diligence, and to ask with Modeſty. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Parts and Abilities for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Function, are not ſufficient to warrant our Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it without a regular Call. Chriſt himſelf would not run, no not of his Heavenly Fathers Errand before he was ſent, much leſs ſhould we.</p>
               <p n="48">48 And when they ſaw him, they were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and his mother ſaid unto him, ſon, why haſt thou thus dealt with us? Behold thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I have ſought thee ſorrowing.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:82"/>
               <p>Without doubt it was impoſſible to expreſs the ſorrow of the holy Virgin's Soul, when all the ſearch of three days could bring them no tidings of their Holy Child. How did ſhe blame her Eyes for once looking off this Object of her Love, and ſpend both days and nights in a paſſionate bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Loſs. O Bleſſed Saviour, who can miſs Thee, and not mourn for Thee? Never any Soul conceived Thee by Faith, but was apprehenſive of thy worth, and ſenſible of thy want: What Comforts are we capable of, while we want Thee? and what reliſh can we taſte in any earthly Delight without Thee?</p>
               <p n="49">49 And he ſaid unto them, how is it that ye ſought me? wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my fathers buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, That Chriſt blames not his Parents for their ſollicitous care of him; but ſhews them how able he was to live without any dependency upon them and their care; and alſo to let them underſtand, that higher reſpects had called him away; that as he had meat to eat, ſo had he work to do, which they knew not of. For, ſays he, <hi>Wist ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers Buſineſs?</hi> as if he had ſaid, Altho' I owe reſpect to you as my natural Parent, yet my Duty to my Heavenly Father muſt be preferred. I am about his work, promoting his Glory, and propagating his Truth. We have alſo a Father in Heaven, oh how good is it to ſteal away from our earthly Diſtractions, that we may imploy our ſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in his Service; that when the World makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after us, we may ſay as our Saviour did before us, <hi>wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my fathers buſineſs?</hi>

               <p>The moſt material paſſage of our Saviour's Life, for the firſt twelve years, is here Recorded; namely, his diſputing with the Doctors in the Temple; how he ſpent the next eighteen years, namely, till he was Thirty, the Scripture doth not mention. It is here ſaid, that he lived with, and was Subject to his Parents; obeying their commands, and as it is believed, following their employments, working upon the Trade of a Carpenter, as was obſerved <hi>Mark</hi> 6.3. doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he did not live an idle Life; and why ſhould he that did not abhor the Virgins Womb, a Stable and a Manger, be ſuppoſed to abhor the works of an honeſt Vocation. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> farther, What a ſingular pattern is here for Children to imitate and follow in their Subjection to their Parents: If the greateſt and higheſt of mortals think themſelves above their Parents commands, our Saviour did not ſo, he pay'd Homage to the Womb that bare him, and to his ſuppoſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that provided for him. Let a perſon be never ſo high above others, he is ſtill below and inferiour to his Parents. Jeſus dwelt with his Parents, and <hi>was ſubject to them. Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, a farther Evidence of our Saviour's Humanity, with reſpect to his Humane Nature, which conſiſted of Body and Soul, he did Grow and improve, his Body in Stature, his Soul in Wiſdom; and he became every day a more eminent and illuſtrious Perſon in the eyes of all, <hi>being highly in favour both with God and man.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow leaving the Hiſtory of our bleſſed Saviour for eighteen years, namely, till he was thirty years old (the Holy Ghoſt having thought ſit to conceal that part of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's private Life from our knowledge) he begins this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a relation of the Baptiſt's Miniſtry, acquainting us with the time when, and the place where, and the Doctrine which the Baptiſt taught. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (1.) The time deſcribed when St. <hi>John</hi> began his publick Miniſtry; namely, when <hi>Tiberius</hi> was Emperour, and <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> High-prieſts; (1.) in the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when the Jews were intirely under the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſet four Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours over them called Tetrarchs, ſo named from their ruling over a fourth part of the Kingdom. From hence the Jews might have obſerved, had not prejudice blinded their Eyes, that the Scepter being thus departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>Shilo,</hi> or the Meſſias was now come. Again, the time when St. <hi>John</hi> began his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was, when <hi>Annas and Caiphas were High-prieſts,</hi> under the Law there were three ſorts of Miniſters that attended the Service of the Temple; namely, Prieſts, Levites, and Nethenims: over theſe the High-prieſt was chief, who, by God's command, was to be the firſt born of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family. But how came two High-prieſts here, ſeeing God never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but one at a time? In anſwer to this, ſay ſome, the power and covetouſneſs of the <hi>Romans</hi> put in High-prieſts at pleaſure to officiate for gain; ſay others, the High-prieſt was allowed his Aſſiſtant or Deputy, who in caſe of his pollution or ſickneſs did officiate in his place. But that which we may profitably obſerve from hence is this, The exactneſs and faithfulneſs of this Hiſtorian St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Circumſtances of our Saviour's Nativity, and the Baptiſts Miniſtry, that the Truth might evidently appear he is exact in Recording the Time.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And he came into all the country about Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, preaching the baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins. 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Iſaiah the prophet ſaying, the voice of one crying in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight. 5 Every valley ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and every mountain and hill ſhall be laid low, and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough way ſhall be made ſmooth. 6 And all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The place where the Baptiſt exerciſed his Miniſtry in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> where were ſome Cities and Villages, tho' thinly inhabited. <hi>Note</hi> here, the great Humility of the Baptiſt in preaching in an obſcure place, and to a ſmall handful of people: <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſome might think a fitter place for ſo celebrated a Preacher, but God had called him to preach in the Wilderneſs, and there he opens his Commiſſion. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of God's Miniſters muſt be content to execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and exerciſe their Miniſtry where God calls them, be the place never ſo mean and obſcure, and the people never ſo rude and barbarous. In the place where God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence fixes us, we muſt abide, till he that called us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, removes us thence. And this was the Baptiſt's caſe here. He leaves the Wilderneſs at God's command, and comes to more Inhabited places; <hi>he came into the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Jordan,</hi> preaching. It is not only lawful, but a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty for the Miniſters of God, to remove from one Place and People to another; provided their Call be clear, their way plain, the good of Souls their Motive, and the Glory of God their end. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Doctrine which the Baptiſt preached, namely, <hi>the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins;</hi> that is, the Doctrine of Baptiſm, which ſealeth Remiſſion of Sins to the party Baptized. <hi>Learn</hi> hence that the preaching of the Doctrine of Repentance, is the indiſpenſable Duty of every Goſpel-Miniſter; <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt preacht it, our Saviour preacht it, his Apoſtles preacht it; <hi>they went out every where preaching,</hi> that men ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: Till we are in a State of Sinleſs Perfection, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Repentance muſt be preacht unto us, and practiſed by us. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Motive and Inducement which prompted
<pb facs="tcp:46556:82"/> the Baptiſt to his Duty, which was to fulfil the Prophecies that went before of him, <hi>as it is written in the Book of the Prophets, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtreight; every valley ſhall be filled,</hi> &amp;c. Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The title given to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; a <hi>Voice,</hi> a crying voice. This implies both his vehemency and earneſtneſs, and alſo his freedom and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in delivering of his Meſſage; when a miniſter's own Heart is warmly affected with what he preach, he may hope to affect the Hearts of others. <hi>Note</hi> (2) The Sum and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he cryed, <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. that is, make your ſelves ready to receive the Meſſiah, to embrace and entertain his Doctrine. As loyal Subjects when their Prince is coming near their City, they remove every thing out of the way that may hinder his Progreſs; all Annoyances, and all Impediments. In like manner the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Work of the Goſpel upon the Hearts of Sinners, lies in pulling down Mountains, and filling up Valleys; that is, in humbling the proud Hearts of Sinners puft up (as the Phariſees were) with a conceit of their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who would be their own Saviours, and not beholding to Chriſt and his free Grace for Salvation. Learn hence (1.) That man's heart is naturally very unfit to receive and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Holy Doctrine; we have naturally no ſitneſs, no inclination, nor diſpoſition to believe in him, or ſubmit unto him. (2.) That if ever we deſire to entertain Chriſt in our Hearts, we muſt firſt prepare and make ready our Hearts for the receiving and embracing of him. For tho' <hi>the preparation of the heart be from the Lord,</hi> yet he requires the exerciſe of our Faculties, and the uſe of our Endeavours, he prepares our hearts by enabling us to prepare our own Hearts, by getting a ſight of the Evil of Sin, and a ſenſe of our Miſery without Chriſt; an hungring deſire after him, and a lively Faith in him. God does not work upon Man, as Maſons work upon Stone; what he doth in us and for us, he doth it by us, he works by ſetting us to work; therefore ſays the Holy Baptiſt, <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make,</hi> &amp;c. The Act of Endeavour is ours, the Aid and Aſſiſtance is God's. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, The encouragement which the Baptiſt gives to Perſons to prepare the way of the Lord; <hi>for</hi> (ſays he) <hi>all fleſh ſhall ſee the Salvation of God;</hi> that is, now is the time that all Perſons, Jew and Gentiles, may ſee the Author of Salvation, whom God has promiſed to the World, and may by Faith be made partakers of that Salvation which the Meſſiah ſhall purchaſe for them, and in his Goſpel tender to them. The great End of Chriſt's coming into the World, was to purchaſe Salvation for all Fleſh willing to be Saved by him.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Then ſaid he to the multitude, that came forth to be baptized of him; O generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come. 8 Bring forth therefore fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Repentance; and begin not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our father; for I ſay unto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> Ch. 3.7, 8. ſays, that the Baptiſt ſpake theſe words to the Phariſees and Sadduces, whom he gives firſt a quick and cutting compellation, <hi>oh Generation of Vipers,</hi> then a ſharp and ſevere Reprehenſion, <hi>who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> And laſt of all, a ſeaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance.</hi> As if he had ſaid, O ye Phariſees and worſt of Men, I perceive by your coming hither, ſome body has Alarm'd you with the Notices of that dreadful Vengeance that is coming upon this Generation, to prevent which you pretend Repentance of your Sins, but let me ſee by your Actions, that you are not only demure but ſincere Penitents; let me ſee the Fruits of your Repentance in the daily Courſe of your Converſations. <hi>Learn</hi> here (1.) That the Condition of proud Phariſees pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and falſe hearted Hypocrites, tho' very dangerous, yet is not hopeleſs and deſperate, and their Salvation, tho' the worſt of Men, muſt not be deſpaired of. St. <hi>John</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for their Sin, but yet encourages their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. (2.) That ſincere Repentance is not a barren thing, but does conſtantly bring forth Fruits anſwerable to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as Faith without Works, ſo Repentance without Fruits is dead alſo. The genuine Fruits of Repentance, are humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Heart, and holineſs of Life. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſtly, The cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Direction which he gives to theſe Hypocrites, not to reſt in their external Priviledges; <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves we have Abraham to our Father;</hi> glory not in this, that you are the only viſible Church that God has upon Earth; for God can out of the obdurate Gentile World raiſe up a People to himſelf, take them into Covenant with himſelf, and caſt you out. <hi>Learn</hi> hence (1.) That men are exceeding apt to boaſt of, and glory in their external Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and to place Religion moſt in thoſe things wherein God places it leaſt. How did the <hi>Jews</hi> Glory in their fleſhly deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> as if God were ty'd to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Line, and could have no People, if he had not them for his People. (2.) That it is a vain thing to expect exemption from the Judgments of God, becauſe of outward Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges enjoyed by God. If we be not born again of the Spirit, it will avail us nothing to be Born of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fleſh: If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Faith be not found in our Hearts, it will be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Blood is running in their Veins; <hi>Think not to ſay, we have Abraham to our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 And now alſo the Ax is laid unto the root of the trees, every tree therefore which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not forth good fruit, is hewen down, and caſt into the fire.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> having preacht the Doctrine of Repentance in the foregoing Verſes, he backs it with a powerful Argument in this Verſe, drawn from the certainty and ſeverity of that Judgment which would come upon them, if they continued in their ſins; <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root of the Tree. Learn</hi> (1.) That it is not unſuitable for Goſpel-preachers, to preſs Repentance and Holineſs of Life upon their Hearers, from Arguments of Terrour; <hi>John</hi> does it here, and Chriſt elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. (2.) That thoſe whoſe Hearts are not pierced with the Sword of God's Word, ſhall certainly be cut down and deſtroyed by the Ax of his Judgments. <hi>Obſerve</hi> further, that foraſmuch as the ſin here ſpecified is a Sin of Omiſſion, <hi>every Tree which bringeth not forth good fruit,</hi> as well as that which bringeth forth evil Fruit, <hi>is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</hi> We <hi>learn</hi> that Sins of Omiſſion are certainly damning, as well as Sins of Commiſſion. The neglects of Duty are as dangerous and damnable as the Acts of Sin. Such Trees as ſtand in God's Orchard the Church, and bring forth no good Fruit, are markt out as Fewel for the Devil's Fire.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the people asked him, ſaying, What ſhall we do then. 11 He anſwereth and ſaith unto them, he that hath two coats, let him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him that hath none, and he that hath meat let him do likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The Baptiſt having preſt his Hearers to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, here they inquire of him what Fruits they ſhould bring forth; he tells them firſt, the fruits of Charity and Mercy, <hi>he that hath two Coats, let him give to him that hath none.</hi> This is not to be underſtood ſtrictly, as if the Command required us to give the Cloaths off our Back, to every one that wanted them: But it directs thoſe that have the things of this Life in abundance, to diſtribute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to thoſe that are in want. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that an extenſive Liberality, and diffuſive Charity in diſtributing ſuch things as we can well ſpare, towards the Relief of others Neceſſities, is an excellent fruit of Repentance, and a good proof and evidence of the truth and ſincerity of it; <hi>Let him that hath two Coats, impart to him that hath none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 Then came alſo Publicans to be baptized, and ſaid unto him, maſter, What ſhall we do? 13 And he he ſaid unto them, exact no more then that which is appointed you.</p>
               <p>The Publicans were Perſons imployed by the <hi>Romans</hi> to gather the Tax or Tribute among the Jews, who were now Tributaries to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and paid them a publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. Theſe Publicans were great Oppreſſers, exacting more then was the Emperor's due, therefore we find Publicans and Sinners ſo often joyned together in the Goſpel.

That acts of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, as well as of Charity and Mercy, are real Fruits of ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) <hi>John</hi> doth not condemn the Office, but caution the Officer. If Magiſtrates may impoſe Taxes, they may doubtleſs appoint Officers to Collect thoſe Taxes: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity then muſt always teach us to diſtinguiſh betwixt Calling and the Crime. We muſt not Cenſure any Officer, either in Church or State, for the ſake of their Male-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, who are imploy'd in that Office.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And the Soldiers alſo demanded of him, ſaying, and what ſhall we do? and he ſaid unto them, do violence to no man, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any falſely, and be content with your Wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here what a general Reſort there was of all ſorts of Perſons to <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, Phariſees, Sadduces, Publicans, Soldiers; theſe laſt here inquire of him, what they ſhould do, to gain Acceptance with God? he anſwers, <hi>do no violence, defraud no man of his own</hi> by falſe Accuſation, but be content with the Allowance aſſigned for your Maintenance. Where it is (1.) ſtrongly ſuppoſed, that Soldiers are inſolent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, making no conſcience of injuſtice, falſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and violent Oppreſſion: yet (2.) the Office and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of a Soldier is not condemned, but regulated; he does not bid them caſt away their Arms, abandon War, appear no more as Military Men in the Field, but manage their Employment inoffenſively. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That in ſome Caſes, and under ſome Circumſtances, for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to make War is both lawful and neceſſary. To make a War Lawful, there is required a lawful Authority, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe, an honourable Aim and Intention, and a juſt and righteous manner of Proſecution, without Vanity and Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, without Cruelty and Oppreſſion; Courage and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the one hand, and Cowardiſe and Cruelty on the other hand, do frequently accompany one another.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men muſed in their hearts of John, whether he were the Chriſt, or not. 16 John anſwered, ſaying, unto them all, I indeed bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with water, but one mightier then I cometh, the latchet of whoſe ſhoes I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to unloſe, he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire. 17 whoſe fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his Wheat into his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but the chaff he will burn with Fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How the extraordinarineſs of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts Perſon, the earneſtneſs of his Preaching, the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of his Doctrine, and the Exemplarineſs of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, drew all Perſons to an Admiration of him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they began to think within themſelves, whether he were not the Meſſias himſelf. He plainly tells them he was not, but only his Servant, his Harbinger, and Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The high Opinion which <hi>John</hi> had of Chriſt, <hi>he is mightier than I;</hi> that is, a Perſon of greater Authority, Dignity, and Excellency than my ſelf: From whence may be <hi>gathered,</hi> that tho' Chriſt was man, he was more then Man, even very God, equal with the Father; for <hi>John</hi> himſelf was the greateſt of them that were born of Women. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.11. yet ſays <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt is mightier then I. How ſo? but in regard of the Dignity of his Perſon, being both God and Man, <hi>he that cometh after me is mightier then I. Obſ.</hi> (3.) The humble and low Eſtimation that the Holy Baptiſt had of himſelf, <hi>his Shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloſe;</hi> a Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial Speech, implying that he was unworthy to do the loweſt Offices, and meaneſt Services for Chriſt: Lord, how well does humility of Mind, an humble Apprehenſion, and a low opinion of themſelves, become the Meſſengers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> was a Man of eminent Abilities, yet of exemplary Humility; he thought himſelf unworthy to unloſe Chriſt's Shoe. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) <hi>John</hi> does not only declare the Dignity of Chriſt's Perſon, but the Excellency of his Office; <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I only waſh the Body with water, but Chriſt cleanſes the Soul by the operation of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is as fire in the effects of it, purifying the hearts of his People from Sin, and conſuming their Luſts and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; yet at the ſame time having fiery Indignation, and flaming Judgments, to deſtroy and burn up impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners like dry Stubble. Obſervable it is in Scripture, that Chriſt is repreſented by one and the ſame Metaphor of fire, in a way of Comfort to his Children, and in a way of Terror to his Enemies, he is a fire unto Both. He ſits in the hearts of his people as a Refiners fire; he is amongſt his Enemies as a Conſuming fire; a fire for his Church to take Comfort in, a fire for his Enemies to periſh by. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, how the Holy Baptiſt compares our Saviour to an Husbandman, and the Jewiſh Church to a Barn floor; the office of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to threſh, fan and winnow his Corn, ſeparating it from the Chaff, preſerving the one and conſuming the other. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) That the Church is Chriſt's floor, (2.) That this Floor Chriſt will purge, and that thoroughly. (3.) That the Word of Chriſt is the Fan in his hand, by and with which he will thoroughly purge his Floor. The Church is compared to a Floor upon the account of that Mixture which is in the Church. In a Floor, there is Straw, as well as Grain, Chaff as well as Corn, Tares as well as Wheat, Cockel and Darnel as well as good Seed: Thus in the Church there has been, there is, and ever will be, a mixture of good and bad, Saints and Sinners, Hypocrites and Sincere Chriſtians; but this floor Chriſt will purge, purge it but not break it up; purge out its Corruptions, but not deſtroy its Eſſence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: And the Fan in Chriſt's hand, with which he will purge his Floor, is his Holy word, accompanied with the wing of Diſcipline. The Fan detects and diſcovers the Chaff, and the Wing diſſipates and ſcatters it, and by the help of both the Floor is purged; <hi>his Fan is in hand, and he will thoroughly purge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And many other things in his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preached he unto the people. 19 But Herod the Tetrarch being reproved by him for Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his brother Philips wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done. 20 Added yet this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, that he ſhut up John in priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) In <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt the character of a zealous and faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel, he is one that deals plainly, and durſt tell the Greateſt Perſons of their Faults. <hi>Herod,</hi> tho' a King, is reproved by him for his Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Inceſt. The Crown and Scepter of <hi>Herod</hi> could not daunt the faithful Meſſenger of God. There ought to meet in the Miniſters of Chriſt both courage and impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; courage in fearing no faces, and impartiality in ſparing no ſins. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Who it was that Impriſoned and Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Holy Baptiſt; <hi>Herod</hi> a King: How ſad is it, when Kings who ſhould be nurſing Fathers to the Church, do prove the bloody Butchers of the Prophets of God. The ſevereſt Perſecutions which the Miniſters of God have fallen under, have been occaſioned by their telling great Men of their Crimes; Men in power are impatient of Reproof, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that their Authority gives them a Licenſe to tranſgreſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The heinous aggravations of this Sin in <hi>Herod, He added this to all his other Sins, that he ſhut up John in priſon.</hi> This evidenced him incorrigible and unreclaimable. <hi>John</hi> had preacht before <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> had heard <hi>John</hi> with ſome Delight, but he had a darling luſt which occaſioned his Deſtruction. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, that Hypocrites may hear the word with ſome pleaſure, and do many things with ſome delight, but they have always ſome beloved Luſt that muſt be ſpared, they will neither part with it, nor bear Reproof for it. <hi>Herod</hi> ſticks not to cut off that Head, whoſe Tongue was ſo bold to reprove him for his Luſts.</p>

That thereby he might fulfil the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ceremonial Law, which required the waſhing of the Prieſts in Water, before they entered upon their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) How the Duty of Prayer accompanieth the Ordinance of Baptiſm; <hi>Jeſus being Baptized and Praying: Teaching</hi> us by his example to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy every Ordinance and every Action with Prayer; Chriſt when he was Baptized, he Prayed, when he was Tempted he Prayed, when he brake Bread he Prayed, when he wrought Miracles he Prayed, in his Agony in the Garden he prayed, when he Suffered on the Croſs he Prayed; what was the ſubject matter of our Lord's Prayer at this time is not expreſt, but by what followed, namely, the Heavens opening, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcending, it is probably conjectured, that he prayed for ſome Teſtimony to be given from Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf; for it immediately follows,</p>
               <p n="22">22 And the Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſhape, like a dove upon him, and a voice came from Heaven, which ſaid, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, the ſolemn inveſting of Chriſt into his Office as Mediator, is attended with a threefold Miracle, namely, the opening of the Heavens, the Deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, and God the Father's voice concerning his Son; <hi>the Heavens were opened,</hi> to ſhew, that Heaven which was cloſed and ſhut againſt us for our Sins, is now opened to us, by Chriſt's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for us: <hi>Next, the Holy Ghoſt deſcends like a Dove</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour; here we have a proof and evidence of the Bleſſed Trinity; the Father ſpeaks from Heaven, the Son comes out of the Water, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcends in the likeneſs of a Dove. But why did the Holy Ghoſt now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon Chriſt? firſt for the Deſignation of his Perſon, to ſhew that he was the Perſon ſet apart for the Work and Office of a Mediator. Secondly, for the Unction and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his Perſon for the performance of that Office: Now was he anointed to be the King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church. Laſtly, we have here <hi>the voice of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> pronouncing (1.) The nearneſs of Chriſt's Relation; <hi>This is my Son;</hi> (2.) The endearedneſs of his Perſon; This is my <hi>Beloved</hi> Son; (3.) The fruit and benefit of this near Relation unto us, <hi>In thee I am well pleaſed.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That there is no poſſibility for any Perſon to pleaſe God out of Chriſt; neither our Perſons, nor our Performances can find Acceptance with God, but only in and through him, and for his ſake. (2.) That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the ground and cauſe of all that Love and Good Will which God the Father ſheweth to the Sons of Men. <hi>In Chriſt,</hi> God is well pleaſed with us as a Reconciled Father, out of him a conſuming Fire; <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleaſed.</hi>

               <p n="23">23 And Jeſus himſelf began to be about thirty years of age, being, (as was ſuppoſed) the ſon of Joſeph, which was the ſon of Eli.</p>
               <p>At Thirty years of Age, the Prieſts under the Law, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon their publick Office; accordingly Chriſt ſtays the full time preſcribed by the Law, before he undertakes his publick Miniſtry; and he gives the reaſon for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. <hi>that he might fulfil all Rightouſneſs;</hi> that is, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the ceremonial Law, which required Perſons to be of that Age before they entered that Office; and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them to be Baptized or waſht in Water, when they undertook their Office.

               <p>We find the Genealogy of our Bleſſed Saviour Recorded by two Evangeliſts, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke:</hi> his Pedegree is ſet forth by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> from his Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by St. <hi>Luke</hi> from his Mother <hi>Mary;</hi> the deſign of both is to prove him lineally deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true and promiſed Meſſias; St. <hi>Matthew</hi> intending his Hiſtory primarily for the Jews, proves him to be the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> for their comfort: St. <hi>Luke</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the information and comfort of the Gentiles, derives our Lord's Pedigree from <hi>Adam,</hi> the common Parent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to aſſure the Gentiles of their poſſibility of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, they being Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> Neither of theſe Evangeliſts are ſtrict and accurate in enumerating every individual perſon; which ſhould <hi>Teach</hi> us not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious in ſcanning the parts of this Genealogy, much leſs captiouſly to object againſt it, becauſe of ſome ſeeming

Let us rather attend the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt in Writing of it, which was Twofold, (1.) for the honour of our Saviour, as Man, ſhewing who were his Noble and Royal Progenitors, according to the Fleſh. (2.) For the confirmation of our Faith, touching the Reality of our Saviour's Incarnation; the Scripture making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his Progenitors from the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> to his Reputed Father <hi>Joſeph;</hi> we cannot reaſonably doubt either of the truth of his humane Nature, or of the certainty of his being the promiſed Meſſias. Hence we may <hi>Learn,</hi> That the wiſdom of God has taken all neceſſary care, and uſed all needful Means for ſatisfying the minds of all unprejudiced Perſons, touching the Reality of Chriſt's humane Nature, and the certainty of his being the promiſed Meſſias; for both theſe Ends is our Saviour's Genealogy, Deſcent and Pedigree, Recorded in Holy Scripture.</p>

               <p n="1">1 AND Jeſus being full of the Holy Ghoſt returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>At the 22 Verſe of the foregoing Chapter, we find the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt deſcending in a bodily Shape, like a Dove upon our Saviour; in this verſe we find the extraordinary effects and fruits of the Holy Ghoſt's Deſcent upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he was filled with all the Gifts and Graces of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, to fit and furniſh him for that miniſterial Service which he was now entring upon. But obſervable it is, that before our Saviour undertook the miniſterial Office, <hi>he is led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs,</hi> and there furiouſly aſſaulted with Satan's Temptations; Temptation, Meditation and Prayer, ſays <hi>Luther,</hi> make a Miniſter; great Temptations from Satan, do fit us for greater Services for God. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt was led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil;</hi> by the Spirit we muſt underſtand the Holy Spirit of God; for the Devil (I think) is never called the Spirit, but has always a brand of Reproach annext, as the evil Spirit, the unclean Spirit, and the like: By his <hi>being led by the Spirit,</hi> (St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays, <hi>he was drove by the Spirit</hi>) we muſt not underſtand any violent motion, but a potent and efficacious perſwaſion, he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a ſtrong impulſe of the Spirit of God, or as the Learned <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks, Chriſt was bodily caught up by the Holy Spirit into the Air, and carried from <hi>Jordan,</hi> where he was Baptized into the Wilderneſs, where he was tempted. God had put Great honour upon Chriſt at his Baptiſm, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to be his well-beloved Son, in whom he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and the next News we hear, is the Devil's aſſaulting him with his Temptations. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, that the more any are beloved of God, and dignified with more eminent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Favour, ſo much the more is the Devil enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and maliciouſly bent againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Being forty days tempted of the Devil, and in thoſe days he did eat nothing, and when they were ended, he afterward hungred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here how the Divine Power upheld Chriſt's humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without Food; What <hi>Moſes</hi> did at the giving of the Law, Chriſt doth at the beginning of the Goſpel; namely, <hi>Faſt forty days, and forty nights:</hi> Chriſt hereby intended our Admiration, rather than our imitation; or if our Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the Action only, not of the Time. From this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt we <hi>Learn,</hi> that it is our Duty by faſting and Prayer, to prepare our ſelves for a Conflict with our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Enemies, as Chriſt prepared himſelf by faſting to grapple with the Tempter, ſo ſhould we.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And the Devil ſaid unto him, if thou be the ſon of God, command this ſtone, that it be made Bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here (1.) The occaſion of the Temptation, and (2.) the Temptation it ſelf; The occaſion of the Temptation was our Saviour's hunger and want of Bread. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That when God ſuffers any of his Children to fall into want, and to be ſtraightned for outward things, Satan takes a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty advantage thereupon, to tempt and aſſault them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) What Sin it is he tempts our Saviour to, it is the ſin of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, to call in queſtion his Sonſhip; <hi>if thou be the Son of God,</hi> and then to diſtruſt God's Providence and care, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that theſe Stones be made Bread:</hi> It is the grand poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Satan, firſt to tempt the Children of God to doubt of their Adoption, next to diſtruſt God's fatherly care and proviſion, and laſt of all to uſe unwarrantable means to help themſelves. Thus Satan dealt with Chriſt, and thus he deals with Chriſtians; for to work a Miracle at Satans Direction, was not a lawful means of providing food for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And Jeſus anſwered him, ſaying, It is written that man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> firſt, That tho' the Devil abuſed Scripture, yet Chriſt uſes it. Good things are never the worſe for being abuſed by Satan, and his Inſtruments. <hi>Note</hi> Secondly, the weapon which our Saviour made uſe of to vanquiſh Satan; it was the word of God: <hi>it is written,</hi> ſays Chriſt. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the Scripture, or the written word of God is the only ſure Weapon wherewith to vanquiſh Satan, and beat back all his fiery Temptations. The Scripture is God's Armory, out of which all our Weapons of War muſt be taken for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging our Conflict with Sin and Satan.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And the Devil taking him up into an high mountain, ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the Devil ſaid unto him, all this power will I give thee, and the glory of them, for this is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me, and to whomſoever I will I give it. 7 If thou therefore wilt worſhip me, all ſhall be thine. 8 And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Get thee behind me Satan, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</p>
               <p>The next Sin which Satan tempts our Saviour to, is the Sin of Idolatry, even to worſhip the Devil himſelf; Oh thou impudent and foul Spirit, to deſire thy Creator to Worſhip thee, an Apoſtate Creature: Doubtleſs there is no ſin ſo black and foul, ſo horrid and monſtrous, but the Chriſtian may be tempted to it, when Chriſt himſelf was tempted to Worſhip the Tempter, even the Devil himſelf; St. <hi>Matthew</hi> reads it, <hi>If thou wilt Worſhip me,</hi> St. <hi>Luke, If thou wilt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before me;</hi> from whence we may gather, that if to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before the Devil, be to worſhip the Devil, then to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before an Image, is to worſhip the Image. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) the Bait which Satan makes uſe of to allure our Saviour to the ſin of Idolatry, repreſenting to his eye and view all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the World in a moſt inviting manner, and that in a moment of time, that ſo he might affect him the more, and prevail the ſooner. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the Pomp and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the World is made uſe of by Satan, as a dangerous Snare to draw Men into a compliance with him in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations unto ſin, <hi>He ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the world,</hi> and the Glory of them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) What an impudent Lyar and proud Boaſter the Devil is, he was a Lyar from the beginning; <hi>All this will I give thee, for it was delivered unto me,</hi> an impudent untruth, for the Dominion over the things of the World was never given to the Angels; neither has the Devil any power over the Creatures, but by permiſſion from God. The Devil is a moſt impudent Lyar, he told the firſt Lye, and by long Practice is become a perfect Maſter in the Art of Lying. <hi>Obſerve</hi> alſo, the Devil's Boaſting as well as Lying, <hi>All this, will I give thee,</hi> when he had not one foot of Ground to diſpoſe of. Great Boaſters are for the moſt part great Lyars, and ſuch Boaſters and Lyars are like the Devil. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) How our Saviour declares the true and only Object of Religious Worſhip, namely, God himſelf; <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Religious Worſhip is to be given to none of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, neither to Angels nor Men, how excellent ſoever, but to God alone: We read but of two Creatures that ever deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scripture to be Worſhipped with Divine Worſhip, namely, the Devil and Antichriſt; but the command is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord, and him only.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:84"/>9 And he brought him to Jeruſalem, and ſet him upon a pinacle of the temple, and ſaid unto him; If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down from hence: 10 For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee. 11 And in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone. 12 And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto him, it is ſaid, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 13 And when the Devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a Seaſon.</p>
               <p>Obſerve here (1.) The power which Satan, by God's permiſſion, had over the Body of our Bleſſed Saviour; He took him up, and he carried his Body through the Air, from the Wilderneſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there ſets him upon one of the Pinacles of the Temple. <hi>Learn</hi> hence (1.) That Satan by God's permiſſion may have a power over the Bodies of Men, yea, over the Bodies of the beſt of Men. (2.) That this exerciſe of Satans power over the Bodies of Men, is no Argument that ſuch Perſons do not belong to God. Our Saviour himſelf, who was dear to God, is yet left for a time in Satans hands. But tho' Satan had a power to ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pinacle of the Temple, yet he had no power to caſt him down; tho' Satan's Malice be infinite, his power is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bounded; he cannot do all the miſchief he would, and he ſhall not do all he can. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Sin which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan tempts Chriſt to, the ſin of Self-murther, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down. Learn,</hi> that Self-murther is a ſin which Chriſt himſelf was, and the Beſt of his Children may be ſollicited and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to; yet tho' Satan ſollicited Chriſt to the ſin, he could not compel him to comply with the Temptation. Thence <hi>Note,</hi> That how much earneſtneſs and importunity ſoever Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan uſes in preſſing his Temptation, he can only perſwade, he cannot compel; he may entice, but cannot enforce. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (3.) The Argument which Satan uſes to perſwade Chriſt to the ſin of Self-murther, it is a Scripture-Argument; he quotes a Promiſe, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee;</hi> What a wonder is here, to ſee the Devil with a Bible under his Arm, and with a Text of Scripture in his Mouth? Chriſt had alledged Scripture before to Satan; here Satan Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts Scripture back again to Chriſt: <hi>It is written,</hi> ſays Chriſt, it is written ſays Satan. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan knows how to abuſe the moſt excellent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Scriptures, to the moſt horrid and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ends and Purpoſes; He that had Prophanely toucht the Sacred Body of Chriſt with his hand, ſticks not preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to handle the Holy Scriptures with his Tongue. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Text of Scripture which Satan makes uſe of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee;</hi> where the Doctrine is good, but the Application bad: The Doctrine is true, that God is pleaſed to imploy his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for the good of his Servants, and particularly for their preſervation in times of Danger. But ſee how falſely the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil perverts, miſapplies, and wreſts that Sacred Scripture: When God promiſes that his Angels ſhall keep us, it is <hi>in all his ways,</hi> not in our own crooked paths. <hi>Learn,</hi> That altho' the Children of God have the promiſe of the Guardianſhip of his Holy Angels, yet then only may they expect their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, when walking in the way of their Duty: <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The iſſue of this Combat, Satan is vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and departs from our Saviour. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil left him, and Angels came and miniſtred unto him;</hi> Satan is Conquered and qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="14">14 And Jeſus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the Region round about, 15 And he taught in their Synagogues, being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of all. 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and as his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and ſtood up for to read. 17 And there was delivered unto him the Book of the Prophet Eſaias, and when he had opened the Book, he found the place where it was written. 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted: to preach deliverance to the Captives, and Recovering of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed. 19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. 20 And he cloſed the Book, and gave it again to the Miniſter, and ſate down, and the eyes of all them that were in the Synagogue were faſtned upon him. 21 And he began to ſay unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being thus fitted and prepared by his Baptiſm and Temptations for the Execution of his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office, he now enters upon the great work of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> here declares the firſt place he preacht at, namely, <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and the firſt Text he preacht upon. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The place which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our preacht at; he beſtowed his firſt Sermon upon <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> the place of his Conception and Education: For tho' Chriſt was Born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> yet he was bred and brought up at <hi>Nazareth;</hi> there he had his poor, but painful Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, working on his Father's Trade, that of a Carpenter; This prejudiced the Jews againſt him, who lookt for a Scepter, not an Ax, in the hand of him that was born King of the Jews. Our Saviour's ſhort and ſecret abode at <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> and his long and publick living at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> occaſioned him to be called <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth:</hi> Yet ſome conceive it was a Nick-name faſtned by the Devil upon our Saviour, that he might diſguiſe the place of Chriſt's Nativity, and leave the Jews at the greater loſs concerning their Meſſiah. Sure it is, that this Name <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> ſtuck upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour all his Life; and at his Death was fixed by <hi>Pilate</hi> on his Croſs. Yea, after his Aſcention, ſuch as believed on him were called <hi>The Sect of the Nazareens,</hi> or <hi>the followers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Nazareth. Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Text which our Saviour preacht upon at <hi>Nazareth;</hi> he takes it out of the Prophet <hi>Eſaias,</hi> Ch. 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath Anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor;</hi> that is, God the Father hath poured forth his Holy Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon me, in all the Gifts and Graces of it, to ſit and furniſh me for the work of a Mediator; and particularly, <hi>to preach the Goſpel to the poor</hi> in Spirit, and to ſuch as are poor in outward Condition alſo, if meekned and humbled with the ſight and ſenſe of their ſins; <hi>To bind up the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that is, to comfort them with the glad tidings of the Goſpel, <hi>To preach Deliverance to the Captives;</hi> to let ſuch Sinners know, who were ſlaves to ſin and Satan, that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer is come, if they be willing to be Delivered by him, <hi>To preach the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> or to proclaim a Spiritual Jubilee, in which God proffers pardon of Sin and Reconciliation with himſelf upon the Terms of the Goſpel; <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That God ſtirreth up none to take upon them the Office of the Miniſtry, whom he hath not fitted and furniſhed with Gifts for the Regular diſcharge of it. (2.) That Chriſt himſelf did not undertake the Office of a Mediator, but by the Ordination of God the Holy Spirit, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath ſent me to preach the Goſpel.</hi> (3.) That no Creature, Angel or Man, could perform the Office of a Mediator, but only Chriſt, who was Conſecrated to that Office by an Anointing from the Holy Spirit without meaſure; <hi>The Spirit of the Lord</hi> hath anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.

That the preaching of the Goſpel is the great Ordinance, which Chriſt himſelf made uſe of, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his Apoſtles and Miniſters, for inlightning blind Sinners, for comforting broken hearts, and for Delivering Captive Souls from the ſlavery and dominion of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; <hi>He hath ſent me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to publiſh Deliverance to the Captives, and

The Behaviour of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Auditors, (the Men of <hi>Nazareth</hi>) under his Preaching; their Eyes were fixt, and their minds intent upon him, and upon what was ſpoken by him, <hi>The Eyes of all that were in the Synag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O that our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers would imitate our Saviour's Hearers under the Word: They faſtned their Eyes upon him, as if they meant to hear with their eyes as well as with their Ears: And yet we have cauſe to ſuſpect, that Curioſity rather than Piety cauſed this their Attention, ſeeing as you will find, <hi>v.</hi> 29. That theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſons, who out of Novelty were ready to eat his words, ſoon after, out of Cruelty were ready to devour the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; <hi>for they thruſt him out of the city, led him to the Brow of the Hill, and would have caſt him down headlong:</hi> Oh bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour! What wonder is it, that the Perſons of thy Miniſters are deſpiſed, and their Doctrine neglected, when thou thy ſelf, the firſt Preacher of the Goſpel, and for thy firſt Sermon at <hi>Nazareth</hi> wert thus ignominiouſly treated.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And all bare him witneſs, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth: and they ſaid, is not this Joſeph's ſon? 23 And he ſaid unto them, ye will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay unto me this Proverb, Phyſician heal thy ſelf: Whatſoever we have heard done in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, do alſo here in thy country. 24 And he ſaid, verily I ſay unto you, no Prophet is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in his own country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The effect of our Saviour's Miniſtry at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> it created wonder, but did not produce Faith; they marvelled, but not believed; they admire the Wiſdom of his Diſcourſes, but will not own him to be the promiſed Meſſias, becauſe of the Poverty and Meanneſs of his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Is not this Joſeph's Son?</hi> They expect the ſon of a Prince, not the ſon of a Carpenter to be their Meſſiah. Thence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Poverty and Meaneſs of Chriſt's Condition, was that which Multitudes ſtumbled at, and which kept many, yea moſt from Believing on him. None but a Spiritual Eye can diſcern Beauty in an humbled and abaſed Saviour. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) Our Saviour wonders not, that ſo few of his Country men, amongſt whom he had been bred and brought up, and with whom he had lived moſt part of his time, did deſpiſe his Perſon, and reject his Doctrine: He tells them, <hi>No Prophet has honour in his own Country;</hi> that is, very ſeldom has; <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> us, that uſually the Miniſters of God are moſt deſpiſed, where they are moſt familiarly known; ſometimes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their mean Original and Extraction, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the poverty of their Parents, ſometimes the Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their Childhood, ſometimes the follies of their youth, ſometimes the faults of their Family and Relations, are ript up, and made occaſions of Contempt; and therefore that Prophet that comes from afar, and has not been much known gains the greateſt Reputation amongſt a people, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of his Extraction, look upon his Breeding as well as his Calling to be Divine. This good uſe ought to be made of our Saviour's Obſervation, that his Miniſters be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe and diſcreet in Converſation with their People, not making themſelves cheap and common in every Company, nor light and vain in any Company: for ſuch Familiarity will breed contempt, both of their Perſons and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But our Duty is, by ſtrictneſs and gravity of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to keep up an awe and eſteem in the Conſciences of our People; always tempering our Gravity with Courteſy, and a Condeſcending Affability, that Miniſter which proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes his Authority, fruſtrates the end of his Miniſtry, and is the occaſion of his own Contempt.</p>
               <p n="25">25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Iſrael in the days of Elias, when the heavens were ſhut up three years and ſix months, when great Famine was throughout all the Land. 26 But unto none of them was Elias ſent, ſave unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. 27 And many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were in Iſrael in the time of Elizeas the Prophet, and none of them was cleanſed, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Naaman the Syrian.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour by a double inſtance, confirms what he had laſt told his Country-men at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> namely, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are moſt deſpiſed by their own Country men and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and that Strangers oft-times have more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by a Prophet than his own People. The firſt inſtance of this which our Saviour gives them is in the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> tho' there were many Widows then in his own Nation, yet none of them were qualified to receive his Miracles, but a Stranger, <hi>a Widow of Sareptha.</hi> The ſecond inſtance was in the days of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> when tho' there were many Lepers in and about his Neighbourhood, yet they being his Country-men deſpiſed him; and none were qualified for a Cure but <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> a man of another Country. Thus the Prophets of God, like ſome Fiſhermen, catch leaſt in their own Pond, and do more good by their Miniſtry among ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then amongſt their own Country-men, Kinsfolk, and near Relations; <hi>No Prophet is accepted in his own Country.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The horrid Impiety of the People of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> in thruſting their Saviour out of their City, and their barbarous and bloody Cruelty in bringing him to the Brow of the Hill, with full intent to caſt him down headlong. But Chriſt was to dye a clean contrary way, not by throwing down, but by lifting up. Oh ungrateful and unhappy <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is this the Return you make that Divine Gueſt, which for Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years had ſojourned in your Coaſts? No wonder that the ableſt Preaching, and moſt exemplary Living of the Holieſt and beſt of Chriſt's Miniſters obtain no greater ſucceſs at this day amongſt a people; when the preſence of Chriſt at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> for thirty Years together, had no better influence upon the Minds and Manners of that People; but inſtead of Receiving his Meſſage, they rage at the Meſſenger: Neither let any of the Miniſters of Chriſt think it ſtrange, that they are ignominiouſly deſpiſed, when our Maſter before us, was in danger of being barbarouſly Murthered, and that for his plain Preaching to his own People, the Men of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> But <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The miraculous eſcape of our Bleſſed Lord from the murdering hands of the wicked <hi>Nazarites; he paſſing through the midſt of them went his way:</hi> How and after what manner he eſcaped, is not declared, and therefore cannot without preſumption be determined. Altho' the Rhemiſts to make way for their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that contrary to the nature of a Body, he penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thorough the Breaſts of the People. But whether he ſtruck them with Blindneſs that they did not ſee, or ſmote them with fear that they durſt not hold him; or whether by a greater ſtrength then theirs (which his Godhead could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſupply his Humane Nature with) he eſcaped from them, it is neither prudent to inquire, nor poſſible to determine; we know it was an eaſy thing for him, who was God as well as Man, to quit himſelf of any Mortal Enemies; and at the ſame time, when he reſcued himſelf, could have ruin'd them, by frowning them into Hell, or looking them into nothing.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days. 32 And they were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine, for his word was with power. 33 And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a
<pb facs="tcp:46556:85"/> Spirit of an unclean Devil, and he cryed out with a loud voice. 34. Saying, let us alone, What have we to do with thee, thou Jeſus of Nazareth? art thou come to deſtroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God. 35 And Jeſus rebuked him, ſaying, hold thy peace, and come out of him: and when the Devil had thrown him in the midſt, he came out of him, and hurt him not. 36 And they were all amazed, and ſpake among themſelves, ſaying, what a word is this? for with Authority and power, he commandeth the unclean ſpirits, and they come out. 37 And the ſame of him went out into every place of the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being driven out of <hi>Nazareth</hi> by the fury of his Country-men, departs to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into their Synagogues, and taught. Who can declare the pains that our Saviour took, and the hazards which he ran in preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel to loſt Sinners; But obſerve the ſmalneſs of his Succeſs; the People were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but not believed; his Doctrine produced Admiration, but not faith; his Auditors were Admirers, but not Believers, the People were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine; the reaſon of which Aſtoniſhment is added, <hi>for his word was with power;</hi> that is, there was Majeſty in his Perſon, Spirituality in his Preaching, and powerful Miracles accompanying both, and confirming Both, of which the Evangeliſt here gives us an account, namely, the caſting out of a Devil in one poſſeſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>There was a man which had a Spirit of an unclean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and he cryed out;</hi> that is, the Devil that unclean Spirit did enter into him and bodily poſſeſs him. Amongſt many other Calamities which ſin has brought upon our Bodies, this is one, to be Bodily poſſeſt by Satan. The Devil has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Malice againſt Mankind, ſeeking to ruine our Souls by his Suggeſtions and Temptations; and to deſtroy our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by ſome means or other. Oh how much is it our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as well as our Duty, by Prayer to put our ſelves, morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening under the Divine care and Protection, that we may be preſerved from the power and malice of Evil Spirits. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The Title here given to the Devil, he is called the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit.</hi> The Devils, thoſe wicked Spirits of Hell, are moſt impure and filthy Creatures; impure by reaſon of their original Apoſtacy, impure by means of their actual and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sins; ſuch are Murder, Malice, Lying and the like, by which they continually pollute themſelves; and impure, by means of their continual deſire and endeavours to pollute Mankind with the Contagion of their own ſins. Lord! how foul is the nature of Sin, which makes the Devil ſuch a foul and filthy, ſuch an impure and unclean Creature. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Subſtance of the Devil's out-cry, <hi>Let us alone, What have we to do with thee? art thou come to deſtroy us?</hi> that is, to reſtrain us from the exerciſe of our power; the Devil thinks himſelf deſtroyed, when he is reſtrained from doing Miſchief. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Title given by the Devil to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he ſtiles him, <hi>The Holy one of God:</hi> How comes this Acknowledgment out of the Devil's Mouth? could an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle make a Profeſſion beyond this: but how comes Satan to make it? for no good end, and with no good intention we may be ſure, for the Devil never ſpeaks Truth for Truth-ſake, but for advantage-ſake: probably (1.) he might make this Profeſſion, that ſo he might bring the Truth profeſt into queſtion: hoping that a Truth which received Teſtimony from the Father of Lies, would be ſuſpected: or (2.) it might perhaps be done to make the People believe that our Saviour had ſome familiarity with Satan, and did work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by his help, becauſe he did confeſs him, and ſeem to put honour upon him: Hence we may <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is poſſible, for a Perſon to own and acknowledge Chriſt to be the True and Only Saviour, and yet to miſs of Salvation by him: If a Speculative Knowledge, and a verbal Profeſſion of Chriſt were ſufficient to Salvation, the Devil himſelf would not miſs of Happineſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) How our Saviour rebukes the Devil for this Confeſſion, and commands him Silence: <hi>Jeſus rebuked him ſaying, hold thy peace.</hi> But why was this Rebuke given the Devil, and his Mouth ſtopt when he ſpake the Truth? <hi>Anſwer</hi> (1.) Becauſe Chriſt knew that the Devil confeſt this Truth on purpoſe to Diſgrace the Truth. (2.) Becauſe the Devil was no fit Perſon to make this Profeſſion: a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Truth from the father of Lies, is enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Truth it ſelf ſuſpected. Yet the Devil's Evidence that Chriſt was the Holy One of God, will riſe up in Judgment againſt the wicked Phariſees, who ſhut their Eyes againſt the Miracles, and ſtopt their Ears againſt the Doctrine of the Holy One of God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> laſtly, How the unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit obeys the voice of Chriſt, but with great Reluctancy and Regret; when the unclean Spirit had thrown him in the midſt, he came out. Where <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The Devil's ſpite at parting, he tares the Man, throws him violently from place to place, ſhewing, how loth he was to be diſpoſſeſſed. Where Satan has once gotten an hold, and ſettled himſelf for a time, how unwilling is he to be caſt out of Poſſeſſion. Yea, it is a Torment and vexation to him to be caſt out. It is much eaſier to keep Satan out, then to caſt him out. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan may poſſeſs the Body by God's Permiſſion, but he cannot poſſeſs our Hearts without our own Conſent and Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it will be our Wiſdom to deny him Entrance into our Souls at firſt, by Rejecting his wicked Motions and Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for when once entered, he will like the ſtrong Man Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, keep the Houſe, till a ſtronger then he caſts him out.</p>
               <p n="38">38 And he aroſe out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons houſe, and Simons wives mother lay ſick of a fever, and they beſought him for her. 39 And he ſtood over her and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the fever, and it left her, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhe aroſe and miniſtred unto them.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) That St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a Diſciple, yea, an Apoſtle, was a Married Perſon: Neither the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, nor the Apoſtles of the New, did abhor the Marriage-Bed, nor judge themſelves too pure for an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their Maker. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by denying the Lawfulneſs of Prieſt's Marriage, makes her ſelf wiſer then God, who ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Marriage is Honourable amongſt All men. Obſerve</hi> (2.) <hi>Peter,</hi> tho a Good Man, and his Wifes Mother, probably a Gracious Woman, yet is his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited with Sickneſs. Strength of Grace, and Dearneſs of Reſpect even from Chriſt himſelf, cannot prevail againſt Diſeaſes. God's own Children are viſited with Bodily Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as others. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Divine Power of Chriſt manifeſted in this miraculous Cure; <hi>He ſtood over her,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Luke, he took her by the hand and lift her up,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Mark:</hi> Here was an ordinary Diſtemper cured after an extraordinary manner, by a touch of Chriſt's hand, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; <hi>Immediately the Fever left her, and ſhe aroſe and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto them.</hi> That ſhe could ariſe, argued her Cure Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; that ſhe could and did ariſe, and adminiſter to Chriſt and his Diſciples, argued her Thankfulneſs. After Chriſt had healed any of us, it ought to be our firſt care to Adminiſter unto him; that is, to employ our Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Strength in the Service of Chriſt, and to improve our Reſtored Health to the Honour and Glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="40">40 Now when the ſun was ſetting, all they that had any ſick with divers diſeaſes, brought them unto him: and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 41 And Devils al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo came out of many, crying out and ſaying, Thou art Chriſt the ſon of God: and he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, and ſuffered them not to ſpeak, for they knew that he was Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt here declares ſundry other Cures wrought by our Saviour, he healed the Sick, and diſpoſſeſſed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. In our Saviour's time we read of many poſſeſſed with Devils, and but of few, either before or afterward. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably (1.) Becauſe Satan perceiving the Meſſiah to be come in the Fleſh to deſtroy his Kingdom, did rage the more, and diſcover greater Malice and Enmity againſt Mankind. (2.) Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Almighty God ſuffered Satan at that time to poſſeſs ſo many, that Chriſt might have occaſion to manifeſt his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, by caſting Satan out. And accordingly we find our Saviour diſpoſſeſſing all that were poſſeſt by Satan.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:86"/> It is added, <hi>That he ſuffered not the Devils to ſpeak, becauſe they knew him;</hi> that is, Chriſt would not be made known to be the Son of God by the Preaching of the Devil, leſt the World ſhould from thence take occaſion to think, that our Saviour held a Correſpondency with thoſe wicked Spirits, and that the Miracles which he wrought were performed by the Devil's Aſſiſtance, as being one in Combination with him. Poſſibly from the Devil's owning Chriſt to be the Holy one of God, the Phariſees concluded that there was a compact and agreement betwixt them: and thereupon their Affirmation was Grounded, <hi>he caſteth out Devils, by Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub the Prince of Devils.</hi>

               <p>Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) That our Saviour uſed the Sea as well as the Land in his paſſage from place to place, to preach the Goſpel; and the reaſons why he did ſo, might probably be theſe, (1.) to ſhew Natures intent in making of the Sea, namely, to be Sailed upon, as the Land to be walked upon. (2.) That Chriſt might take occaſion to manifeſt his Deity, in working Miracles upon the Sea; namely, by calming of the Waves, and ſtilling of the Winds. (3.) It might be to comfort Sea-faring men in their Diſtreſſes, and to encourage them to pray to ſuch a Saviour as had an experimental Knowledge of the Dangers of the Sea; it were well if Sailers would conſider this, and inſtead of inuring themſelves to the Language of Hell, when they go down into the deeps, would direct their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto Chriſt, and look up to him; who now in Heaven has the remembrance of what he himſelf indured and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent here on Earth, and on the Sea. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time when Chriſt uſed to put forth to Sea; it was uſually after he had wrought ſome extraordinary Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which ſet them on admiring and commending of him; as after he had fed ſo many thouſands with a few Barley-Loaves and Fiſhes, preſently he put forth to Sea, ſhunning thereby all popularity and vain-glorious Applauſe from the Multitude, which he was never ambitious of, but induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avoided. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) That after our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, we never find him Sailing any more upon the Seas. For ſuch a Fluctuating and Turbulent Condition, which neceſſarily attends Sea-Voyages, was utterly inconſiſtent with the conſtancy, ſtability and perpetuity of Chriſt's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate when Riſen from the Grave. The firm Land better agreeing with his fixed State; he keeps upon it, till his Aſcenſion into Heaven. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) That Chriſt ſcruples not to preach to the People in, and out of the Ship, <hi>he ſate down, and taught the people out of the Ship:</hi> Sometimes we find our Holy Lord preaching upon a Mountain, ſometimes in a Ship, ſometimes in an Houſe, as often as may be in the Synagogue: He that laid hold on all Seaſons for Preaching the Goſpel, never ſcrupled any place which conveniency of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to preach in; well knowing, that it is the Ordinance that Sanctifies the place, and not the Place the Ordinance.</p>

If they Fiſh with brokeh Nets, either deliver unſound Doctrine, or lead unexemplary Lives, <hi>if they do not caſt the Net on the right ſide of the Ship,</hi> that is, rightly divide the word, as Workmen that need not to be aſhamed. And if they do not fiſh at Chriſt's Command, but run a fiſhing unſent, it is then no wonder, that they La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all their days and catch nothing. But very often is it the Fiſhes Fault, rather than the Fiſher-mans. Worldly men are crafty and cunning, they will not come near the Net. Hypocrites are ſlippery like Eels, the Fiſherman cannot long hold them, but they dart into their holes; priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their external Performances, and ſatisfying themſelves with a round of Duties. The great men of the World break thro' the Net, the Divine Commands cannot bind them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.5. <hi>I will go to the great men, and ſpeak to them, but they have broken the yoke, and burſt the bonds. Obſ.</hi> (3.) The miraculous Succeſs which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had, when at Chriſt's Command he let down the Net; <hi>They incloſed ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb facs="tcp:46556:86"/> of Fiſhes that their Net brake.</hi> Two things our Saviour aimed at in this Miracle, (1.) To manifeſt to his Diſciples the power of his Godhead, that they might not be offended at the poverty and meanneſs of his Manhood. (2.) To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of the great Succeſs which his Apoſtles and their Succeſſors might expect in planting and propagating of the Goſpel. If the Miniſters of Chriſt, whom he calls Fiſhers of Men, be Faithful in the caſt, his Power ſhall be magnified in the Draught. Some of our Fiſh will cleave Eternally to the Rocks, others play upon the Sands, more will wallow in the Mud, and continue all their days in the filth of ſin, if our Maſter, at whoſe Command we let down the Net, doth not incloſe them in it, as well as aſſiſt us in the caſting of it. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) What influence the ſight of this Miracle had upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it occaſioned fear, and amazement, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to adore Chriſt, and declare himſelf unworthy of his preſence. <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful Man, O Lord;</hi> not that the good man was weary of Chriſt's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but acknowledged himſelf unworthy of it. 'Tis a great Diſcovery of our Holineſs to revere God and fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, when he doth wonderful things before us, tho' they be wonders of Love and Mercy; here was a wonderful appearance of Chriſt's Power and Mercy to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But it affects him with reverential fear and awful Aſtoniſhment. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) How St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles at Chriſt's Call, forſook all and followed him; they left Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Friends, Ship and Nets, and followed Jeſus; whom Chriſt Calls, he calls effectually; he draws whom, he calls, and works their Hearts to a ready Compliance with their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And altho' when they were firſt called to be Diſciples, they followed their Trades of Fiſhing for a time, yet upon their ſecond call to the Apoſtleſhip, they left off their Trade, and forſook all to follow the Miniſtry. Teaching the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that it is their Duty to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly up to their great Work, and not to incumber themſelves with ſecular Affairs and worldly Buſineſs: nothing but an indiſpenſible Neceſſity in providing for a Family, can excuſe a Miniſters incumbring himſelf with Worldly Concerns and Buſineſs: <hi>They forſook all, and followed Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) the Petitioner, that in a very humble and ſubmiſſive manner ſues unto Chriſt for Cure and Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>A Leper fell on his Face, and beſought him, ſaying, Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean:</hi> he doth not queſtion Chriſt's Power, but diſtruſts his willingneſs to help and heal him. Chriſt's Divine Power muſt be fully aſſented to, and firmly Believed by all thoſe that expect benefit by him, and healing from him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) The great readineſs of Chriſt to help and heal this diſtreſſed Perſon; <hi>Jeſus touching him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will, be thou clean.</hi> By the Ceremonial Law, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was forbidden to be touched, therefore Chriſt's touching this Leper, ſhews himſelf to be above the Law; that he was the Lord of it, and might diſpenſe with it; and his healing this Leper by the word of his Mouth, and the touch of his Hand, ſhewed him to be truly and really God; for Leproſy among the Jews was accounted an incurable Diſtemper, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Finger of God; a Diſeaſe of his ſending, and of his removing. Our Saviour therefore, as a proof of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſias, tells <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5. <hi>That the Lepers were cleanſed, and the Dead raiſed by him;</hi> which two being joined together do imply, that the cleanſing of the Lepers is as much an act of Divine Power, as the raiſing of the Dead; and accordingly, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.8. it is ſaid, <hi>Am I God that this man ſends unto me to cure a perſon of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy. Obſ.</hi> (3.) The certainty and ſuddenneſs of the Cure, was a farther proof of Chriſt's Divine Power, <hi>Immediately the Leproſy departed.</hi> Chriſt not only Cured him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but inſtantaneouſly; not only without Means, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ordinary time required for ſuch a Cure. Thus Chriſt ſhewed both Power and will to Cure him Miraculouſly, who Believed his Power, but queſtioned his willingneſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) A Twofold Charge and Command given by Chriſt to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (1.) To tell it to no Man: where the great Modeſty, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Humility of Our Saviour is diſcovered, together with the prudent care he took of his own Safety; his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in concealing his own Praiſes, his Humility in ſhunning all vain-glorious Applauſe and Commendation; his Piety in referring all the Honour and Glory to God his Father; and the Care of his own Safety appeared, leſt the publiſhing of his Miracles ſhould create untimely Danger from the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees. (2.) The next part of the Charge given to the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Leper, is to go and ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt, and to offer the Gift which <hi>Moſes</hi> Commanded for a Teſtimony unto them; that is, to teſtify to the Jews, that he did not oppoſe the Ceremonial Law which required a Thank-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Hand; and alſo that the Miracle might teſtify, that he was the true and promiſed Meſſiah. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that our Bleſſed Saviour would have the Ceremonial Law pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerved, ſo long as the time for its continuance did endure; tho' he came to deſtroy that Law, yet whilſt it ſtood, he would have it exactly obſerved.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And he withdrew himſelf into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and prayed.</p>
               <p>The Duty of private and ſolitary Prayer is not more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injoined by our Saviour's Command, then it is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by his Example. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Duty which our Holy Lord performed, <hi>Prayer;</hi> we have much more buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God in Prayer, than Chriſt had; he had no ſins to be humbled for, nor beg pardon of; no need to pray for any ſanctifying habits of Grace, the Holy Spirit being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him without meaſure; yet did our Holy Lord ſpend much of his time in Prayer; he took delight in paying this Homage to his Heavenly Father. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) What kind of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er our Lord did eminently delight in, it was <hi>ſolitary and private</hi> Prayer. He often went alone, even out of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his own Diſciples. The Company of our Beſt friends is not always ſeaſonable nor acceptable. There are Times and Seaſons when a Chriſtian would not be willing that his Deareſt Relations upon Earth ſhould hear that Intercourſe which paſſes betwixt him and his God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The place our Lord withdraws to for private Prayer; it is <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert;</hi> he withdrew into the Wilderneſs and Prayed, both to avoid Oſtentation, and alſo to enjoy Communion with his Father. The modeſt Bridegroom of his Church, ſays St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> will not impart himſelf ſo freely to his Spouſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Company, <hi>St. Mark</hi> 1.35. adds, <hi>That our Saviour roſe up a great while before day, and went into this deſert place to pray; Teaching</hi> us, that the Morning is the fit Seaſon, yea, the beſt of Seaſons for private Duties; now are our Spirits freſheſt, and our minds freeſt, before the Diſtractions of the day break in upon us: It is certainly much better to go from Prayer to buſineſs, then from buſineſs to Prayer. <hi>Note</hi> laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Bleſſed Saviour had no idle hours here in the World, his time did not lye upon his hand as ours do; he was always either Preaching or Praying, or working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; either paying Homage to God, or doing good to man. Lord! help us to imitate this thy inſtructive Example, by imbracing all opportunities of Glorifying God, and doing good to one another.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And it came to paſs on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Phariſees and Doctors of the Law ſitting by, which were come out of every Town of Galilee, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and Jeruſalem: and the power of the Lord was preſent to heal them. 18 And behold men brought in a Bed, a man which was taken with the palſey, and they ſought means to
<pb facs="tcp:46556:87"/> bring him in, and to lay him before them. 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, becauſe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they went upon the houſe-top, and let him down through the Tiling, with his Couch, into the midſt, before Jeſus. 20 And when he ſaw their faith, he ſaid unto him, Man, thy ſins are forgiven thee. 21 And the Scribes and the Phariſees began to reaſon, ſaying, Who is this which ſpeaketh Blaſphemies? who can forgive Sins, but God alone? 22 But when Jeſus perceived their thoughts, he anſwering, ſaid unto them, what reaſon ye in your hearts? 23 Whither is eaſier to ſay, Thy ſins be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee? or to ſay, Riſe up and walk? 24 But that ye may know, that the ſon of man hath power on earth to forgive Sins, (he ſaid unto the ſick of the Palſy) I ſay unto thee Ariſe, and take up thy Couch, and go into thy houſe. 25 And immediately he roſe up, before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own houſe, glorifying God. 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, ſaying, We have ſeen ſtrange things this day.</p>
               <p>As the great End of our Saviours Miracles was to confirm his Doctrine, ſo commonly after his Preaching he wrought his Miracles: The Scribes and Phariſees, tho' they had no love for our Saviour's perſon, nor value for his Miniſtry, yet they frequently accompanied him wherever he went, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cavil at his Doctrine, and partly out of Curioſity to ſee his Miracles; but <hi>Obſerve</hi> the gracious Condeſcenſion of our Saviour, altho' he well knew that the Phariſees at this time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon him with no good intention, yet he puts forth his Divine Power in working Miracles before them; <hi>the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord was preſent to heal;</hi> Not that Chriſt's Power was at any time abſent, but it is ſaid now to be preſent, becauſe it was now exerted and put forth at his Will and Pleaſure. And accordingly at this time, before the Phariſees Eyes, he Miraculouſly Cures a Perſon ſick of the Palſy, as the Paragraph before us does inform us. Wherein <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Diſeaſed and Diſtreſſed Perſon, <hi>one ſick of the Palſy,</hi> which being a Reſolution and weakneſs of the Nerves, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebles the Joynts, and confines a Perſon to his Bed or Couch. As a Demonſtration of Chriſt's Divine Power, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſingle out the Palſy and Leproſy, incurable Diſeaſes to work a Cure upon. Now this Perſon was ſo great a Cripple, by reaſon of the Palſy, that he could not go, nor be led, but was carried in his Bed or Couch. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) As the grievouſneſs of the Diſeaſe, ſo the greatneſs of the Peoples Faith. The Man and his friends had a firm and full perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Chriſt was cloathed with a Divine Power, and able to help him; and they hope in his Goodneſs, that he was willing as well as able. And accordingly the Roof of the Jewiſh Houſes being flat they uncover ſome part of it, and let the Bed down, with the ſick Man in it, and lay him at the foot of Chriſt, in hopes of help and healing. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) That no ſooner did they exerciſe their Faith in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but Chriſt exerts his Divine Power in healing; yet the Object of their Faith, probably was not Chriſt's Divine Power as God, but they look upon him as an extraordinary Prophet, to whom God had Communicated ſuch a Divine power as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> had before him. Yet ſee the marvellous efficacy even of this Faith, which obtained not only what was deſired, but more then was expected. They deſired only the healing of the Body, but Chriſt heals Body and Soul too; <hi>ſaying, Son, be of good chear, thy ſins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee;</hi> Thereby our Saviour ſignifies to them, that ſin is the meritorious Cauſe of Sickneſs, and conſequently that in Sickneſs the beſt way to find eaſe and deliverance from pain, is firſt to ſeek for pardon; for the ſenſe of pardon will in ſome degree take away the ſenſe of pain. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) The Exception which the Phariſees take againſt our Saviour for pronouncing that this Man's Sins were forgiven him; they charge him with Blaſphemy, urging that it is God's peculiar Prerogative to pardon ſin; indeed their propoſition was true, but their application was falſe. Nothing more true, then that it is the higheſt Blaſphemy for any meer Man to arrogate and aſſume to himſelf the incommunicable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, abſolutely and authoritatively to forgive ſin. But then their denying this power to Chriſt of Forgiving ſins, which he had as God from all Eternity, and as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, GOD and Man in one Perſon, when here on Earth; this was Blaſphemy in them; but the aſſuming and challenging of it none in him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) To Cure, if poſſible, the obſtinacy and blindneſs of the Phariſees, our Saviour gives them a Two-fold Demonſtration of his Godhead, (1.) By letting them underſtand, that he knew their thoughts; <hi>Jeſus perceived their thoughts, v.</hi> 22. to know the thoughts, to ſearch the Hearts, and underſtand the reaſonings of Men, is not in the power of Angels or Men, but the Prerogative of God only. (2.) By aſſuming to himſelf a power to forgive Sins, for our Saviour here, by taking upon him to forgive ſins in his own name, and by his own Authority, doth give the World an undeniable proof, and convincing Evidence of his Godhead; <hi>For who can forgive Sins, but God only. Obſerve</hi> (6.) The effect which this Miracle had upon the minds of the people, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled and were amazed, were filled with fear, but not with Faith; Aſtoniſhed, but not Believed. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the ſight of Chriſt's own Miracles is not ſufficient to work Faith in the Soul, without the efficacious Grace of God; the one may make us marvel, the other muſt make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And after thoſe things, he went forth, and ſaw a publican named Levi, ſitting at the receipt of cuſtom, and he ſaid unto him, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me. 28 And he left all, roſe up, and followed him. 29 And Levi made him a great feaſt in his own houſe, and there was a great company of Publicans, and of others that ſate down with them. 30 But the Scribes and Phariſees murmured againſt his Diſciples ſaying, Why do ye eat and drink with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners? 31 And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto them, they that are whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick. 32 I came not to call the Righteous, but ſinners to Repentance.</p>
               <p>The number of our Lord's Diſciples not being filled up, <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) What a free and gracious, what an unexpected and undeſerved Choice Chriſt makes. <hi>Levi,</hi> that is, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> (for he had both Names) a grinding Publican, who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Tax for the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, and was probably Guilty as others were, of the ſins of Covetouſneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, yet is he called to follow Chriſt as a ſpecial Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that ſuch is the freeneſs of Divine Grace, That it ſometimes calls and Converts Sinners unto Chriſt, when they think not of him, nor ſeek unto him. Little did <hi>Levi</hi> now think of a Saviour, much leſs ſeek after him, yet is he here called by him, and that with an efficacious Call; <hi>Matthew,</hi> a Publican, <hi>Zacheus,</hi> an Extortioner, <hi>Saul,</hi> a Perſecutor, all theſe are effectually called by Chriſt, as inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and evidences of the mighty power of Converting Grace. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) <hi>Levi</hi> or <hi>Matthew</hi>'s ready Compliance with Chriſt's Call, <hi>He preſently aroſe and followed him;</hi> when the inward call of the Holy Spirit accompanieth the outward call of the word, the Soul readily complies and yields Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the voice of Chriſt. Our Saviour (ſays the pious Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>) ſpeaks by his word to our Ears, and we hear not, we ſtir not; but when he ſpeaks by his Spirit efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to our Hearts, Satan cannot hold us down, the world ſhall not keep us back; but we ſhall with <hi>Levi,</hi> inſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and follow our Saviour. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) <hi>Levi,</hi> to ſhew his Thankfulneſs to Chriſt, makes him a great Feaſt; Chriſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Levi</hi> to a Diſcipleſhip, <hi>Levi</hi> invites Chriſt to a Dinner, The Servant invites his Maſter, a Sinner invites his Saviour; a better Gueſt he could not invite, Chriſt always comes with his coſt with him; we do not find, that when Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:87"/> was invited to any Table, that he ever refuſed to go; if a Publican, if a Phariſee invited him, he conſtantly went; not ſo much for the pleaſure of eating, as for the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Converſing, and doing good, Chriſt Feaſts us when we feed him; <hi>Levi</hi> to give Chriſt a pledge and ſpecimen of his Love, makes him a Feaſt. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are full of affection towards Chriſt, and very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of their Love unto him. <hi>Levi</hi>'s heart being touch with a ſenſe of Chriſt's rich Love, makes him a Royal Feaſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4) The cavil and exception which the Scribes and Phariſees made at our Lord's free Converſation. They cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him for converſing with ſinners; malice will never want matter of Accuſation. Our Saviour juſtifies himſelf, telling them he convers'd with ſinners as their Phyſician, not as their Companion; <hi>They that are whole need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick:</hi> as if our Lord had ſaid, with whom ſhould a Phyſician converſe, but with his ſick Patients? and is he to be accuſed for that? now this is my caſe. I am come into the World to do the office of a kind Phyſician unto Men; ſurely then I am to take all opportunities of converſing with them, that I may help and heal them, <hi>for they that are ſick need the Phyſician;</hi> but as for you Scribes and Phariſees, who are well and whole in your own Opinion and conceit, I have no hopes of doing good upon you; for ſuch as think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whole, deſire not the Phyſicians help. Now from this Aſſertion of our Saviour, <hi>The whole need not the Phyſician, but the ſick,</hi> theſe Truths are ſuggeſted to us, (1.) That ſin is the Souls malady, its Spiritual diſeaſe and ſickneſs; (2.) That Chriſt is the Phyſician appointed by God for the cure and healing of this Diſeaſe: (3.) That there are multitudes of ſinners ſpiritually ſick, who yet think themſelves ſound and whole. (4.) That ſuch, and only ſuch as find themſelves ſin-ſick, and ſpiritually diſeaſed, are ſubjects capable of Chriſt's healing; <hi>They that are whole need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick. I came not</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>to call the</hi> (Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively) <hi>Righteous, but the</hi> (Senſible) <hi>Sinner to Repentance.</hi>

               <p n="33">33 And they ſaid unto him, why do the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of John faſt often, and make prayers, and likewiſe the Diſciples of the Phariſees? but thine eat and drink. 34 And he ſaid unto them, can ye make the children of the Bride-chamber faſt while the Bridegroom is with them? 35 But the days will come when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken away from them, and then ſhall they faſt in thoſe days. 36 And he ſpake alſo a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment, upon an old, if otherwiſe, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new, agreeth not with the old. 37 And no man putteth new wine into old Bottles: elſe the new wine will burſt the bottles and be ſpilled, and the bottles ſhall periſh. 38 But new wine muſt be put into new bottles, and both are preſerved. 39 No man alſo having drunk old wine, ſtraightway deſireth new, for he ſaith the old is better.</p>
               <p>An Objection is here made againſt the Diſciples of our Saviour, that they did not faſt ſo much, and ſo often as <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s Diſciples did. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples imitated their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who was a Man of an auſtere Life; Chriſt's Diſciples imitated him who was of a more free Converſation. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> therefore our Saviour's Defence which he makes for the not faſting of his Diſciples; he declares, that at preſent it was neither ſuitable nor tolerable, <hi>not ſuitable,</hi> in regard of Chriſt's Bodily Preſence with them, who being their <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> and his Diſciples children of the <hi>Bride-chamber,</hi> it was now a day of Joy and Rejoycing to them, and mourning and faſting would be very improper for them. But when the Bridegroom <hi>ſhall be taken away,</hi> that is, Chriſt's bodily Preſence removed, then there will be cauſe enough for the Diſciples <hi>to faſt,</hi> and mourn. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the Bridegroom of his Spouſe the Church. (2.) That this Bridegroom was to be taken away. (3.) That becauſe of the Bridegroom's Removal, the Church did, ſhall, and muſt faſt; <hi>The days will come when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken away, and then ſhall they faſt.</hi> Again our Saviour declares, that this Diſcipline of faſting was not at preſent <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable</hi> for his Diſciples, for they were at preſent but raw, green and tender, unable to bear the Severities, and rigours of Religion, any more then an old garment can bear a piece of new cloath to be ſet into it, or any more than old Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles can bear new Wine to be put into them. The ſenſe of our Saviour's words ſeems to be this, My Diſciples at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, are tender and weak, newly called and converted, they cannot therefore at preſent undergo the auſterities of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faſtings, weepings, and watchings; but e're long I ſhall leave them, and go to Heaven, from whence I will ſend down my Holy Spirit upon them, which ſhall enable them to all the Duties that the Goſpel enjoins. The Leſſon of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which we may profitably gather from hence, is this, That it is hurtful and dangerous for young converts, for weak Chriſtians, to be put upon the ſeverer Exerciſes of Religion, or to be urged to the performance of ſuch Duties as are above their ſtrength, but they ought to be treated with that tenderneſs which becomes the mild and gentle diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel. Our Saviour (ſays one) doth here commend prudence to his Miniſters, in treating their people according to their ſtrength, and putting them upon Duties according to their Time and Standing: we muſt conſult what Progreſs our People have made in Chriſtianity, and manage accordingly.</p>

How the hypocritical Phariſees blame this Action of the Diſciples, namely, their plucking of the Ears of Corn, yet did they not charge them with Theft for ſo doing; becauſe to take in our great Neceſſity ſo much of our Neighbour's Goods, as we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and knew our Circumſtances he would not deny us, is not Theft. But it was the ſervile Labours on the Sabbath, in gathering the Ears of Corn, which the Phariſees Scruple and Object againſt. Where <hi>Note,</hi> How Hypocrites expend their Zeal in and upon the leſſer things of the Law, whilſt they neglect the greater; placing all Holineſs in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of outward Ceremonies, whilſt they neglect moral Duties. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) The Argument with which our Saviour defends this action of his Diſciples, it is taken from the example of <hi>David:</hi> Neceſſity freed him from fault and blame in eating the Conſecrated Bread, which none but the Prieſts might lawfully eat: For in caſes of Neceſſity, a Ceremonial Precept muſt give place to a moral Duty. Works of mercy, for the preſerving our Lives, and the better fitting us for Sabbath-ſervices, are certainly lawful on the Sabbath-day. <hi>Note</hi> Laſtly, The Argument which our Saviour uſes to prove
<pb facs="tcp:46556:88"/> the Sabbath's Obſervation may be diſpens'd with, in a caſe of abſolute Neceſſity; and that is drawn from that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Chriſt the Inſtitutor and Lord of the Sabbath had over it; <hi>The Son of man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath,</hi> that is, he has Authority and Power, as God, and as Mediator, to inſtitute and appoint a Sabbath, to alter and change it, to diſpenſe with the breach of it, upon a juſt and great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and conſequently acts of Mercy, which tend to fit us for works of Piety not only may, but ought to be done upon the Sabbath-day. This Action of the Diſciples being of that Nature, is without juſt cauſe, cenſured and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Phariſees; a ſort of Men who were reſolved to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at, and quarrel with, whatever our Saviour or his Diſciples either did or ſaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And it came to paſs on another Sabbath, that he entered into the Synagogue and taught, and there was a man whoſe right hand was wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. 7 And the Scribes and Phariſees watched him, whether he would heal on the Sabbath-day, that they might find an accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him. 8 But he knew their thoughts, and ſaid to the man which had the withered hand, riſe up, and ſtand forth in the midſt; and he aroſe and ſtood forth. 9 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the Sabbath-day to do good, or to do evil? to ſave life, or to deſtroy it? 10 And looking round about them all, he ſaid unto the man, ſtretch forth thy hand, and he did ſo, and his hand was reſtored whole as the other. 11 And they were filled with madneſs, and communed one with another, what they might do to Jeſus.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The miraculous cure which our Saviour wrought upon the man which had the withered hand, and (2.) The effect which this Miracle had upon the wicked Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees; in the former <hi>Note,</hi> the place where our Saviour wrought this Miracle, <hi>in the Synagogue,</hi> the Time when, <hi>on the Sabbath-day,</hi> the manner how, by ſpeaking <hi>of a word,</hi> the perſons before whom, namely, the envious and malicious <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Theſe men were always ſlandering Chriſt's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and cavilling at his Miracles, yet does our Holy Lord go on with his Work before their Faces without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the unjuſt cenſures and malicious cavils of wicked men againſt us, for well-doing, muſt not diſcourage us from doing our Duty, either towards God, or towards our Neighbour. Altho' the Phariſees watcht our Saviour wherever he went, and when they could find no occaſion of quarrel, would invent and make one, yet ſuch was our Lord's courage and reſolution, <hi>that he bids the man which had the withered hand ſtand forth,</hi> to ſhew that he was reſolved to heal him, notwithſtanding their malicious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to accuſe him for it as a Breaker of the Sabbath. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition met with in doing our Duty, muſt not diſcourage us from doing good, if we will follow the example of our Bleſſed Redeemer. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The influence and effect which this miracle had upon the wicked Phariſees; they were filled with madneſs and took counſel to kill him: inſtead of being convinced by this Miracle, they conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for it. The Enemies of Chriſt and his Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when Arguments fail, fall to Violence. It is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sign of a weak cauſe, that muſt be ſupported by Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is all Tongue, and no Ear.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Duty which our Holy Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Duty of Prayer. We have much more Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God in Prayer, then Chriſt had; he had no ſins to confeſs, no want of Grace to make known, yet did our Lord ſpend much time, even a whole Night in this Duty! Lord, what delight didſt thou take in paying this Homage to thy Heavenly Father? Oh how doth thy zeal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs condemn our remiſneſs and luke-warmneſs. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (2.) It was ſolitary Prayer that our Lord did ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly delight in; <hi>He went into the mountain alone to pray,</hi> not ſuffering his very Diſciples to be with him. There are Times and Seaſons when a Chriſtian would not be willing that his deareſt Relations upon earth ſhould hear that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which paſſes betwixt him and his God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.)

The Time when Chriſt retired into this Mountain to pray, and ſpent a whole Night in Prayer to God. If we look back to the former part of the chapter, we ſhall find, that it was at a time when the Phariſees were filled with rage and madneſs againſt him, and conſpired to take away his Life. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is our duty at ſuch times eſpecially when Enemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again, if we look forward, the next Verſe tells us, that our Saviour was now about to ſend forth his Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach and propagate the Goſpel. Chriſt thought ſo great a work was not to be done without ſolemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prayer. Accordingly he ſpends an whole Night in Prayer to God upon that occaſion; leaving herein a moſt inſtructive Example to his Church, to continue in Prayer at all times; but then eſpecially to abound in it, when Perſons are to be ſet apart for the momentous work of the Miniſtry, that they may enterprize it with extraordinary dread and caution, not with aſpiring, but tremendous Thoughts, for who is ſufficient for theſe things.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And when it was day, he called unto him his Diſciples, and of them he choſe twelve, whom alſo he named Apoſtles. 14 Simon, whom he alſo named Peter, and Andrew his Brother, James and John, Philip and Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew. 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the ſon of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes. 16 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iſcariot, which was alſo the Traitor.</p>
               <p>As the Jewiſh Church aroſe from Twelve Patriarchs, ſo the Chriſtian Church became planted by Twelve Apoſtles. The Perſon ſending them forth was Chriſt; none may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the work and calling of the Miniſtry but thoſe whom Chriſt appoints and calls, not immediately by himſelf, but mediately by the Governours of his Church; The Perſons Commiſſioned were Diſciples before they were Apoſtles; to <hi>Teach</hi> us, That Chriſt will have ſuch as preach the Goſpel, to be Diſciples before they are Miniſters, Trained up in the Faith and Doctrine of the Goſpel, before they undertake a publick charge. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, how carefully the names of the Twelve Apoſtles, thoſe Laborious perſons in the ſervice of Souls are Recorded, and tranſmitted with honour to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. God will ſignally honour thoſe who ſingularly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and are the ſpecial Inſtruments of his Glory. Of the Twelve Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> is named firſt, and <hi>Judas</hi> laſt; <hi>Peter</hi> is firſt named, becauſe probably elder then the reſt, or becauſe for order-ſake he might ſpeak before the reſt; from whence may be inferred a Primacy, but no Supremacy; a priority of Order, but no Superiority of Degree; as the Fore-man of a Grand-Jury has a precedency, but no prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, he is firſt in order before the reſt, but has no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the reſt; neither did St. <hi>Peter</hi> ever aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a power of deciding Controverſies; but we find St. <hi>James</hi> in that firſt General Council mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15.13. ſpeaking ſomewhat definitively, Thus I judge or determine the matter, and yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> was then and there preſent. Had the champions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuch a paſſage in all the Scripture for St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Authority, it would make a louder noiſe then <hi>Paſce Oves,</hi> Feed my Sheep, St. <hi>John</hi> 21.16. Again, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> is named firſt, ſo Judas is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned laſt, with a Brand of Infamy upon him; the Traditor, the Perſon that Betrayed his Lord and Maſter: From whence we may gather, that tho' the Truth of Grace be abſolutely neceſſary to a Miniſters Salvation, yet the want of it doth not diſanul his Office, nor hinder the lawfulneſs of his miniſtry. <hi>Judas,</hi> tho' a Traitor was yet a lawful Miniſter; an Heart-hypocrite
<pb facs="tcp:46556:88"/> is no hypocrite, <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> before the Church, tho' he ſhall be damn'd for his Hypocriſy before God.</p>
               <p n="17">17 And he came down with them, and ſtood in the plain, and the company of his Diſciples, and a great multitude of people, out of all Judea, and Jeruſalem, and from the coaſt of Tyre and Sidon which came to hear him, and to be healed of their Diſeaſes. 18 And they that were vexed with unclean Spirits, and they were healed. 19 And the whole multitude ſought to touch him; for there went vertue out of him, and he healed them all.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.)

When our Saviour firſt began to Preach, the people came unto him from every quarter. His Miniſters find it thus, at our firſt coming among a people, our Labours are moſt acceptable, and they do moſt good. Our peoples affections are then warmeſt, and perhaps our own too. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) What ſort of People they were who attended thus zealouſly on our Saviour's Miniſtry, they were the common and ordinary People; the poor received the Goſpel; the learned Scribes, the knowing Phariſees, thoſe wiſe men after the Fleſh, the Mighty, the Noble, the great and Honourable, theſe deſpiſed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Perſon, ſlighted his Miniſtry, yea ſought to take away his Life.

                  </gap>r and meaner ſort of People have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glad Tidings of Salvation; it is a ſad, but a certain Truth, that Heaven is a place where few (comparatively, but very few) of the great Men of the World are like to come. Their Temptations are many, their Corruptions ſtrong, and their great Eſtates, thro' their own abuſe, become fewel to to their Luſts: Lord! how rare is it to find thoſe that are Eminently Great, Exemplary Good. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Nature of our Saviour's Miracles; <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles were as great Judgments as Wonders, but Chriſt's Miracles were as great Mercies as Wonders, they were ſalubrious and healing, there went Vertue out of him, and he healed them all. Chriſt's Miracles were like the Author of them, full of Goodneſs, yet would not the obſtinate phariſees be convinced, either by the Goodneſs that was in them, or by that omnipotent power which wrought them: All our Saviour's Miracles were wonderful, but Wonders of Love and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And he lifted up his eyes on his Diſciples, and ſaid, Bleſſed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>As our Saviour's Condition in this World was very poor, ſo was his Diſciples condition alſo; therefore to relieve them againſt their poverty and low eſtate in the World, he thus beſpeaks them, <hi>Bleſſed be ye poor,</hi> you that believe in me, and follow me, are in a happier condition, then thoſe that are rich, and received their conſolation, <hi>for yours is the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Chriſt was the poor man's preacher, and the poor man's comforter; yet a bare outward Poverty, or an avowed voluntary Poverty, will entitle none to the Bleſſing. 'Tis not a Poverty of Poſſeſſion, but a poverty of Spirit, that makes us members of the Kingdom of Grace, and heirs of the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Bleſſed are ye that hunger now, for ye ſhall be filled.</p>
               <p>Hunger and Thirſt are not Bleſſings in themſelves, nor yet are they curſes in themſelves, ſanctified hunger is a far greater Bleſſing, then ſurfeiting Fulneſs. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adds, <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs. Learn</hi> thence (1.) That ſuch as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, are certainly in an Happy and Bleſſed Condition. (2.) That the Happineſs of thoſe who do hunger and thirſt after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, conſiſts in <hi>being filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 Bleſſed are ye that weep now, for ye ſhall laugh.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, you my Diſciples that are now in a ſad, mournful, and afflicted State are Bleſſed, for there will come a time when ye ſhall be Comforted, a time when God ſhall wipe away all Tears from your Eyes; yet muſt we not think, that we have nothing to do but to mourn, there is a time to Rejoyce, as well as to Mourn, nor that bare Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Weeping is in it ſelf, and for its own ſake accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God. But when we mourn rationally for our own Sins, and the ſins of others, God will comfort us in this World by his Word and Spirit, and in the World to come with the ſight of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Bleſſed are ye when Men ſhall hate you, and when they ſhall ſeparate you from their Company, and ſhall Reproach you, and caſt out your name as evil, for the Son of man's ſake. 23 Rejoyce ye in that day, and leap for joy; for behold your reward is great in Heaven; for in like manner did their fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the prophets.</p>

The Sufferers deſcribed, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and their Sufferings foretold, ye ſhall be hated, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and reproached. Hatred of Chriſt's Diſciples is the bitter Root from which Perſecution grows; where there is Hatred in the Heart, no wonder that Reviling is in the Lips. Thoſe that are Hated, are ſure to be reproached, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the Church of Chriſt, having their names caſt out, or blotted out of the Rolls of the Church. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (2.) For what cauſe they ſuffer all this, <hi>For the Son of man's ſake,</hi> for their reſpect to Chriſt and his Holy Religion, for their regard to his Worſhip and holy Inſtitutions. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſuch Diſciples as will cordially embrace, and ſtedfaſtly hold faſt the Faith delivered by our Saviour, muſt expect and prepare for hatred and perſecution, to be ſeparated from ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society, excommunicated from Church-fellowſhip, and all this by them who ſhall call themſelves the Guides and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of an Infallible Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) that tho' St. <hi>Luke</hi> omits divers of the Beatitudes mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew; ch.</hi> 5. yet he reciteth the Woes which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> omitteth. If we will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Saviour's Doctrine fully, we muſt conſult all the Evangeliſts thoroughly. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) Theſe Woes are not to be underſtood abſolutely, but reſtrainedly, the Wo does not belong to Men, becauſe they are <hi>Rich,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>full,</hi> becauſe they do <hi>laugh;</hi> but becauſe they place their happineſs in theſe things, take up with them for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rejoyce in them as their chief Good. Valluing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by what they have in hand, not by what they have in hope: He that is Rich and Righteous, he that is Great and Gracious; he that has his hands full of this World, and his heart empty of pride and vain Confidences, he that laughs when God ſmiles, he that expreſſes himſelf joyfully, when God expreſſes himſelf Graciouſly; ſuch a man is rich in Grace, who is thus gracious in the midſt of Riches; for to be Rich and Holy, argues much Riches of Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Wo unto you, when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you, for ſo did their fathers to the falſe prophets.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour's deſign in theſe Words, is not to condemn any of his Diſciples or Miniſters, who have, by doing their Duty, gain'd a fair Reputation amongſt the men of the World; but to let us underſtand how rarely and ſeldom it is attained; for uſually the beſt men are worſt ſpoken of; neither the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, nor <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> the Prophet of the New Teſtament, nor Chriſt himſelf, nor his Apoſtles, did ever gain either the good Will, or the good Word of the Men of that Generation in which they
<pb facs="tcp:46556:89"/> Lived. The Applauſe of the Multitude (that contingent Judge of Good and Evil) rather attends the vain then the vertuous. None have ever been ſo much reproached by man as the Faithful Miniſters of God, who have learnt to take pleaſure in Reproaches: For tho' Grace does not bid us invite Reproaches, yet it teaches us to bid them welcome. The World has all along taken effectual care, by their cruel mockings, bitter Reproaches, ſharp invectives, to free the Miniſters of God in all Ages from the danger of our Saviour's Wo here denounced; <hi>Wo unto you when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Noble Spirit of Chriſtianity, and the large extent of Chriſtian Charity; the Jewiſh kindneſs was limited and confined, to thoſe of their own Religion, Kindred and Nation, their Charity began and ended at home; but our Saviour obliges his Followers to the exerciſe of a more extenſive Charity, even to all Mankind, even the worſt of men, our Enemies that ſeek our Deſtruction. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is ſo far from allowing us to perſecute them that hate us, that it commands us to Love them that Perſecute us. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Nature and quality of the Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> there the inward affection is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you;</hi> there outward civility and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability is required; <hi>Do good to them that hate you;</hi> here real acts of kindneſs &amp; beneficence are required to be done to the worſt of Enemies, tho' they be guilty of the worſt of Crimes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumly and cruelty, ſtriking both at our Reputation, and our Life. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſtianity obliges us to bear a ſincere Love to our moſt malicious Enemies, to be ready at all times to pray for them, and upon all occaſions to do good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; Thus to do, is an imitation of God our Maker, of Chriſt our Maſter: 'Tis for the good of this lower World, and the way to a Better; 'tis the Ornament of our Religion, the perfection of our Nature, and an high degree and pitch of Vertue. To which may be added the next Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>not to revenge injuries;</hi> where private Revenge is the thing forbidden; and we are directed, rather to ſuffer a double Wrong, then to ſeek a private Revenge: Chriſtianity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to bear many injuries patiently, rather then to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge one privately; we muſt leave the matter to God, and the Magiſtrate. The truth is, Revenge is a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and vexatious paſſion, the mans Soul ſwells and boils, and is in pain and anguiſh, and has no eaſe. Beſides, by our Revenging of one injury, we neceſſarily draw on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo bring on a perpetual Circulation of Injuries and Revenges; whereas forgiveneſs prevents vexation to others, and diſquietment to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Give to every one that asketh of thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and the like Precepts of our Saviour are not to be taken ſtrictly but reſtrainedly; we are thereby obliged to Charity according to others Neceſſities, and our own Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but not bound to give to every one that has the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ask for what we have. Indeed every Man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wants is the proper Object of our Chriſtian Charity; and we muſt with a compaſſionate Heart and open Hand relieve him, according to his Neceſſity, but anſwerably to our Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Nor muſt the ſecond part of the Verſe be underſtood as forbidding Chriſtians to ſeek the Recovery of their juſt Rights, by purſuing Thieves, and following the Law upon Oppreſſors; but requiring us to forbear all Acts of private Revenge, as directly contrary to the Spirit and Temper of Chriſtianity, as Jealouſy is the Rage of a Man, ſo Revenge is the Rage of the Devil; 'tis the very Soul and Spirit of the Apoſtate Nature.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And as ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo to them likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour lays down a moſt excellent Rule of Life, for all his Diſciples and Followers to walk by, namely, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to do as we would be done by. The Golden Rule of Juſtice and Equity in all our Dealings with Men, is this, <hi>To do as we would be done unto.</hi> It is a full Rule, a clear Rule, a moſt juſt and equitable Rule, which the Light of Nature, and the Law of Chriſt binds upon us. St. <hi>Matthew, Ch.</hi> 7.12. adds, that <hi>this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> that is, the Sum of the Old Teſtament, and the Subſtance of the Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cond Table. The whole of the Law is this, to Love GOD above our ſelves, and to Love our Neighbour as our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="32">32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them. 33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for ſinners alſo do even the ſame. 34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for ſinners alſo lend to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to receive as much again. 35 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again, and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the children of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; for he is kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil. 36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your father alſo is merciful.</p>
               <p>The Deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour in all and every of theſe Precepts, is to recommend unto us, all ſorts and kinds of mercy and charity; namely, charity in giving, charity in forgiving, charity in lending; it is ſometimes our Duty (if we have ability) to Lend to ſuch poor Perſons as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect will ever be in a Capacity, either to repay, or to requite us. This is to imitate the Divine Bounty, which does Good to all, even to the unthankful, and to the unholy. Love for Love, is juſtice; Love for no Love, is favour and kindneſs; but Love and Charity, mercy and compaſſion to all Perſons, even the undeſerving and ill-deſerving, this is Divine Goodneſs, a Chriſt-like Temper which will render us illuſtrious on Earth, and glorious in Heaven. St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays here, <hi>Be ye merciful, as your Father it merciful.</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> ſays, Ch. 5. laſt, <hi>Be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect,</hi> implying, that love and mercy, charity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, is the perfection of a Chriſtians Grace; he that is made perfect in Love, is perfect in all Divine Graces in the Account of God. Perfection in all Graces, but eſpecially in Love and Charity, ought to be our Aim in this Life, and ſhall be our attainment in the next.</p>
               <p n="37">37 Judge not, and ye ſhall not be judged, condemn not, and ye ſhall not be condemned, forgive and ye ſhall be forgiven.</p>
               <p>This Prohibition, <hi>Judge not,</hi> is not to be underſtood of our ſelves, but our Neighbours. Self-judging is a great and neceſſary Duty; raſh judging of others, is an heinous and grievous ſin, which expoſes to the Righteous judgment of God: it is private judging, and private condemning of Perſons which Chriſt forbids; it follows, <hi>Forgive, and ye ſhall be forgiven;</hi> not that a bare forgiving of others, is all that God requires in order to our forgiveneſs. But it is one part of that Obedience which we owe to God, without which it is in vain to expect forgiveneſs from God; <hi>Forgive, and ye ſhall be forgiven.</hi>

               <p>I think there is not any one Text of Scripture that declares the Bounty of God more fully in Rewarding Acts of Charity and Mercy, then this before us. Oh how liberal a Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter is God? How ſure and bountiful are the returns he makes to us for the relief given to him in his Members; he promiſes us here (1.) not bare meaſure, but <hi>good meaſure,</hi> (2.) <hi>preſſed down, ſhaken together, and running over;</hi> nothing
<pb facs="tcp:46556:89"/> adds more to the Meaſure then the ſhaking of the Buſhel, the crowding and preſſing of the Corn, and heaping till the meaſure runneth over; now a meaſure will run over, as long as you will pour. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Charities done in Faith, in Obedience to God, and with an eye to the Glory of God, will produce a certain and plentiful Increaſe; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is the way to Riches; Giving is the beſt and ſureſt way of Thriving; a little Charity from us, if we have but a little, is look'd upon by God as a great deal. But it is the greateſt imprudence, as well as impiety, to do but a little when we have ability to do much, for he that ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully, <hi>good meaſure, preſſed down, and running over.</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour doubtleſs apply'd theſe words to the Scribes and Phariſees; the Jewiſh Leaders, their Doctors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who being ignorant of the ſpiritual ſenſe of the Law, (Interpreting it only to the reſtraining of the outward Man) they were very unfit to inſtruct and lead others; for where one blind man leads another, both are in danger of the Ditch, that is, to run into Ruine and Deſtruction. <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That ignorant, erroneous, or unfaithful Miniſters, are the greateſt plague, and ſoareſt puniſhment that can befal a people. (2.) That Chriſt having fore-warned us of ſuch Guides, to follow them will be an inexcuſable ſin and folly, and never free us from the danger of Deſtruction, but rather be an aggravation of our Condemnation: <hi>If the blind follow the blind, both will</hi> inevitably, yet inexcuſably <hi>fall into the Ditch.</hi>

               <p>The Application of theſe words no doubt our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his own Diſciples, partly to comfort them under Sufferings, and partly to encourage them to Obedience: Did they ſuffer hard things from an unkind World? the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what their Maſter ſuffered before them may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, did they meet with hard and difficult Duties, ſuch as loving Enemies, doing good to them that hate and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them? Their Lord's Example may encourage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, who loved them when they were Enemies, who prayed for his Murtherers, and offered up his Blood to God on the behalf of them that ſhed it. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Perfection of a Chriſtian in this World, conſiſteth in his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt Jeſus in being as our Maſter, in coming as near to his Example as it is poſſible for perſons cloathed with Fleſh and Blood to arrive at, <hi>Every one that is perfect muſt be as his maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41 And why beholdeſt thou the mote which is in thy Brothers eye? but perceiveſt not the Beam which is in thine own eye. 42 Either how canſt thou ſay to thy Brother, Brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye? when thou thy ſelf beholdeſt not the Beam that is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, caſt out firſt the Beam out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy Brothers eye.</p>
               <p>By the Mote in our Brother's eye, is meant ſome ſmall and little ſins diſcerned, or ſome ſin ſuſpected. By the Beam in our own Eye, ſome greater ſin undiſcerned: Now ſays our Saviour, there is no greater ſign of Hypocriſy then to be curious in ſpying out the ſmaller faults of others, and at the ſame time indulge greater in our ſelves. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That there is no ſuch way to teach us Charity in judging of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to exerciſe ſeverity in judging of our ſelves.

That thoſe who deſire others ſhould look upon their failings with a Compaſſionate Eye, muſt not look upon the Failings of others with a cenſorious Eye; <hi>for with what meaſure we meet, it ſhall be meaſured to us again.</hi>

               <p n="43">43 For a good Tree bringeth not forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fruit, neither doth a corrupt Tree bring forth good fruit. 44 For every Tree is known by his own Fruit; for of thorns men do not gather Figs, nor of a Bramble-buſh do they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grapes. 45 A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here and elſewhere frequently compares Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Trees; the Heart of Man is as the Root, the Actions as the Fruit; as the root is the principle from which the Fruit ſprings, ſo the heart of man is the Principle from which all humane Actions flow; an holy Heart will be accompanied with an Holy Life; where there is a vital principle of Grace within, there will be the actings of Grace without: a good Conſcience will be accompanied with a good Converſation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, a double Treaſure diſcovered in the heart of Man, (1.) an Evil Treaſure of ſin and corruption, from whence flow evil Things; but why ſhould ſin be called a Treaſure? not for the preciouſneſs of it, but for the abundance of it; a little doth not make a Treaſure; and alſo for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it: for tho' ſin be perpetually over-flowing in the Life, yet doth the Heart continue full. The Treaſure of Original Corruption in man's Heart and Nature, tho' by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace it be drawn low, yet it is never in this Life drawn dry. (2.) Here is a good Treaſure of Grace diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſanctified and renewed Man, which is the ſource and ſpring from whence all gracious Actions do proceed and flow, namely, a ſanctified and renewed Heart and Nature. When once the Will of Man is made conformable to the Will of God, it doth will and deſire, chooſe and embrace, take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight in what God approves, commands, and Loves; and it will lay an injunction upon all the Members of the Body to act Conformably thereunto.</p>
               <p n="46">46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay? 47 Whoſoever cometh to me, and heareth my ſayings, and doth them, I will ſhew you to whom he is like. 48 He is like a man which built an houſe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock, and when the flood aroſe, the ſtream beat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently upon that houſe, and could not ſhake it, for it was founded upon a rock. 49 But he that heareth and doth not, is like a man, that without a foundation, built an houſe upon the earth, againſt which the ſtream did beat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, and immediately it fell, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of that houſe was great.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here concludes his Sermon with an Elegant Similitude; He compares the Faithful doer of the Word to a wiſe Builder, which founded his Houſe upon a Rock. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he reſembles to a fooliſh Builder, that built his houſe upon the Sand; the <hi>houſe</hi> is the hope of Heaven and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, the Rock is Chriſt, the building upon the Sand, is reſting upon the bare performance of outward Duties; the <hi>Rain,</hi> the <hi>Winds,</hi> and the <hi>Floods,</hi> are all kinds of afflicting Evils, Sufferings and Perſecutions that may befal us. The Sum is, men's hopes of Salvation built upon any other beſides Chriſt, or built upon Chriſt without a ſincere and uniform Obedience to him, are vain hopes, deceitful hopes; for when the Storm ariſes, when affliction or Perſecution comes, their Confidence will fail them, their Foundation will be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That the Obedient Believer is the only wiſe Man; that builds his hopes of Heaven upon a ſure and abiding Foundation; Chriſt is the Rock that he builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and one Chriſt is before a thouſand Creatures; one Rock better than millions of Sands to build upon. (2.) That ſuch Profeſſors as reſt in the bare performance of outward Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are fooliſh Builders, their Foundation is weak and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and all their hopes of Salvation vain and deceitful. Lord, how does the Carnal World build all their hopes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sand, on the wiſdom of the Fleſh, on their Policies, Counſels, Friends and Riches, They bottom their very Souls
<pb facs="tcp:46556:90"/> upon Fancies, Preſumptions, Deluſions and vain hopes; they expect to be Happy without being Holy, which is to expect to be eaſy without being Healthy. Wo to that Man whoſe Portion lies in the Creatures hands, who builds all his hopes upon this Earth, for when the Earth is ſhaken his hopes are ſhaken, his heart is ſhaken, and he is even at his Wits ends: Whereas the Chriſtian that builds upon the Rock, he ſtands firm and ſure; for if ever the Chriſtian falls Chriſt muſt fall with him; he ſhall never be diſappointed of his hopes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Faithfulneſs can diſappoint; he ſhall never be deceived, unleſs Truth it ſelf can deceive. If it be impoſſible for God to Lye, then it is impoſſible for the Obedient, Holy, and circumſpect Chriſtian finally to miſcarry.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The former part of this Chapter relates to us a double Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought by our Bleſſed Saviour, the one in raiſing the Centurion's Servant from his bed, the other in raiſing the Widows Son from his Biere; both of them eminent acts and inſtances of his divine and Almighty Power. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the former stands thus.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 NOW when Jeſus had ended all his ſayings in the audience of the people, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into Capernaum. 2 And a certain Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions Servant, who was dear unto him, was ſick and ready to dye. 3 And when he heard of Jeſus, he ſent unto him the Elders of the Jews, beſeeching him that he would come and heal his ſervant. 4 And when they came to Jeſus, they beſought him inſtantly, ſaying, that he was worthy for whom he ſhould do this. 5 For he loveth our Nation, and he hath built us a Synagogue. 6 Then Jeſus went with them, and when he was now not far from the houſe, the Centurion ſent friends unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, Lord, trouble not thy ſelf, for I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt enter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Roof. 7 Wherefore neither thought I my ſelf worthy to come unto thee, but ſay in a word and my Servant ſhall be healed, 8 For I alſo am a man ſet under authority, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me Soldiers, and I ſay unto one go, and he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh, and to my ſervant do this, and he doth it. 9 When Jeſus heard theſe things he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and ſaid unto the people that followed him: I ſay unto you I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael. 10 And they that were ſent returning to the houſe found the ſervant whole that had been ſick.</p>
               <p>In our Saviour's miraculous Cure of the Centurions Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, we have ſeveral particulars very <hi>Obſervable,</hi> as (1.) the perſon applying himſelf to our Bleſſed Saviour for help and healing; he was a Gentile, an Heathen, a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier, an Officer and Commander; yet he believes in, and relies upon the Power of Chriſt. <hi>Note,</hi> That ſuch is the freeneſs of Divine Grace, that it extends it ſelf to all Sorts and Ranks, to all Orders and Degrees of Men without Exception; Even the bloody Trade of War yields worthy Clyents to Chriſt; he doth not ſo much Regard what we are, and whence we are, as what we be, and with what Diſpoſitions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, with what Purpoſes and Inclinations we come unto him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Perſon whom the Centurion came to Chriſt for; not for himſelf, not for his ſon, but for his ſervant; <hi>his ſervant was ſick:</hi> He doth not drive him out of Doors, nor ſtand gazing by his Bed-ſide, but looks out for help and relief for him; a worthy Example of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Some Maſters have not ſo much regard to their ſick Servants, as they have to their Oxen and their Swine. Bu the is not worthy of a good Servant, that in a time of ſickneſs is not willing to ſerve his Servant. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Unto whom the Centurion ſeeks, and with what zeal and application; he ſeeks not to Wizards and Conjurers, but to the Phyſician for his ſick Servant, yea to Chriſt the chief Phyſician; and this not with a formal Relation in his Mouth, but with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement aggravation of his Diſeaſe, <hi>My Servant lyes ſick of the Palſy grievouſly tormented,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.6. where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's condolency, and tender ſympathy with his afflicted Servant, is both matter of Commendation and Imitation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The happy mixture of Humility and Faith, which was found in this Centurion. See his wonderful Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in not thinking himſelf worthy to come into Chriſt's preſence, or that Chriſt ſhould come under his Roof. The beſt Men have always the loweſt Thoughts of themſelves; when we eſteem our ſelves unworthy of any favours, Chriſt accounts us worthy of all. See alſo his Faith in Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, he believed that Chriſt was able at a Diſtance, and by a ſingle word to command off the Diſtemper of his Servant; he tells him, that Diſeaſes were as much at Chriſt's command, as his Servants were at his command. Humility we ſee is both the fruit of Faith, and the companion of Faith. An humble Soul has evermore an high Eſteem of Chriſt's Power, and a low eſteem of it ſelf. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) How our Bleſſed Saviour exceeds not only the Centurion's Deſires, but his Expectations alſo, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, I will come and heal him.</hi> Oh wonderful Condeſcenſion! In St. <hi>John</hi> 4.47. We read of a certain Noble-man and Ruler that twice entreated our Saviour to come to his houſe, and heal his Son, but our Lord refuſed. Here the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion doth but barely tell Chriſt of his poor Servants ſickneſs and Chriſt, both unask'd and undeſired, ſays, <hi>I will come and heal him:</hi> Oh how far was Chriſt from ſeeming in the leaſt to honour Riches and deſpiſe Poverty; he that came in the form of a Servant, goes down to viſit a ſick Servant upon his poor Pallet-Bed, who did not come near the rich Couch of the Ruler's Son. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (6.) The Notice and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our Saviour takes of the Centurion's Faith; he wondered at it from him; Admiration agreed not to Chriſt as God, but as Man it did: Chriſt wrought this Faith as God, and wondered at it as Man: What can be more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, then to ſee Chriſt wonder? We find not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our wondering at Worldly pomp and greatneſs; when the Diſciples wondered at the Magnificence and Stately Buildings of the Temple, Chriſt rather rebuked them then wondered with them. But when he ſees the gracious acts and exerciſe of Faith, he is raviſhed with wonder. Let it <hi>teach</hi> us to place our Admiration where Chriſt fixes his; let us be more affected with the leaſt meaſures of Grace in a go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d man, then with all the Gaieties and Glories of a great Man; let us not Envy the one, but admire and imitate the other. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſt doth not only admire the Centurion's Faith, but publiſhes it, <hi>Verily I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael;</hi> that is, amongſt the generality of the Jewiſh Nation. For as to particular Perſons, ſeveral had ſhewed a greater Faith then this, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary:</hi> This Expreſſion lets us know, that where the Means of Faith are but ſmall, the Noble Acts and Exerciſe of Faith are wonderful, and Soul-amazing.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And it came to paſs the day after, that he went into a city called Naïn, and many of his Diſciples went with him, and much people. 12 Now when he came nigh to the gates of the city, behold there was a dead man carried out, the only ſon of his mother, and ſhe was a widow, and much people of the city was with her. 13 And when the Lord ſaw her, he had compaſſion on her, and ſaid, Weep not. 14 And he came and touched the Biere, and they that bare him, ſtood ſtill; and he ſaid, Young man, I ſay unto thee ariſe. 15 And he that was Dead, ſate up, and began to ſpeak, and he delivered him to his mother. 16 And there came a fear on all, and they glorified God, ſaying, That a great prophet is riſen up amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:90"/> us, and that God hath viſited his people. 17 And the rumour of him went forth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Judea, and throughout all the Region round about.</p>
               <p>There were three perſons raiſed from Death to Life by the powerful word of Chriſt's Mouth; namely, <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew; Lazarus,</hi> Recorded by St. <hi>John;</hi> and here the Widows Son, only taken notice of by St. <hi>Luke.</hi> The place where this Miracle was wrought was the City of <hi>Nain;</hi> out of their Cities, and not within them the Jews were wont to Bury their Dead. Our Saviour at the Gate of this City meets with the ſad pomp of a Funeral; a ſorrowful Widow attended with her mournful Neighbours, following her only Son to the Grave. Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The doleful and diſtreſſed Condition of the Widow; there were many Heart-piercing Circumſtances in her Affliction; (1.) It was the death of a Son; to bury a child rends the Heart of a Parent, for what are Children but the Parent multiplied? but to lay a Son in the Grave, which continues the Name, and ſupports the Family, is a ſore affliction. (2.) This Son was a young Man, in the ſtrength and flower of his Age, not carried from the Cradle to the Coffin: had he dy'd an Infant, he had not been ſo much lamented; but then, when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Expectations were higheſt, and the endearments grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, even in the flower of his Age he is cut off. (3.) He was not only a Son, but an only Son; one in whom all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hopes and comforts were bound up. The Death of one out of many is much more tolerable, then of all in one. The Loſs of that one admits of no Conſolation. (4.) Still to heighten the affliction, it is added, that <hi>ſhe was a Widow,</hi> ſhe wanted the Counſel and Support of a loving Yoke-fellow. Had the Root been left entire, ſhe might better have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Branch; now both are cut down, and ſhe has none left to comfort her in her comfortleſs State of Widowhood. In this Diſtreſſed condition, Chriſt the God of Comfort meets her, pities her, relieves her. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The compaſſion of Chriſt towards this Diſtreſſed Widow, <hi>He ſaw her, and had compaſſion on her.</hi> Chriſt ſaw her, ſhe did not ſpeak to him; no Tears, no Prayers can move Chriſt ſo much as our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and his own Compaſſions: Chriſt's Heart pitied her, his Tongue ſaid to her, <hi>Weep not,</hi> his Feet went to the Biere, his Hand <hi>touched the Coffin,</hi> and the Power of his Godhead <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Dead.</hi> But how ſtrange doth Chriſt's Counſel ſeem, to bid a Mother not weep for ſuch a Loſs, was to perſwade her to be miſerable, and not feel it; to feel it, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it; to regard it, and yet conceal and hide it: It is not the decent expreſſion of our Sorrow then which Chriſt condemns, but the undue exceſs, and extravagancies of it which our Saviour blames. And the Leſſon of Inſtruction which we <hi>Learn</hi> from hence, is this, That Chriſtian's ought to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their Sorrow for their dead Relations, how many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting circumſtances and aggravations ſoever do meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Death; here was a Child, that Child a Son, that Son an only Son, that only Son carried to the Grave in the flower of his Age; yet Chriſt ſays to the penſive Mother, a ſorrowful Widow, <hi>Weep not. Obſerve</hi> (3.) The power of Chriſt, in raiſing the Widows Son to Life. The Lord of Life Arreſts the Serjeant Death, and Reſcues the Priſoner out of his hand: Chriſt ſays not, In the Name of God, young man, ariſe, but <hi>I ſay unto thee, Ariſe.</hi> Chriſt had a power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of himſelf, to command the Dead to ariſe, and the ſame powerful Voice which Raiſed this young Man, ſhall in the laſt Day, Raiſe up our vaniſhed Bodies? For is it not as eaſy for Omnipotency to ſay, let them be Repaired, as to ſay at firſt, let them be made? <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Reality of the Miracle, <hi>he ſits up,</hi> he <hi>begins to ſpeak,</hi> and <hi>is delivered to his Mother:</hi> Death has no power to hold that man down, whom the Son of God bids riſe up; <hi>immediately he that was dead ſate up;</hi> and the ſame power which raiſed One Man, can raiſe a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, a Million, a World; no Power can raiſe one Man, but an Almighty Power, and that which is Almighty can raiſe all Men. It was not ſo much for the Child's ſake, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſake that the Son was Raiſed; it was an injury to the Son, tho' a kindneſs to the Mother, for he muſt twice paſs thro' the Gates of Death, to others once; it returned him from Reſt to Labour, from the peaceful Harbour, back again to the Tempeſtuous Ocean. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, What effect this Miracle had upon the Multitude, ſeeing the Divine Power thus manifeſtly exerted, they are filled with Aſtoniſhment and Amazement, they look upon our Saviour with awful and admiring Looks, <hi>They glorify and praiſe God for ſending a great Prophet amongſt them,</hi> accounting it a great act of Favour that God had in this wonderful manner viſited his People; yet a Prophet was the higheſt Name they could find for him, whom they ſaw like themſelves in ſhape, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove themſelves in power, <hi>a Great Prophet is riſen up amongſt us, and God has viſited his people.</hi>

               <p n="18">18 And the Diſciples of John ſhewed him of all theſe things. 19 And John calling unto him two of his Diſciples, ſent them unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſaying, Art thou he that ſhould come, or look we for another? 20 When the men were come unto him, they ſaid, John Baptiſt hath ſent us unto thee, ſaying, Art thou he that ſhould come, or look we for another? 21 And in that ſame hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and unto many that were blind he gave ſight. 22 Then Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto them, Go your way and tell John what things ye have ſeen and heard; how that the Blind ſee, the Lame walk, the Lepers are cleanſed, the Deaf hear, the Dead are raiſed, to the poor the Goſpel is preached. 23 And bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</p>
               <p>About the time of our Saviour's appearing in the World, there was a general Expectation of a great Prince that ſhould come out of <hi>Judea,</hi> and govern all Nations: This Prince the Jews called the Meſſias, or the anointed, and waited for his Appearance. Accordingly, when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the quality of an extraordinary Prophet, the Jews ſent to know of him, whether he was the Meſſias or not, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. he anſwered that he was not, but only the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger and Fore-runner of the Meſſias: So that it is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that it was not for <hi>John</hi>'s own information that he ſent two of his Diſciples to Chriſt, to know whether he was the Meſſias or not; for <hi>John</hi> was aſſured of it himſelf, by a voice from Heaven at our Saviour's Baptiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt;</hi> but it was for his Diſciples Satisfaction, that he ſent them to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; becauſe <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples were unwilling to acknowledge Chriſt to be the Meſſias, out of a great Zeal for the honour of him their Maſter; they were not willing to own any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon greater then <hi>John</hi> their Maſter, leſt ſuch an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould Eclipſe and cloud him; from whence we may <hi>Note,</hi> how the Judgments of the Beſt Men, are very apt to be Byaſſed and Perverted by Faction or Intereſt; no doubt <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples were good Men, and no doubt their Maſter had often told them as he did others, that he was not the Meſſias, yet they will not believe their own Maſter, when they apprehend him to ſpeak againſt their own Intereſt; for they knew, that they muſt Riſe and Fall in their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſteem, as their Maſter did; therefore that <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples might receive full ſatisfaction from Chriſt, he ſends two of his Diſciples to him, to hear his Doctrine, and ſee his Miracles; for <hi>John</hi> perceiving his Diſciples to be ill-affected towards our Saviour, and hearing them ſpeak with ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of his Miracles, he ſent them to him, that being Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of what he did, they might be convinced who he was. <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the way and means which our Saviour takes to convince and ſatisfy <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples that he was the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias; he appeals to the Miracles wrought by himſelf, and ſubmits thoſe Miracles to the Judgment and Examination of their Senſes; <hi>Go and ſhew John the Miracles which you hear and ſee; the Blind receive their ſight, the lame walk, the deaf hear;</hi> Chriſt was all this in a Literal and Spiritual Senſe alſo; he was an Eye of Underſtanding to the Ignorant, a Foot of Power to the weak, he opened an Ear in Deaf Hearts, to receive the word of Life; and the poor receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel. Miracles are the higheſt Atteſtation, and the greateſt external Confirmation and Evidence that can be given to the Truth and Divinity of any Doctrine. Now our Saviour's Miracles for their Nature, they were Divine and God-like, they were healing and beneficial to Mankind, freeing Men
<pb facs="tcp:46556:91"/> from the greateſt Calamities of Humane Life, for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they were many, for their manner of their Operation, they were publickly wrought in the Sight and View of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people, to free them from all ſuſpicion of fraud and Impoſture; he wrought them before his Enemies, as well as in the preſence of his Friends and Followers, and this not done once or twice, or in one place, but at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral places wherever he came, and this for a long time, even for three years and an half; ſo that our Bleſſed Saviour had all the Atteſtation that Miracles can give, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence himſelf the true and promiſed Meſſias.</p>
               <p n="22">22 To the poor the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The poor Hear and Receive the Goſpel, See on <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Note,</hi> that all along in our Saviour's time and ſince, the poor of the World have been more diſpoſed to hear and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel then other men, and the Reaſons of it are theſe; (1.) Becauſe the poor have no Worldly Intereſt to Engage them to reject Chriſt and his Goſpel; the High Prieſts, the Scribes and Phariſees had a plain Worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to engage them to oppoſe Chriſt and his Doctrine. But the Poor were free from theſe Incumbrances and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They had nothing to looſe, therefore our Saviour's Doctrine went down more eaſily with them, becauſe it did not Contradict their Intereſts, as it did the Intereſt of thoſe who had great Poſſeſſions. (2.) Thoſe that are poor and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy little of the good things of this Life, are willing to entertain the glad Tidings of Happineſs in another Life. Such as are in a State of miſery here, are glad to underſtand that it ſhall be well with them hereafter, and are willing to liſten to the good News of a future Happineſs; whereas the Rich who have had their Conſolation here, are not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned what will become of them hereafter.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And Bleſſed is he whoſoever ſhall not be offended in me.</p>
               <p>No doubt our Saviour uttered theſe words with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reſpect and Reference to <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, who out of an extraordinary Zeal for the honour of their Maſter were prejudiced againſt our Saviour; but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral import of the wordS doth ſhew, that there are many to whom Chriſt is a Rock of Offence; the Jews were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Meaneſs of his Extraction, at the poverty of his Parents, at the lowneſs of his Breeding, at his Suffering Condition; from their Traditions they expected the Meſſias ſhould be a Temporal Prince; whereas the Prophets decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he ſhould be a <hi>man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs;</hi> be deſpiſed, and put to Death. Thus at this day, many are offended at Chriſt: Some are offended at the aſſerted Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Perſon, and the meritoriouſneſs of his Satisfaction. Some are offended at the Sublimity of his Doctrine, others at the Sanctity and ſtrictneſs of his Laws; ſome are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the free Diſpenſation of his Grace; others, that the Terms of Chriſtianity are very hard, and lay too great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon humane Nature; <hi>But bleſſed is he</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>that ſhall not be offended in me;</hi> intimating, that ſuch, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being offended at Chriſt, do believe in him, and ground their Expectations of Heaven and Salvation wholly upon him, are in a happy and bleſſed Condition; <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall not he offended in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 And when the Meſſengers of John were departed, Jeſus began to ſpeak unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concerning John. What went ye out into the Wilderneſs to ſee? a Reed ſhaken with the wind? 25 But what went ye our for to ſee? a man cloathed in ſoft Raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeouſly apparelled, and live de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately are in King's Courts. 26 But what went ye out for to ſee? a Prophet? yea, I ſay unto you, and much more than a Prophet. 27 This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having given (as we may ſuppoſe) full Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, and ſent them away, he enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a large Commendation of <hi>John</hi> himſelf: Where we have <hi>Obſervable</hi> (1.) The Perſons whom he commended <hi>John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not his own Diſciples, but before the Multitude: for <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples had too high an Opinion of their Maſter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, inſomuch that they envied our Saviour for over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing their Maſter, <hi>John</hi> 7.26. <hi>Behold Chriſt baptizeth, and all men come unto him.</hi> It was a great Eye-ſore to <hi>John's</hi> Diſciples, that Chriſt had more hearers and followers then their Maſter; therefore not before <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Multitude is <hi>John</hi> commended; for as <hi>John</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had too high, ſo the Multitude had too low an Opinion of <hi>John;</hi> poſſibly becauſe of his Impriſonment and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: There was a time when the people had high Thoughts of <hi>John</hi>'s Perſon and Miniſtry, but being now clouded with Sufferings, they diſeſteem and under-value him. <hi>Learn</hi> hence how vain it is for any men, but eſpecially for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to value themſelves by popular applauſe: The People contemn to day, whom they admired yeſterday; he who to day is cry'd up, to morrow is trodden down; the Word and Miniſters are the ſame, but this proceeds from the fickleneſs and inconſtancy of the People; nothing is ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as the mind of Man; nothing ſo variable as the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Multitude. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Time when our Saviour thus commended <hi>John; when he was caſt into Priſon by Herod;</hi> not when he was in Proſperity, when the People flock'd after him, when he preach'd at Court, and was reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by <hi>Herod,</hi> but when the giddy Maltitude had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him; when he was diſgraced at Court, and had preach'd himſelf into a Priſon: Now it is that Chriſt proclaims his worth, maintains his honour, and tells the People, that the World was not worthy of ſuch a Preacher. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Chriſt will ever-more ſtand by, and ſtick faſt unto his Faithful Miniſters, when all the World forſakes them: Let the World ſlight and deſpiſe them at their pleaſure, yet Chriſt will maintain their Honour, and ſupport their Cauſe, as they bear a faithful Witneſs to Chriſt, ſo Chriſt will bear witneſs to their faithfulneſs for him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation it ſelf. Our Saviour commends <hi>John</hi> for four Things, for his Conſtancy, for his Sobriety, for his Humility, for his Goſpel-miniſtry, (1.) for his Conſtancy, he was not <hi>a Reed ſhaken with the Wind;</hi> that is, a Man of an unſtable and unſettled Judgment, but fixt and ſteady. (2.) For his Sobriety, Auſterity, and high Degrees of Mortification and Self-denial; he was no delicate, voluptuous Perſon, but grave, ſober, and ſevere; he was mortified to the Glory and Honour, to the Eaſe and Pleaſures of the World: <hi>John</hi> wrought no Miracles, but his Converſation was almoſt Miraculous, and as effectual as Miracles to prevail upon the People. (3.) For his Humility; <hi>John</hi> might once have been what he would, the People were ready to cry him up for the Meſſias, the Chriſt of God, but <hi>John</hi>'s humble and lowly Spirit refuſes all; <hi>He confeſſed, and denied not, ſaying, I am not the Chriſt,</hi> but a poor Miniſter of his, willing, but not worthy, to do him the meaneſt Service. This will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Miniſtry to the Conſciences of our People, when we ſeek not our own Glory but the Glory of Chriſt. (4.) Our Saviour commends <hi>John</hi> for his clear Preaching the Goſpel, and for his making known the Coming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah to the People, <hi>He was more than a Prophet,</hi> becauſe he pointed out Chriſt more clearly and fully then any of the Prophets before him: The Ancient Prophets beheld Chriſt a far off, but <hi>John</hi> ſaw him face to face. They Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy'd of him, he pointed at him; ſaying, <hi>This is he;</hi> The clearer any Miniſtry is in Diſcovering of Chriſt, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and uſeful it is.</p>
               <p n="28">28 For I ſay unto you, that amongſt thoſe that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet then John the Baptiſt; but he that is leaſt in the kingdom of God is greater then he.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having highly commended <hi>John</hi> in the former Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, here he ſets Bounds to the Honour of his Miniſtry; adding, that tho' <hi>John</hi> was greater then all the Prophets that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſeeing more of Chriſt then all them, yet he ſaw leſs then thoſe that come after him. The meaneſt Goſpel-miniſter that Preaches Chriſt as come, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:46556:91"/> all the old Prophets, who Prophecy'd of Chriſt to come. That Miniſter who ſets forth the Life, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, is greater in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is, has an higher Office in the Church, and a more excellent Miniſtry, then all the Prophets, yea, then <hi>John</hi> himſelf. The excellency of a Miniſtry conſiſts in the Light and clearneſs of it; Now tho' <hi>John</hi>'s Light did exceed all that went before him, yet it fell ſhort of them that came after him; and thus he that was leaſt in the Kingdom of Grace on Earth, much more he that is leaſt in the Kingdom of Glory in Heaven, was greater then <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 And all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being baptized with the Baptiſm of John. 30 But the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, being not baptized of him.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are our Saviour's farther Commendation of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; he tells us, that <hi>John</hi> had two ſorts of Hearers; (1.) the common People and Publicans; (2.) The Phariſees and Lawyers, and declares that different effect which <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry had upon theſe two different ſorts of Perſons. As to the former, the common People and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, the common People were accounted by the Jewiſh Doctors, as the Dregs of Mankind, an ignorant and rude <hi>Mob;</hi> the Publicans were eſteemed notoriouſly wicked, guilty of great Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, and Extortion; yet theſe vile Perſons were converted ſooner then the Knowing Men of the Time, the Self-juſtifying Phariſees and Lawyers; for it is ſaid, <hi>The Publicans were baptized of John and juſtified God;</hi> that is, they look'd upon <hi>John</hi> as a Prophet ſent of God, they owned his Miniſtry, received his Meſſage, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Baptiſm. Thoſe which believe the Meſſage that God ſendeth, and obey it, they juſtify God: They that do not believe and obey, accuſe and condemn God. But of the others it is ſaid, namely, of the Phariſees and Lawyers, That <hi>they rejected the Counſel of God against themſelves;</hi> that is, the revealed Will of God, refuſing to be Baptized of him; this rejecting the Counſel of God we are guilty of, when we have low and undervaluing thoughts of Chriſt and his Goſpel, when we are aſhamed in times of Perſecution to own and profeſs him, when we ſtop our Ears to the voice of his Miniſters and Meſſengers, when we ſubmit not our ſelves to the reaſonable Laws and Commands of Chriſt; and this Rejection of Chriſt at the Great Day, will render our Condition worſe then the Condition of Heathens, that never heard of a Saviour, then the Condition of Jews which Crucified their Saviour, yea then the Condition of Devils for whom a Saviour was never intended: Lord! Where ſhall we appear, if we either Reject or Neglect thy great Salvation.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And the Lord ſaid, whereunto ſhall I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? 32 They are like unto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and ſaying, we have piped unto you, and ye have not danced, we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. 33 For John the Baptiſt came neither eating bread, nor drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine, and ye ſay he hath a Devil. 34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking, and ye ſay behold a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners. 35 But wiſdom is juſtified all of her children.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour in theſe words, deſcribes the perverſe Humour of the Phariſees, whom nothing could allure to the embracing of the Goſpel, neither <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry nor Chriſt's. This our Saviour ſets forth two ways, allegorically and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; by way of Allegory he compares them to ſullen Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom nothing would pleaſe, neither Mirth nor Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if their fellows piped before them, they would not Dance; if they ſang mournful Songs to them they would not lament; that is, the Phariſees were of ſuch a cenſorious and capricious humour, that God himſelf could not pleaſe them; altho' he uſed variety of Means and Methods in order to that end. Next our Lord plainly interprets this Allegory, by telling them that <hi>John</hi> came to them, neither eating nor drinking; that is, not ſo freely and plentifully as other Men, being a very auſtere and mortified man, both in his Dyet and Habit, all which was deſigned by God to bring the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees to Repentance and Amendment of Life. But inſtead of this they Cenſure him for having a Devil, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Solitude, and was not ſo free in Converſation as ſome Men; according to the ancient Obſervation, <hi>that he that delighteth in Solitude, is either an Angel or a Devil,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wild Beaſt, or a God. <hi>John</hi> being thus rejected, Chriſt himſelf comes to them, who being of a free and familiar Converſation, not ſhunning the Society of the worſt of men, no not of the Phariſees themſelves, but complying with their Cuſtoms, and accompanying them innocently at their Feaſts, yet the freedom of our Saviour's Converſation diſpleas'd them, as much as <hi>John</hi>'s reſervedneſs of Temper; for they cry, <hi>Behold a man gluttonous, a friend of Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> Chriſt's Affability towards Sinners they account an Approbation of their Sins, and his Sociable Diſpoſition, Looſeneſs and Luxury. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Faithful and Zealous Miniſters of Chriſt, let their Temper and Converſe be what it will, cannot pleaſe the Enemies of Religion, and the haters of the Power of Godlineſs; neither <hi>John</hi>'s Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor Chriſt's familiarity could gain upon the Phariſees: It is the Duty of the Miniſter's of God, in the courſe of their Miniſtry to ſeek to pleaſe all Men for their good: But after all our endeavours to pleaſe all, if we ſtrenuouſly oppoſe the Errors and Vices of the Times, we ſhall pleaſe but very few. But if God and Conſcience be of the number of thoſe few, we are Safe and Happy. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) that it has been the old Policy of the Devil, that he might hinder the Succeſs of the Goſpel, to fill the minds of Perſons with an invincible Prejudice againſt the Miniſters and Diſpenſers of the Goſpel. Here the Phariſees are prejudiced unreaſonably, both againſt <hi>John,</hi> and againſt Chriſt, that the Succeſs of both their Miniſtry might be fruſtrated and diſappointed. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) That after all the ſcandalous Reproaches caſt upon the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and the Miniſters and Profeſſors of it, ſuch as are Wiſdoms Children, wiſe and good men, will juſtify Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is, approve it in their judgments, honour it in their Diſcourſes, and adorn it in their Lives; <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of all her Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36 And one of the Phariſees deſired him that he would eat with him: and he went into the Phariſees houſe and ſate down to meat. 37 And behold a woman in the city which was a ſinner, when ſhe knew that Jeſus ſate at meat in the Phariſees houſe, brought an Alablaſter Box of Oyntment. 38 And ſtood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with Tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kiſſed his feet, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with the Oyntment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Phariſees Civility and our Saviour's Courteſy, the Phariſee invites Chriſt to eat with him, Chriſt readily accepts the invitation, never refuſing any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for doing good. There is a Duty of Civil Courteſy which we owe to the worſt of Men, none are ſo bad, but we may ſoberly eat and drink with them; only let us take care, that if our Converſe do not make them better, their Example may not make us worſe. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) What an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity our Saviour lays hold upon in the Phariſees Houſe of doing good to a ſinful Woman; who coming to Chriſt bowed down in a ſorrowful ſight and ſenſe of her Sins, finds an hearty welcome to him, and is diſmiſſed with comfort from him. The Hiſtory runs thus; <hi>Behold a Woman in the City which was a ſinner,</hi> that is, a Gentile, ſay ſome, a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, notorious, and infamous Sinner, ſay others; probably a lewd, unclean woman, ſhe is led in with a note of Admiration, <hi>Behold a Woman that was a Sinner. Learn,</hi> That to ſee a ſenſual and notorious Sinner, out of true remorſe of Conſcience, to ſeek unto a Saviour, is a rare and wonderful ſight. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, it is not ſaid, Behold, a Woman that had ſinned, but <hi>Behold a Woman that was a Sinner:</hi> One Action does not denominate a Perſon a Sinner, but an habit and trade of ſin. <hi>Again,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Behold a Woman in the City,</hi> the Place where
<pb facs="tcp:46556:92"/> ſhe acted her Lewdneſs in, added to the heinouſneſs of her Sin, <hi>it was in the City;</hi> the more publick the Offence, the greater the Scandal. Sin is Sin, tho' in the Deſert, where no Eye ſees it, but the offence is aggravated by the number and multitude of Beholders: yet obſervable it is, that there is no mention made, either of the Womans Name, or of the Cities Name; and it is both Preſumption and Injuriouſneſs for any to Name her, whoſe Name God has been pleaſed to conceal; for this is not the ſame Woman that Anointed Chriſt's Feet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. and <hi>John</hi> 12. that was in <hi>Bethany,</hi> this in <hi>Galilee,</hi> that in the Houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper, this of <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3) The Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Demeanour of this poor Woman, ſhe appears in the poſture of a Penitent; <hi>ſhe ſtood at Chriſt's feet behind him, weeping.</hi> Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The great change wrought in this ſinful Woman, and the evident effects of it; her Eyes, which had been formerly Lamps of Fire by Luſt, are now an holy Fountain of penitential Tears; her Hair, which ſhe had uſed as a Net to catch her fond and fooliſh Lovers, doth now become a Towel for her Saviour's Feet. Verily ſuch an Heart as has once felt the ſting and ſmart of Sin, will make plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Expreſſions of the greatneſs of its Sorrow. Again, <hi>ſhe ſtands behind Chriſt and weeps;</hi> this proceeded, no doubt, from an holy Baſhfulneſs; ſhe that was wont to look boldly upon the Face of her Lovers, dares not now behold the Face of our Saviour; ſhe that was wont to ſend her alluring Beams forth into the Eyes of her wanton Lovers, now caſts her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Eyes down upon the Earth; and behold the plenty of her Tears; they flow in ſuch abundance, that ſhe waſhes Chriſt's feet with them; ſhe began to waſh his Feet, ſays the Text, but we read not when ſhe ended; never were our Saviour's Feet bedewed with more precious Liquor then this of Remorſeful Tears. Thus doth an Holy Penitent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no office too mean that is done to the Honour of its Saviour.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Now when the Phariſee which had bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him ſaw it, he ſpake within himſelf, ſaying, This man if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is, that toucheth him, for ſhe is a ſinner. 40 And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto him, Simon, I have ſomewhat to ſay unto thee, and he ſaith, Maſter ſay on. 41 There was a certain credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor which had two debtors, the one ought five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both: Tell me therefore, which of them will love him moſt? 43 Simon anſwered and ſaid, I ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt; and he ſaid unto him, thou haſt rightly judged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How unreaſonably the Phariſee was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with Chriſt for permitting this poor Woman to come near him, and touch him. Admit ſhe had been the greateſt of Sinners, might not ſuch come to Chriſt, when he was come from Heaven to them? Oh Bleſſed Saviour! there is Merit enough in thy Blood and Mercy, enough in thy Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to juſtify and ſave the vileſt Sinners, which by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith do make a timely Application to thee. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (2.) The Parable which Chriſt makes uſe of for the Phariſees Conviction, and the Womans Comfort; namely, the Parable of two Debtors, one of whom owed a greater Sum, and the other a leſs, who both having nothing to pay, were both freely forgiven; and both upon their Forgiveneſs loved their Creditor much, but he moſt, to whom moſt was given. Now from this Parable we gather theſe Leſſons of Inſtruction; (1.) That great is the Debt which all Mankind has Contracted, and lyes under to the juſtice of God; 'Tis here expreſt by <hi>Five hundred pence.</hi> Our Debt is infinite, and had not miraculous Mercy interpoſed, Divine Juſtice could never have been ſatisfied, but by undergoing an infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. (2.) That yet all Sinners ſtand not alike indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Juſtice of God, ſome owe more and others leſs; all are Guilty, but not all alike; Some owe Five hundred Talents, others Fifty Pence. (3.) That be Mens Debts greater or leſs, their Sins more or fewer, 'tis utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any Perſon of himſelf to clear his Debt, and make Satisfaction, but they that owe leaſt ſtand in need of mercy and forgiveneſs; <hi>He forgave them both.</hi> (4.) That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs that is in God is a free, gratuitous, and gracious Forgiveneſs, he <hi>frankly</hi> forgave them both. <hi>Gracious art thou, oh Lord, in thy doings towards thy children, and thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy is over all thy works.</hi>

               <p n="44">44 And he turned to the woman, and ſaid unto Simon, ſeeſt thou this woman: I entered into thy Houſe, and thou gaveſt me no water for my feet, but ſhe hath waſhed my feet with Tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. 45 Thou gaveſt me no kiſs, but this woman, ſince the time I came in, hath not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to kiſs my feet. 46 Mine head with Oyl thou didſt not anoint, but this woman hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed my feet with Oyntment. 47 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto her, her ſins which are many are forgiven, for ſhe loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little. 48 And he ſaid unto her, Thy ſins are forgiven. 49 And they that ſate at meat with him, began to ſay within themſelves, who is this that forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſins alſo. 50 And he ſaid unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thy faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) How our Saviour Recounts and Sums up the ſeveral particular inſtances of this Womans Love and Reſpect towards himſelf; ſhe waſh'd, wip'd, kiſt, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Feet, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Love will creep where it cannot go, it will ſtoop to the meaneſt Offices, and is ambitious of the higheſt Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for and towards the Perſon we ſincerely Love. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The words of Comfort, given by our Saviour to this poor Woman; <hi>Thy Sins, which are many, are forgiven thee.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the pardoning Mercy of God is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unlimited; it is not limited to any ſort of Sins or Sinners, it is not limited to any degree of Sins or Sinners; <hi>Thy Sins that are many are forgiven thee,</hi> and thy Sins which are heinous are forgiven alſo. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) What is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and fruit of great pardoning Mercy, it is great Love; her Sins which are many are forgiven, <hi>for ſhe loved much:</hi> Her Love to Chriſt was the effect of his pardoning Love to her, and not the Cauſe of it: She did not firſt Love much, and then Chriſt forgave her, but Chriſt firſt forgave her, and then ſhe loved much. Her Love was a Love of Gratitude, becauſe ſhe was pardoned, and not a Love of Merit to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and procure her Pardon. The Papiſts interpret this Word <hi>(For)</hi> as if it were the Antecedent Cauſe of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; whereas it is a conſequential Sign and Evidence, that the free Grace and Mercy of Chriſt had forgiven her; her many and great Sins were forgiven her, and therefore ſhe Loved much. The Debt is not Forgiven becauſe the Debtor Loves his Creditor, but the Debtor therefore Loves becauſe the Debt is Forgiven: Forgiveneſs goes before, and Love follows after. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That much Love will follow great Forgiveneſs. Love will work in the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in ſome proportion to that Love which we have Experienced from God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The very Gracious Diſmiſſion which this Woman meets with from our, Bleſſed Saviour: What could ſhe deſire that is not here granted to her? Here is Remiſſion, Safety, Faith, and Peace; all theſe here meet to make a Contrite Soul Happy: Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Ground of her Safety, Faith the Ground of her Peace, Peace the fruit of her Faith, and Salvation the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of her Remiſſion: Oh Woman! Great was thy Sin, Great was Chriſt's pardoning Grace, and Great was thy Joy and Comfort: <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven thee, thy Faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, the great work and buſineſs, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtles, but Chriſt himſelf was engaged in, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about, namely, preaching the Goſpel, thoſe glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Salvation to a loſt World. Where <hi>Note,</hi> That Chriſt himſelf labour'd in this Work of publick Preaching; he did not ſend forth his Apoſtles as his Curates to work and ſweat in the Vineyard, whilſt he himſelf took his eaſe at home; but he accompanieth them himſelf, yea, he goes before them himſelf, in this great and excellent Work; <hi>Jeſus went preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glad tidings of the Goſpel, and the twelve were with him. Learn</hi> thence, That Preaching of the Goſpel is a great and neceſſary Work, incumbent upon all the Miniſters of Chriſt, let their Dignity and Preheminence in the Church be what it will. Surely none of the Servants are above their Lord and Maſter, did he Labour in the Word and Doctrine? well may they. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The places where Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached, not only in the populous Cities, but in the poor Country Villages; <hi>They went through every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and village, preaching the Goſpel.</hi> Some will preach the Goſpel, provided they may preach at Court, or in the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cities of the Nation, but the poor Country Villages are over-look'd by them. Our Saviour and his Apoſtles were not of this mind; it's true, they were Itinerary Preachers, we are ſettled, but be the place never ſo mean and obſcure, and the People never ſo rude and barbarous, we muſt not think it beneath the greateſt of us to exerciſe our Miniſtry there, if God calls us thither, <hi>Chriſt went through the villages</hi> as well as <hi>cities, Preaching.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 And certain women which had been heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of evil Spirits, and infirmities, Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom went ſeven Devils. 3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and Suſanna, and many others, which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered unto him of their Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the number of thoſe that did Accompany our Saviour and his Apoſtles, mention is here made of certain Women who had been healed by Chriſt of Evil Spirits and Infirmities, that is, of Spiritual and Corporeal Diſeaſes, for the Jews were wont to call Vices and evil Habits, by the Name of Devils, as the Devil of Pride, the Devil of Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as concerning theſe Womens following of Chriſt, and adminiſtring to him, ſeveral Circumſtances are <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as (1.) That Women did make up a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt's Followers, ay and of his Apoſtles Followers too, <hi>the Devout Women not a few, Acts</hi> 17.4. And verily it is no Diſgrace or Shame, but matter of Glory and cauſe of Thankfulneſs, if our Miniſtry be attended by, and Bleſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the weaker Sex. I believe in many of our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at moſt of our Communions, are found two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for one Man; God grant them Knowledge anſwerable to their Zeal, and Obedience proportionable to their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) One of theſe Women that followed Chriſt, was <hi>Joanna the Wife of Herod's Steward:</hi> What one of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Family tranſplanted into Chriſt's Houſhold? oh the freeneſs of the Grace of God. Even in the worſt Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and Places, God has a number to ſtand up for his Name and bear witneſs to his Truth; we read of a <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s Court; of an <hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Court; of a <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s Court; of a Church in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Houſe; and of a <hi>Joanna</hi> here in bloody <hi>Herod</hi>'s Family, who had put <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to Death. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Holy courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of our Saviour's Female Followers; no doubt they met with Taunts and Jears, with Scofs and Scorns enough, and perhaps from their Husbands too, for following the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Son, and a few Fiſhermen; but this does not damp but inflame their Zeal: The Holy Goſpel acquaints us with ſeveral inſtances of Maſculine Courage, and manly Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Women that followed Chriſt, as his Female Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; at our Saviour's Tryal, the Women cleave to him, when his Diſciples fled from him; they accompanied him to his Croſs, they aſſiſted at his Funeral, they attended his Hearſe to the Grave, they watched his Sepulchre, fearing neither the Darkneſs of the Night, nor the rudeneſs of the Soldiers. Theſe feeble Women had more courage then all the Apoſtles. <hi>Learn</hi> that Courage is the ſpecial and peculiar Gift of God, and where he gives Courage, it is not in Man to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The pious and charitable care of theſe Holy Women, to ſupply the Wants and outward Neceſſities of our Saviour, <hi>they adminiſtred to him of their Subſtance.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The great Poverty of Chriſt, he lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Basket; he would not honour the World ſo far, as to have any part of it in his own hand, but was beholding to others for what he eat and drank; yet muſt we not ſuppoſe that either Chriſt or his Apoſtles were common Beggars, but it is probable there was a Bag or common Purſe amongſt them, which upon occaſion ſupplied their Neceſſities; and there were certain <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Siſters or Chriſtian Women, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves, who accompanied Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their Travels, and provided Neceſſaries for them, when they went up and down Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. <hi>Note</hi> alſo (2.) The condeſcending Grace and Humility of Chriſt, he was not aſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Reproach is not that they have been Sinners, for Chriſt did not give himſelf for a people that were pure and holy, without ſpot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, but to make them ſo by his Word and Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. Chriſt is only aſhamed of thoſe that eat of his Bread, and lift up the Heel againſt him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And when much people were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and were come to him out of every quarter, he ſpake by a Parable. 5 A ſower went out to ſow his Seed, and as he ſowed, ſome fell by the ways ſide, and it was trodden down, and the Fowls of the air devoured it. 6 And ſome fell upon a Rock, and as ſoon as it was ſprung up it withered away, becauſe it lacked moyſture. 7 And ſome fell among Thorns, and the Thorns ſprang up and choaked it. 8 And others fell upon good ground, and ſprang up and bear fruit a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, be cryed, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear 9 And his Diſciples asked him ſaying, What might this Parable be? 10 And he ſaid, unto you it is given to know the myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; but to others in Parables, that ſeeing they might not ſee, and hearing they might not underſtand.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this Parable is to ſhew what are the Cauſes of Mens improving or not improving under the Hearing of the Word; and to let us know that there are three ſorts of bad Hearers, and but one good one. The c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inconſiderate Hearer is like the <hi>High-way Ground,</hi> where the Seed is trodden down and trampled upon. Hard-hearted Sinners, whom the mollifying word doth not ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; Theſe are like <hi>Stony-ground,</hi> where the Seed takes no Root, the word makes no impreſſion. Thoſe whoſe heads and Hearts are ſtuft with the Cares of this World, are like the Thorny-ground, in which the Seed is choaked, which ſhould fructify to an holy immortality: This is the Scope of the Parable. Now from the Subject-matter of it, <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That by the <hi>Sower</hi> you are to underſtand Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, the Miniſters of the Goſpel. Chriſt the principal Sower, they the Subordinate Seeds-men. Chriſt Sows his own Field, they Sow his Field, he ſows his own Seed, they his Seed: Wo unto us if we ſow our own Seed and not Chriſts. <hi>Learn</hi> (2.) The <hi>Seed</hi> ſown is
<pb facs="tcp:46556:93"/> the Word of God: Fabulous Legends, and unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which the Seeds-men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Sow, theſe are not Seed but Chaff; or if Seed (for they fructify too faſt in the minds of their People) their own, not Chriſt's. Our Lord's Field muſt be all Sown with his own Seed, with no mixt Grain. <hi>Learn</hi> then, That the Word Preach'd is like the Seed Sown in the Furrows of the Field. Seed has a fructifying, growing, and encreaſing Nature; it has in it an active Principle, and will ſpring up, if not kill'd by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Injuries; ſuch a quickning Power has the Word of God to regenerate and make alive dead Souls, if we ſuffer it to take Rooting in our Hearts; yet is not this Seed alike fruitful in every Soil, all Ground is not alike, neither doth the Word fructify alike in the Souls of Men; there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both from the Nature of the Soyl, and the influence of the Spirit; for tho' no Ground is naturally good, yet ſome is worſe then other; nay even the beſt Ground doth not bring forth Encreaſe alike: Some good Ground brings forth an hundred fold, others but ſixty, and ſome but Thirty: in like manner a Chriſtian may be a profitable Hearer of the Word, altho' he doth not bring forth ſo great a Proportion of Fruit as others, provided he bring forth as much as he can.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And his Diſciples asked him, ſaying, What might this Parable be? 10 And he ſaid, To you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of God, but to others in Parables, that ſeeing they might not ſee, and hearing they might not underſtand.</p>
               <p>Here we have the Diſciples Queſtion, and our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; their enquiry is, concerning the ſenſe and ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parable, they own their Ignorance, and deſire better information: It is no ſhame for the Beſt of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yea, for the beſt of Men, to acknowledge their own ignorance in the Myſteries of Religion; and to attend upon the means of inſtruction, in order to their farther Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In our Saviour's Anſwer, <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) That the Doctrine of the Goſpel are great Myſteries; (2.) That it is an invaluable Priviledge, rightly to underſtand and know Goſpel-Myſteries. (3.) That this Priviledge all are not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in and Partakers of, but only thoſe to whom it is given. (4.) That it is a Righteous thing with God to give ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons over to farther Blindneſs and ignorance in Spiritual Things, who wilfully reject the Truth, and ſhut their eyes againſt the evidence of it. The Phariſees had all along ſhut their Eyes and ſaid, they would not ſee; and now Chriſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their Eyes Judicially, and ſays they ſhall not ſee.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Now the Parable is this, the ſeed is the word of God. 12 Thoſe by the way-ſide are they that hear, then cometh the Devil, and taketh the word out of their hearts, leſt they ſhould believe and be ſaved. 13 They on the Rock are they which hear, and receive the word with joy, and theſe have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. 14 And that which fell among Thorns, are they which when they hear the word go forth, and are choaked with cares, and riches, and pleaſures of this Life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 15 But that on the good ground, are they which in an honeſt and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour applies himſelf to interpret and explain the foregoing Parable to his Diſciples, he tells them, <hi>The Seed is the Word,</hi> the <hi>Sower</hi> is the Preacher, the Soyl, or <hi>ground,</hi> is the Heart and Soul of Man; ſome Hearers he compares to the <hi>high-way Ground,</hi> in which the Seed lies uncovered for want of the Harrow of Meditation, others to <hi>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny Ground,</hi> in which the Word has no Root; no Root in their Underſtandings, no Root in their Memories, in their Wills, or in their Affections, but they are inſtantly offended, either at the depth and profoundneſs of the Word, or at the ſanctity and ſtrictneſs of the Word, or elſe at the plainneſs and ſimplicity of it. Again, ſome Hearers our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to <hi>Thorny-ground.</hi> Worldly deſires, and inordinate cares for the things of this Life, choak the Word, as Thorns over-ſhadow the Corn, draw away the Heart of the Earth from it, hinder the influences of the Sun from cheriſhing it; the like ill effects have Worldly Affections and deſires in the Soul of Man, rendring the Seed of the Word unfruitful. But the good Chriſtian hears the Word attentively, keeps it retentively, believes it ſteadfaſtly, applies it particularly, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes it univerſally, and brings forth Fruit perſeveringly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That no Hearers are in Chriſt's Account good Hearers of the Word, but ſuch as bring forth Fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to their Hearing. (2.) That a Perſon may be a good hearer of the Word in Chriſt's Account, if he bring forth the beſt Fruit he can, tho' not in ſo great a Proportion as others do; as ſome Ground brings forth <hi>Thirty,</hi> ſome <hi>ſixty,</hi> ſome <hi>an hundred fold;</hi> in like manner do all the ſincere Hearers of the Word; they all bring forth fruit, tho' not all alike; all in ſincerity, tho' not all Equally, and none to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="16">16 No man when he hath lighted a Candle, covereth it with a Veſſel, or putteth it under a bed; but ſetteth it on a Candleſtick, that they which enter in may ſee the light. 17 For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſecret that ſhall not be made manifeſt, neither any thing hid, that ſhall not be made known, and come abroad. 18 Take heed therefore how you hear, for whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and whoſoever hath not from him ſhall be taken, even that which he ſeemeth to have.</p>
               <p>In theſe words Chriſt declares his End and Deſign in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing unto his Diſciples the foregoing Parable, and why he communicated to them the Light of Scripture, Knowledge and Goſpel Myſteries, namely, that they may communicate it to others, and not keep it cloſe unto themſelves, even as the Candle in an houſe diffuſes and diſperſes its light to all that come within the reach of it. Such as are enlightned by God in any meaſure with the Knowledge and Underſtanding of his Word, ought not to conceal and hide this Knowledge within themſelves, but Communicate it to others, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it for the good and benefit of others. <hi>Obſerve</hi> alſo the Argument which our Saviour makes uſe of to quicken his Diſciples to communicate their Knowledge, and improve the Grace they had received for the good and advantage of others; <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> that is, ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their ſpiritual Gifts, ſhall have them encreaſed, ſuch as improve them not ſhall have them blaſted. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, that there is no ſuch way to thrive in Grace, and encreaſe in Gifts as to exerciſe and improve them; he that hides his Talent, forfeits it, is in danger of looſing it, and alſo of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed for not improving of it. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, How our Lord ſhuts up this Parable of the Sower and the Seed, with a cautionary direction to all his Auditors, to take heed how they hear the Word; <hi>Take heed therefore how you hear;</hi> Such as would profit by hearing the Word, muſt diligently attend to the matter of the Doctrine which they hear, and alſo to the manner how they hear; ſuch is the majeſty and authority of the perſon that ſpeaks to us in the Word, ſuch is the ſublimity and ſpirituality of the matter, and ſo great is our danger if we miſcarry under the Word, that it nearly concerns us to take heed both what we hear, whom we hear, and how we hear.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Then came to him, his mother and his Brethren, and could not come at him for the preſs. 20 And it was told him by certain which ſaid, thy mother and thy brethren ſtand without, deſiring to ſee thee. 21 And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto them, My mother and my brethren are theſe, which hear the word of God, and do it.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:93"/>
               <p>Two things are here <hi>Obſervable</hi> (1.) The Truth and Verity of Chriſt's Humane Nature; He had affinity and conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with men, perſons near in Blood to him by the Mothers ſide, called here his Kinſmen. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) That Chriſt's Spiritual Kindred were much dearer to him, then his natural. Allyance by Faith is more valued by Chriſt then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance by Blood; to bear Chriſt in the heart, is a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then to carry him in the Womb. Bleſſed be God, this great and gracious Priviledge is not denyed us even now. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we cannot ſee Chriſt, yet love him we may; his bodily Preſence cannot be enjoy'd by us, but his ſpiritual Preſence is not denied to us: Tho' Chriſt be not ours in Houſe, in Arms, in Affinity and Conſanguinity, yet in Heart, in Faith, in Love and Service, he is or may be ours. Verily, ſpiritual Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration bringeth men into a more honourable Relation to Chriſt, then natural Generation ever did. Oh how dear are Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians to Chriſt! he prefers them in eſteem before thoſe of his own Fleſh and Blood; <hi>My brethren are theſe, which hear the word of God and do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 Now it came to paſs on a certain day, that he went into a ſhip with his Diſciples, and he ſaid unto them let us go over unto the other ſide of the Lake, and they lanched forth. 23 But as they ſailed he fell aſleep; and there came down a ſtorm of wind on the Lake, and they were filled with water, and were in jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 24 And they came to him and awoke him, ſaying, Maſter, Maſter, we periſh: Then he aroſe, and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water, and they ceaſed, and there was a calm. 25 And he ſaid unto them, where is your Faith? and they being afraid, wondered, ſaying one to another, what manner of man is this, for he commandeth even the winds and waters, and they obey him.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Our Saviour and his Diſciples no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er put forth to Sea, but difficulty attends them, and danger over-takes them: a Tempeſt aroſe, and that Ship was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Waves which Chriſt himſelf was in with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the preſence of Chriſt it ſelf doth not exempt his Diſciples and Followers from trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Here is a great Tempeſt about the Diſciples Ears, tho' Chriſt himſelf was in their Company. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture our Saviour was in, when this Tempeſt aroſe; being wearied with the Labours of the day, he was laid down to ſleep; thereby ſhewing himſelf to be truly and really Man; and that he not only took upon him the humane Nature, but the infirmities of that Nature alſo; he was ſubject to pain and wearineſs, to hunger and Thirſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Diſciples application made to Chriſt; they awake him with a ſad out-cry, <hi>Maſter, Maſter, we periſh;</hi> here was Faith mixed with Humane frailty. They believed that he could ſave them, but being aſleep they concluded he muſt be awaked before he could ſave them: Whereas, tho' his Humane nature was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, yet his Divine Nature neither ſlumbered nor ſlept. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the prevalency of Fear in a time of great and imminent Danger, tho' it may evidence weakneſs of Faith, yet is it no Evidence of a total want of Faith; in the midſt of the Diſciples fears, they believed Chriſt's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Ability to ſave them; <hi>Maſter, ſave us, we periſh. Obſ.</hi> (4.) A double rebuke given by our Saviour (1.) to the Winds, (2.) to the fears of his Diſciples; <hi>Chriſt rebuked the Winds, and inſtantly they were calm;</hi> when the Sea was as furious as a Mad Man, Chriſt with a ſingle Word calms it. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the moſt raging Winds and outragious Seas cannot ſtand before the Rebukes of Chriſt; Chriſt as God lays a Law upon the moſt Lawleſs Creatures, even when they ſeem to act moſt Lawleſly. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, Chriſt Rebukes his Diſciples fears, and their want of Faith, <hi>Why are ye fearful? where is your faith?</hi> No ſooner was the ſtorm up, but their fears were up, and their faith was down. They forgot that the Lord High Admiral of the Ocean was now on Board their Ship, and were as much over-ſet with their Boyſterous Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Ship was with tempeſtuous Winds: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly Chriſt rebukes the Tempeſt within, before he calms the Storm without; firſt he quickens their Faith, then he quiets the Seas. <hi>Note</hi> from hence, that great Faith in the Habit may appear but little in Act and Exerciſe. The Diſciples Faith in forſaking all and following Chriſt was great Faith; but in this preſent Act, their Faith was weak, thro' the prevalency of their fear: Oh the imperfect compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beſt of Saints, faith and fear will take their turns, and act their ſeveral parts whilſt we are here; ere long our fears will be vanquiſhed, and our faith ſwallowed up in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, our hope in fruition. Then ſhall we obey with vigour, praiſe with chearfulneſs, Love without meaſure, fear without Torment, Truſt without Deſpondency. Lord ſtrengthen our Faith in the Belief of this deſirable Happineſs, and ſet our Souls a longing for the full fruition, and final enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And they arrived at the Country of the Gadarens, which is over-againſt Galilee. 27 And when he went forth to Land, there met him out of the city, a certain man which had Devils long time, and wore no cloaths, neither abode in any houſe, but in the Tombes. 28 When he ſaw Jeſus, he cryed out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice ſaid, What have I to do with thee, Jeſus, thou ſon of God moſt high? I beſeech thee torment me not. 29 For he had commanded the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit to come out of the man; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it had caught him, and he was kept bound with chains, and in fetters, and he brake the bands, and was driven of the Devil into the Wilderneſs. 30 And Jeſus asked him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What is thy name? and he ſaid Legion, becauſe many Devils were entered into him. 31 And they beſought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep. 32 And there was there an herd of many Swine, feeding on the mountain, and they beſought him, that he would ſuffer them to enter into them, and he ſuffered them. 33 Then went the Devils out of the man, and entered into the Swine; and the herd ran violently down a ſteep place into the Lake, and were choaked. 34 When they that fed them, ſaw what was done, they fled and went and told it in the city, and in the country. 35 Then they went out to ſee what was done, and came to Jeſus, and found the man out of whom the Devils were departed, ſitting at the feet of Jeſus, cloathed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 36 They alſo which ſaw it told them by what means he that was poſſeſſed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils was healed. 37 Then the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Gadarenes round about beſought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear, and he went up into the Ship and returned back again. 38 Now the man out of whom the Devils were departed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him that he might be with him. 39 But Jeſus ſent him away, ſaying, Return to thine houſe, and ſhew how great things God has done for thee: and he went his way and publiſhed throughout the whole city how great things Jeſus had done unto him. 40 And it came to paſs when Jeſus was returned, the people gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him.</p>

               <p>This piece of Hiſtory gives us a very ſad Relation of a Perſon that was poſſeſſed with a Legion of Devils; we read of few, if any in the Old Teſtament that were thus poſſeſt, but of many in the New. Our Saviour came into the world to deſtroy the Works of the Devil; therefore he ſuffered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to enter ſome Humane Bodies, to ſhew his Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in caſting him out. <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) That the Evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by their Fall, loſt their Purity but not their Power; for with God's permiſſion they have Power not only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mens Bodies, and to poſſeſs them, but alſo to diſtemper their minds, and to drive them to Frenzy and Madneſs; ſuch was the deplorable Caſe here. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) That the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Evil Angels do no oftner exert their Power in doing miſchief to the Bodies and Lives of Men, is from the reſtraining Power of God; the Devil cannot do all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he would, and he ſhall not do all he can. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.)

How the Devils own Chriſt to be the Son of God, and pay unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, Worſhip and Homage to him, yielding Subjection to him as his ſlaves and vaſſals, not a free and voluntary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>They cryed out, and fell down before him, ſaying, What have we to do with thee, Jeſus, thou Son of God?</hi> where, by calling him Jeſus, they own him to be a Saviour, but none of their Saviour, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus?</hi> Oh what an uncomfortable Expreſſion is this? to own Chriſt to be a Saviour, and at the ſame time to know and declare, that he is none of our Saviour; <hi>Quid eſt Deus, ſi non ſit meus, What is God, if he be not my God?</hi> What comfort in a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if he be not my Saviour? <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.)

That there are Torments appointed to the Spiritual Nature of Evil Angels; (2.) That the Evil Angels or Devils are not ſo full of Torment as they ſhall be, altho' they are as full of ſin and diſcontent as they can be; there will be a time when their Torments ſhall be encreaſed; therefore they pray, <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us not before the time;</hi> that is, do not encreaſe our Torments before the appointed time of their Encreaſe. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (7.) The Devils Requeſt for Permiſſion and Leave to go into the Herd of Swine. Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.)

How Satans requeſt is yielded to by our Saviour, <hi>He ſuffered them to go</hi> into the Swine, not to gratify their deſire in doing miſchief, but firſt hereby Chriſt ſhewed his Power over the Devils, that they could not Act without his Permiſſion and Leave; next to ſhew how great the malice and power of the Devil is, if not reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Laſtly, That the Miracle of caſting out ſo many Devils might appear to be the greater. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſometimes Almighty God for wiſe Ends, and juſt Cauſes, doth ſuffer the Devil to enjoy his Deſire, in doing miſchief unto the Creatures; <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them go. Obſerve</hi> (9.) What a bad effect this Miracle had upon the Minds of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> inſtead of Believing and owning Chriſt's Divine Power, the loſs of their Swine enrages them, and makes them deſire Chriſt's departure from them. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Carnal Hearts prefer their Swine before their Saviour, and had rather loſe Chriſt's Preſence then their Worldly Profit; <hi>They beſought him to depart from them:</hi> Sad is the condition of thoſe from whom Chriſt departs, more ſad the Condition of ſuch who ſay unto Chriſt depart, but moſt ſad the condition of them who beſeech and intreat Chriſt to depart from them; thus did the <hi>Gadarens</hi> here, and we do not read that ever Chriſt returned more to them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (10.) How deſirous the poſſeſſed Man was to continue with Chriſt after he was come to himſelf, <hi>He prayed that he might be with him:</hi> This he might deſire, partly to teſtify his Thankfulneſs to Chriſt, partly out of fear of being Repoſſeſſed again by Satan, or perhaps to have the opportunity of hearing Chriſt's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and ſeeing his Miracles; for ſuch as have once taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Lord is Gracious, and experienced the pleaſure and profit of Chriſt's Company, are very deſirous of the continuance of it, and exceeding loth to part with it. However our Saviour at this time did not think fit to ſuffer him, knowing that more Glory would redound to God by publiſhing this Miracle to his Friends. Chriſt expects after eminent Deliverances wrought for us, that we ſhould be the publiſhers of his Praiſes, and declare to all, far and near, the great and wonderful things which he has done for us.</p>

Our Saviour's ſeaſonable Word of Advice and Comfort, <hi>fear not, only believe.</hi> Chriſt ſtands ready to comfort Believers in the Hour of their greateſt Tryals and Temptations. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Chriſt's Application of himſelf in order to the raiſing unto Life <hi>Jairus</hi> his dead Daughter. And here (1.) he goes into the houſe only with three of his Diſciples, and the Father and Mother of the Maid, which were ſufficient to bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truth of the Miracle. Our Saviour to avoid all ſhew of vain Glory, would not work this Miracle publickly, before all the People. (2.) Our Saviour rebukes them for the ſhew they made of immoderate Grief and Sorrow for the dead Damſel; they wept and wailed greatly, with Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels making a noiſe, ſay the other Evangeliſts; according to the Cuſtom of the Heathens, who by a mournful ſort of Muſick did ſeek to ſtir up the paſſion of Grief at their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. To mourn immoderately for the Dead is an Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Cuſtom and Practice; 'tis hurtful to the Living, 'tis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to the Dead, nor is it an Argument of more Love, but an Evidence of leſs Grace. (3.) Chriſt adds a Reaſon for this Rebuke given by him, <hi>for the Damſel is not dead, but ſleepeth; Vobis mortua, mihi dormit, She is dead to you, but aſleep to me;</hi> not ſo dead as to be beyond my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to raiſe her to Life. Souls Departed are under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Angels to their ſeveral Regions of Bliſs or Miſery; It is very probable, That the Soul of this Damſel was under the Guard of Angels, near her Dead Body, waiting the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God in order to its Diſpoſal, either to reſtore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Body, or to tranſlate it to its Eternal Manſion. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, the Nature of Death in General, and of the Saints Death in particular; 'tis a Sleep. Sleep is a ſtate of Reſt, ſleep is a ſudden ſurpriſal, in ſleep there is an inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſage of our Time; the perſon ſleeping ſhall certainly Awake. Oh how much is it our Wiſdom to prepare for the Bed of the Grave; and ſo to live, that when we lye down in it, there may be nothing to diſturb our Reſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with what facility and eaſe our Saviour Raiſes the dead Damſel? with a word ſpeaking; and St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us what the word was, <hi>Talitha Cumi,</hi> Syriack words, to ſhew the Truth of the Miracle; not like a Conjurer, muttering a Charm in an unknown Tongue. The Miracles which Chriſt wrought were real Miracles, and carried their own Evidence along with them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The charge given by our Saviour not to publiſh this Miracle; he charged them to tell no Man what was done, that is, Divulge it not imprudently to ſuch of the Scribes and Phariſees as would not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by it, but only cavil at it, and be the more enraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for it, and ſeek his Death before his appointed time was come. Again, tell it to no man unſeaſonably, and all at once, but gradually and by degrees: For it was the Will of God, that the Divine Glory of Chriſt ſhould not be manifeſted to the World all at once, and on the ſudden, but by little and little, during his eſtate of Humiliation; for his Reſurrection was the time appointed by God for the full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Chriſt's Godhead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Declared to be the Son of God with power, by the Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi>

               <p>We heard before, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6.13. of our Saviour's chooſing his Twelve Apoſtles, and their ſeveral Names; they were firſt choſen Diſciples, to be with Chriſt, to learn of him, and be inſtructed by him, and to be Witneſſes of what he ſaid and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:95"/> did: Now after ſome time thus ſpent in preparing and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them for publick Service, our Saviour ſends them forth to preach the Goſpel, and gives them a power to confirm their Doctrine by Miracles. <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) The Perſon that ſends the Apoſtles forth to preach the Goſpel, it is Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, that none ought to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Office of Preaching, or any other Miniſterial Function in the Church, till thereunto called by Chriſt him-himſelf. The Apoſtles were called by Chriſt, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent forth by himſelf. The Miniſters of the Goſpel now are called mediately, and receive Authority from Chriſt, by the hand of the Governours of the Church. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Power given to the Apoſtles by our Saviour to Work Miracles, for confirming that Doctrine which they preached, <hi>He gave them power over unclean Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. Now this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Power given to the Apoſtles was neceſſary, partly to procure Reverence to their Perſons, being poor and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men; but principally to gain Credit and Authority to their Doctrine; for the Doctrine of Faith in the Meſſiah as now come, and exhibited in the Fleſh, being a ſtrange and new Doctrine to the Jews, the truth and certainty of it was to be extraordinarily ratified by Miracles, which are the Broad Seal of Heaven, to teſtify that ſuch a Doctrine comes from God. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The charge here given by Chriſt to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles at the time of their ſending forth, and this is Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Firſt, touching their preparation for their Journey, he forbids them to take much care, or to ſpend much time in furniſhing themſelves with Victuals, Money, or Cloaths; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were to finiſh their Journey ſpeedily, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to Chriſt their Maſter. This command of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Apoſtles, not to incumber themſelves when go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Teaches</hi> his Miniſters their Duty, to free themſelves as much as poſſibly they can, from Worldly incumbrances, which may hinder them in their miniſterial Services, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>No man that warreth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelf with the affairs of this Life.</hi> Secondly, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lodging in their Journey, Chriſt adviſes them not to change it, during their ſtay in one place: <hi>But into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever houſe they entered, they ſhould there continue, till they departed out of that place,</hi> that ſo they might avoid all ſhew of lightneſs and inconſtancy, and teſtify all gravity and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in their behaviour; this being a ſpecial means to gain reverence to their Perſons, and Authority to their Doctrine. Thirdly, Chriſt gives a ſpecial Charge to his Apoſtles concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Carriage towards ſuch as ſhould refuſe to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to them and their Doctrine, they were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Judgments of God againſt ſuch Contemners, by <hi>ſhaking off the duſt of their feet for a Teſtimony againſt them;</hi> This Action was Emblematical, ſignifying that Almighty God would in like manner ſhake them off, as the vileſt Duſt, for wherever the Word is Preached, it is for a Teſtimony, either a Teſtimony for, or againſt a people; for if the duſt of a Miniſters feet whilſt alive, and the aſhes of his Grave when dead, do bear Witneſs againſt the Deſpiſers of the Goſpel, their Sermons much more.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was done by him, and he was perplexed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it was ſaid of ſome that John was riſen from the Dead. 8 And of ſome, that Elias had appeared, and of others, that one of the old Prophets was riſen again. 9 And Herod ſaid, John have I beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear ſuch things? and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee him.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of the Holy Baptiſt's Beheading by <hi>Herod,</hi> is briefly here hinted at by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> but not largely ſet forth by him, as we find it by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ch. 14. and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> ch. 6. See the <hi>Notes</hi> there. That which St. <hi>Luke</hi> takes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of, is, that great perplexity of mind, which <hi>Herod</hi>'s guilty Conſcience did occaſion; he had murthered <hi>John,</hi> and now is afraid his Ghoſt haunted him: <hi>Herod was perplexed. Learn</hi> hence, That Guilt is naturally troubleſome and uneaſy, it diſturbs the peace and ſerenity of the mind, and fills the Soul with Storms and Thunder. Guilt is always full of fear, every thing affrights the Guilty, a bad man is a terror to himſelf, and needs no farther Diſquietment, then what his own Guilty Conſcience doth occaſion him.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And the Apoſtles when they were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, told him all they had done; and he took them, and went aſide privately into a deſert-place, belonging to a city called Bethſaida. 11 And the people when they knew it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and he received them, and ſpake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> here gives a ſhort account of ſeveral material paſſages; as (1.) concerning the Apoſtles return to Chriſt after their firſt miſſion and ſending forth; they acquaint their Maſter, how they had executed their Office, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Truſt he had repoſed in them. (2.) He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws privately into a deſert place, from the multitude, that he might enjoy himſelf and his Diſciples; but there the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple find him out, and flock after him; and Chriſt whoſe Meat it was by day, and ſleep by Night to do good, embraces the opportunity, beſtowing upon their Souls inſtruction, Reproof and Counſel, upon their Bodies health and healing, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by his example to mix Spiritual Alms with Bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, we muſt be in fee with the Body ſometimes, that we may come at the Soul. Happy is that Chriſtian whom God has made both able and willing to intermix Spiritual Alms with Corporal, and knows how to feed two at once, Soul and Body both. This is the Duty of all, but eſpecially of Spiritual Perſons, the Lord give us Wiſdom and Grace to manage it to advantage.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the Twelve, and ſaid unto him, ſend the multitude away, that they may go into the Towns and Country round about, and lodge and get Victuals, for we are here in a deſert-place. 13 But he ſaid unto them, give ye them to eat; and they ſaid, we have no more but five Loaves and two Fiſhes, except we ſhould go, and buy meat for all this people. 14 For they were about five thouſand men, and he ſaid to his Diſciples, make them ſit down by fifties in a Company. 15 And they did ſo, and made them all ſit down. 16 Then he took the five Loaves and the two fiſhes, and looking up to Heaven he bleſſed them, and brake, and gave to the Diſciples to ſet before the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. 17 And they did eat, and were all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and there was taken up of Fragments that remained to them, Twelve Baskets full.</p>
               <p>This Miracle of our Saviour's feeding five Thouſand, with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, is Recorded by all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and in the Hiſtory of it we have theſe <hi>Obſervable</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, (1.) The ſeaſonable expreſſion of the Diſciples pity towards the Multitude, who had long faſted, and wanted now the ordinary comforts and ſupports of Life; it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Miniſters of Chriſt to have reſpect to the bodily wants, as well as to the Spiritual Neceſſities of their people. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The motion which the Diſciples make to Chriſt on the Behalf of the multitude, <hi>Send them away, that they may go into the Towns and Country, and get Victuals:</hi> Here was a ſtrong Charity, but a weak Faith; a ſtrong Charity in deſiring the Peoples Relief, but a weak Faith in ſuppoſing that they could no other way be relieved, but by ſending them away; forgetting that Chriſt who had healed the multitude Miraculouſly, could alſo feed them miraculouſly whenever he pleaſed; all things being equally eaſy to an Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Our Saviour's ſtrange Reply to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Requeſt, <hi>They need not depart, give ye them to eat;</hi> need not depart? why? the People muſt either feed or famiſh, Victuals they muſt have, and a dry Deſert will afford none, yet ſays Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Give ye them to eat.</hi> Alas! poor Diſciples they had nothing for themſelves to eat, how then ſhould they give the Multitude to eat; when Chriſt requires of us what we of our ſelves are unable to perform, it is to diſcover to us our own impotency and weakneſs, to provoke
<pb facs="tcp:46556:95"/> us to look up to him, and to depend by Faith on his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (4.) What a poor and ſlender Proviſion the Lord of the whole Earth has for himſelf and his Family, <hi>Five Barley-loaves, and two Fiſhes;</hi> teaching us, that theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ours muſt be fed, but not pamper'd: Our Belly muſt not be our Maſter, much leſs our God. The end of Food is to ſuſtain Nature, we muſt not ſtifle her with a Gluttonous variety. And as the quality of the Victuals was plain, ſo the quantity of it was ſmall, <hi>Five</hi> Loaves and <hi>two</hi> Fiſhes; well might the Diſciples ſay, <hi>What are theſe among ſo many?</hi> The eye of Senſe and Reaſon ſees an utter impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of thoſe effects which Faith can eaſily apprehend, and a Divine Power more eaſily produce. <hi>Obſerve.</hi> (5.) How Chriſt the great Maſter of the Feaſt doth marſhal his Gueſts, <hi>He commands them all to ſit down by fifties in a Company.</hi> None of them reply, ſit down, but to what? Here are the mouths, but where's the meat? we may ſoon be ſet, but whence ſhall we be ſerved? not a word like this, but they obey and expect. Lord! how eaſy is it to truſt thy Providence, and rely upon thy Power, when there is Corn in the Barn, Bread in the Cup-board, Money in the Purſe. But when our ſtores are empty, when we have nothing in hand, then to depend upon an Inviſible Bounty, is a Noble Act of Faith indeed. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (6.) The Actions performed by our Bleſſed Saviour, he <hi>Bleſſed, and Brake, and gave the Loaves to his Diſciples, and they to the multitude.</hi> (1.) <hi>He Bleſſed them,</hi> teaching us, by his Example, never to uſe or receive the good Creatures of God, without Prayer and Praiſe; never to ſit down to our Food, as a Beaſt to his Fodder. (2.) Chriſt <hi>Brake</hi> the Loaves; he could have multiplied them whole, why then would he rather do it in the breaking? perhaps to teach us, that we may rather expect his Bleſſing in the Diſtribution of his Bounty, then in the Reſervation of it. Scattering is the way to encreaſing, Liberality is the way to Riches. (3.) Chriſt gave the Loaves thus broken to the Diſciples, that they might diſtribute to the Multitude; but why did Chriſt diſtribute by the Diſciples hands? doubtleſs to gain reſpect to his Diſciples from the People; and the ſame courſe doth our Lord take in ſpiritual Diſtributions: He that could feed the World by his own immediate hand, chooſes rather by the hand of his Miniſters to divide the Bread of Life amongſt his People. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (7.) The certainty and greatneſs of the Miracle, <hi>They did all eat, and were filled;</hi> They did all eat, not a crum or a bit, but to ſatiety and fulneſs, all that were hungry did eat, and all that did eat were ſatisfied; and yet <hi>Twelve Baskets of fragments remain;</hi> more is left then was at firſt ſet on. 'Tis hard to ſay which was the greateſt Miracle, the miraculous eating, or miraculous Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. If we conſider what they left, we may wonder that they eat any thing; if what they eat, that they left any thing. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, Theſe Fragments, tho' of Barley-Loaves and Fiſh-bones, muſt not be loſt, but at our Saviour's Command gathered up; the Great Houſe-keeper of the World will not allow the loſs of his Orts. Lord! how tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous will their Accounts be, who having large and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Eſtates, do conſume them upon their Luſts; How will they wiſh they had been born to poverty and Want, when they appear to make up their accounts before God.</p>
               <p n="18">18 And it came to paſs as he was alone, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Diſciples were with him, and he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, ſaying, whom ſay the people that I am. 19 They anſwering ſaid, John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; but ſome ſay Elias, and others ſay, that one of the old Prophets is riſen again. 20 He ſaid unto them, But whom ſay ye that I am? Peter anſwering ſaid, The Chriſt of God. 21 And he ſtraitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that ſaying. 22 For the Son of man muſt ſuffer many things, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of the Elders, and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be ſlain, and be raiſed the third day.</p>
               <p>Theſe Verſes relate to us a private Conference which our Saviour had with his Diſciples, touching their own and others Opinion concerning himſelf. Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's inquiry, What the generality of the People thought and ſaid of him, <hi>Whom do men ſay that I am?</hi> not as if Chriſt were ignorant, or did vain-gloriouſly inquire after the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Multitude. But his intention and deſign was to ſettle and more firmly eſtabliſh his Diſciples in the Belief of his being the True and Promiſed Meſſias. The Diſciples tell him, ſome took him to be <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>ſome Elias, ſome one of the Prophets.</hi> 'Tis no new thing it ſeems, to find Diverſity of Judgments and Opinions, concerning Chriſt and the affairs of his Kingdom. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) <hi>Peter</hi> as the Mouth of all the Apoſtles, and in their Names makes a full and open Confeſſion of Chriſt, acknowledging him to be the True and Promiſed Meſſias; <hi>Thou art the Chriſt of God. Learn</hi> thence, That the vail of Chriſt's Humane Nature, did not keep the Eye of his Diſciples Faith from diſcerning him to be Truly and Really God. <hi>Thou art the Chriſt of God. Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Charge and ſpecial Injunction given by Chriſt, <hi>To tell no man of him;</hi> that is, not commonly to Publiſh, and openly to declare him to be the Son of God; becauſe being in his State of Humiliation, the Glory of his Divinity was to be concealed till his Reſurrection; <hi>He was then declared to be the Son of God with power,</hi> Rom. 1.4. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The great Wiſdom of our Saviour in acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Diſciples with the near approach of his Death and Sufferings; <hi>The Son of Man muſt ſuffer many things,</hi> &amp;c. This our Saviour did (1.) To prevent that Scandal and Offence which otherwiſe they might have taken at his Sufferings. (2.) The better to fit and prepare them to bear that great Tryal when it did come. (3.) To correct the Error which they had entertained concerning the Temporal Kingdom of the Meſſias, and that he was to be a great and mighty Prince here upon Earth, for theſe Reaſons did Chriſt frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Diſciples with his Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And he ſaid to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me. 24 For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will loſe his Life for my ſake, the ſame ſhall find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How our Saviour recommends his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to every Perſons Election and Choice, not compelling any one by force and Violence to embrace or entertain it: <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple,</hi> that is, if any Man chooſes and reſolves to be a Chriſtian. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) Our Saviour's Terms propounded, namely, Self-denial, Goſpel-ſuffering, and Goſpel-ſervice. (1.) <hi>Self-denial, Let him deny himſelf;</hi> by which we are not to underſtand either the denying of our Senſes in matters of Faith, or the Renouncing of our Reaſon in matters of Religion; but a willingneſs to part with all our Earthly Comforts and Temporal Enjoyments for the ſake of Chriſt, when called thereunto. (2.) <hi>Goſpel-ſuffering,</hi> He muſt take up his Croſs daily; an alluſion to a <hi>Roman</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, when a Malefactor was to be Crucified, he took his Croſs up upon his Shoulder, and carried it to the place of Execution. Here <hi>Note,</hi> That not the making of the Croſs, but patient bearing of it, when God has made it, and laid it upon our Shoulder, is the Duty injoin'd; <hi>Let him take up his Croſs.</hi> (3.) <hi>Goſpel-ſervice, Let him follow me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, that is, obey my Commands, and imitate my Example, he muſt ſet my Life and Doctrine continually before him, and be daily Correcting and Reforming of his Life by that Rule and Pattern. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Arguments urged by our Saviour to induce Men to a willingneſs to lay down their Lives for the ſake of Chriſt and his Holy Religion; <hi>He that will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it, and he that is willing to loſe his Life for the ſake of the Goſpel, he ſhall find it;</hi> intimating to us, (1.) That the Love of this Temporal Life is a great Temptation to men to deny Chriſt, and to renounce his Holy Religion. (2.) That the ſureſt way to attain Eternal Life, is cheerfully to lay down our Temporal Life, when the Glory of Chriſt, and the Honour of Religion requires it at our hands.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:46556:96"/>
               <p>Here our Saviour goes on to ſhew the Folly of thoſe that for ſaving their Temporal Lives, will expoſe their Eternal Life, or the Life of their Souls to hazard and danger; yea ſometimes by refuſing to lay down our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life for Chriſt, we loſe that alſo; which renders it the greateſt folly in the World to refuſe to part with any enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even Life it ſelf, at the Call and Command of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="26">26 For whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he ſhall come in his own Glory, and in his Fathers, and of the Holy Angels.</p>
               <p>That is, whoſoever ſhall deny and diſown me, either in my Perſon, in my Doctrine, or my Members, for any fear or favour of Man, he ſhall with ſhame be diſowned by me, and rejected of me, at the Great Day. There are two Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which cauſe Men to diſown Chriſt in the day of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, namely, fear and ſhame. Many good Men have been over-come by the former, as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and others; but we find not any good Man in Scripture guilty of the latter, namely, that denied Chriſt out of ſhame; this argues a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, unſound, and corrupt Heart: If any Man thinks it beneath his Honour and Quality to own the oppoſed Truths, and deſpiſed Members of Chriſt, Chriſt will think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him to own ſuch Perſons at the Great Day. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That ſuch as are aſhamed of Chriſt's Doctrine, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are in God's Account aſhamed of Chriſt himſelf. (2.) That ſuch as either for fear dare not, or for ſhame will not, own the Doctrine and Members of Chriſt now, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find Chriſt aſhamed to own and confeſs them at the Great Day.</p>
               <p n="27">27 But I tell you of a truth, there be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not taſte of Death, till they ſee the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>There is a Threefold ſenſe and interpretation of theſe Words given by Expoſitors; (1.) Some refer the Words to the Times of the Goſpel after Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, when the Goſpel was Propagated far and near, and the Kingdom of God came with Power. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That where the Goſpel is powerfully preached, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey'd, there Chriſt cometh moſt gloriouſly in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. (2.) Others underſtand theſe Words of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exerciſing his Kingly Power in the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſome of the Apoſtles then ſtanding by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſee. (3.) Others (as moſt agreeable to the Context) underſtand the words with Reference to our Saviour's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Some of you,</hi> meaning <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſhall ſhortly ſee me upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and that in ſuch ſplendour and Glory, as ſhall be a Preludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, a ſhadow and Repreſentation of that Glory which I ſhall appear in, when I ſhall come with Power to judge the World at the great Day. And whereas our Saviour ſaith not, there are ſome ſtanding here which ſhall not dye, but <hi>which ſhall not taſte of Death,</hi> till they had ſeen this glorious ſight; This implies two things, (1.) That after they had ſeen this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, they muſt taſte of Death as well as others; (2.) That they ſhould but taſte of it, and no more. From whence <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That the moſt Renowned Servants of Chriſt, for Faith, Holineſs, and Service, muſt at length, in God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, taſte and have experience of Death as well as others. (2.) That altho' they muſt taſte, yet they ſhall but taſte of Death, they ſhall not drink off the Dregs of that bitter cup, tho' they fall by the hand of Death, yet ſhall they not be hurt by it, but in the very fall be victorious over it.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And it came to paſs about eight days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe ſayings, he took Peter, and John, and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. 29 And as he prayed, the faſhion of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was altered, and his Raiment was white as Snow, and gliſtering. 30 And behold there talked with him two men, which were Moſes and Elias. 31 Who appeared in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſpake of his Deceaſe which he ſhould accompliſh at Jeruſalem. 32 But Peter, and they that were with him, were heavy with ſleep; and when they were awake, they ſaw his Glory, and the two men that ſtood with him. 33 And it came to paſs as they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, Peter ſaid unto Jeſus, Maſter, it is good for us to be here, let us make three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias, not knowing what he ſaid. 34 While he thus ſpake, there came a cloud and over-ſhadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 35 And there came a Voice out of the cloud, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, hear him. 36 And when the voice was paſt, Jeſus was found alone; and and they kept it cloſe, and told no man in thoſe days, any of thoſe things which they had ſeen.</p>
               <p>Here we have Recorded the Hiſtory of our Holy Saviour's Transfiguration; when he laid, as it were, the Garments of our frail Humanity aſide for a little Seaſon; and put on the Robes of his Divine Glory, to Demonſtrate and Teſtify the Truth of his Divinity; for this Divine Glory was an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Divine Nature, and alſo an Emblem of that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he and his Diſciples, and all his Faithful Servants and Followers, ſhall enjoy together in Heaven. <hi>Obſerve</hi> then (1.) The deſign of our Saviour in this his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, namely, to confirm his Diſciples Faith in the Truth of his Divine Nature; he was therefore pleaſed to ſuffer the Rays of his Divinity to dart forth before their Eyes, ſo far as they were able to bear it; his Face ſhined with a pleaſing Brightneſs, and his Raiment with ſuch a Glorious Luſtre, as did at once both delight and dazzle the Eyes of his Diſciples. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The choice which our Saviour makes of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Transfiguration, his three Diſciples, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> But why Diſciples? why three Diſciples? and why theſe three? (1.) Why Diſciples? Becauſe this Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration was a Type of Heaven; Chriſt vouchſafes therefore the Earneſt and Firſt-fruits of that Glory only to Saints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, on whom he intended to beſtow the full Crop in due time. (2.) Why three Diſciples? Becauſe three were ſufficient to Witneſs the Truth of this Miracle; <hi>Judas</hi> was unworthy of this Favour, yet leſt he ſhould murmure or be diſcontented, others are left out as well as he. (3.) But why theſe three rather then others? probably, (1.) Becauſe theſe three were more eminent for great Zeal and Love towards Chriſt; now the moſt eminent Manifeſtations of Glory are made to thoſe that are moſt excelling in Grace. (2.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe three Diſciples were to be Witneſſes of Chriſt's Agony and Paſſion, to prepare them for which, they are here made Witneſſes of his Transfiguration. This Glorious Viſion upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> fitted them to abide the Terrour of Mount <hi>Calvary. Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Glorious Attendants upon our Saviour at his Transfiguration; they were Two, thoſe Two, Two Men, thoſe Two Men <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> This being but a Glimpſe of Heavens Glory, and not a full Manifeſtation of it, only Two of the Glorified Saints attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and theſe two Attendants are not two Angels, but two Men; becauſe Men were more nearly concerned then Angels in what was done, But why <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> rather then any other Men? (1.) Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was the giver of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> the chief of the Prophets; now both theſe attending upon Chriſt, did ſhew the Conſent of the Law and the Prophets with Chriſt, and their accompliſhment and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling in him. (2.) Becauſe theſe two Men were the moſt Laborious Servants of Chriſt; both adventured their Lives in God's Cauſe, and therefore were highly honoured by him; for thoſe that honour him he will honour. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Carriage and Behaviour of the Diſciples upon this great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, (1.) They ſupplicate <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they do not pray to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> but to Chriſt, <hi>Master, it is good being here:</hi> Oh what a raviſhing Comfort and Satisfaction is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Fellowſhip of the Saints; but the Preſence of Chriſt amongſt them, renders their Joys Tranſporting. (2.) They proffer their Service to farther the Continuance of what they
<pb facs="tcp:46556:96"/> did enjoy; <hi>Let us make three Tabernacles;</hi> Saints will ſtick at no coſt or pains for the Enjoyment of Chriſt's Preſence and his Peoples Company. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That a Glimpſe of Heavens Glory, is ſufficient to wrap a Soul into Extaſy, and to make it out of Love with Worldly Company. (2.) That we are apt to deſire more of Heaven upon Earth then God will allow us; we would have the Heavenly Glory come down to us, but are not willing by Death to go up to that. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (5.) How a Cloud was put before the Diſciples Eyes, when the Divine Glory was manifeſted to them; partly to allay the Luſtre and Reſplendency of that Glory, which they were ſwallowed up with; the Glory of Heaven is inſupportable in this imperfect State, we cannot bear it unvailed; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did this Cloud come to hinder their looking and prying farther into this Glory: we muſt be content to behold God thro' a Cloud darkly here, e're long we ſhall ſee him Face to Face. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (6.) The Teſtimony given out of the Cloud by God the Father, concerning Jeſus Chriſt his Son; <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi> Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The Dignity of his Perſon, he <hi>is my Son,</hi> for Nature Co-eſſential, and for Time Co-eternal with his Father. (2.) The endearedneſs of his Relation, <hi>He is my beloved Son,</hi> becauſe of his Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to me, and Compliance with me; Likeneſs is the Cauſe of Love, and an Union and Harmony of Wills cauſes a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual endearing of Affections. (3.) The Authority of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Hear ye him;</hi> Not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> who were Servants, but Chriſt my Son, whom I have authorized and appointed to be the great Prophet and Teacher of my Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Adore him as my Son, believe in him as your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and hear him as your Law-giver. The Obedient Ear honours Chriſt more, then either the gazing Eye, the adoring Knee, or the applauding Tongue.</p>
               <p n="37">37 And it came to paſs, that on the next day, when they were come down from the Hill much people met him. 38 And behold, a man of the company cryed out, ſaying, Maſter, I beſeech thee look upon my Son, for he is mine only child. 39 And lo, a Spirit taketh him, and he ſuddenly cryeth out, and it teareth him, that he foameth again, and bruiſing him, hardly departeth from him. 40 And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought thy Diſciples to caſt him out, and they could not. 41 And Jeſus anſwering ſaid, oh faithleſs and perverſe Generation, how long ſhall I be with you, and ſuffer you? Bring thy Son hither. 42 And as he was yet a coming, the Devil threw him down, and tare him, and Jeſus rebuked the unclean Spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him to his Father.</p>
               <p>Obſerve here (1.) The Perſon brought to Chriſt for help and healing, one Bodily poſſeſt by Satan, who Rent and Tore him, but rather to Torment than to Diſpatch him: Oh how does Satan delight to do hurt to the Bodies, as well as the Souls of Mankind! Lord! abate his Power, ſince his Malice will not be abated. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Perſon who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented his ſad Condition to our Saviour; his Compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Father, who kneeled down, and cryed out. Need will make a Perſon both humble and Eloquent; every one has a Tongue to ſpeak for himſelf, happy he that keeps a Tongue for others. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Phyſicians which this Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Perſon is brought unto, firſt <hi>to the Diſciples,</hi> and then to Jeſus: We never apply our ſelves importunately to the God of power, till we deſpair of the Creatures help. But what hindered the Diſciples that they could not caſt this Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out? why it was their unbelief; <hi>oh faithleſs Generation. Learn</hi> thence, That the great Obſtacle and Obſtruction of all Bleſſings both Spiritual and Temporal, coming to us, is our wretched Infidelity and Unbelief. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, and abſolute Authority which Chriſt had when on Earth, over the Devil and his Angels; <hi>Jeſus rebuked him, caſt him out, and charged him to return no more into him.</hi> This was a Proof and Demonſtration of the Godhead of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that in his own Name, that is, by his own Power and Authority, he did and could caſt the Devils out.</p>
               <p n="43">43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God; But while they wondered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one at all things which Jeſus did, he ſaith unto his Diſciples. 44 Let theſe ſayings ſink down into your ears; for the Son of man ſhall be delivered into the hands of men. 45 But they underſtood not this ſaying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not; and they feared to ask him of that ſaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſervable</hi> it is, how frequently our Saviour fore-warned his Diſciples of his approaching Sufferings, and as the time of his Sufferings drew nearer, he did more frequently warn them of his Death. But all was little enough to arm them againſt the Scandal of the Croſs; and to Reconcile them to the thoughts of his Suffering Condition; how an ordinary Prophet ſhould be Delivered into the hands of Men, they could eaſily underſtand, but how the Meſſias ſhould be ſo treated they could not apprehend; for the Diſciples had taken up the Common Opinion, That the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as was to be a Temporal Prince, and ſhould Conquer and Reign here upon Earth, and how to Reconcile this with being killed, they could no ways apprehend; and they were afraid to be too particular in their Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about it. Now from Chriſt's ſo frequent warning his Diſciples of his approaching Sufferings we may gather, That we can never hear, either too often or too much, of the Doctrine of the Croſs, nor be too frequently inſtructed in our Duty to prepare for a Suffering State; as Chriſt went from his Croſs to the Crown, from a State of Abaſement to a State of Exaltation, ſo muſt all his Diſciples and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="46">46 Then there aroſe a Reaſoning among them, which of them ſhould be the greateſt. 47 And Jeſus perceiving the thoughts of their Heart, took a child and ſet him by him. 48 And ſaid unto them, whoſoever ſhall receive this child in my name, receiveth me, and whoſoever ſhall receive me, receiveth him that ſent me; for he that is leaſt among you all, the ſame ſhall be great.</p>
               <p>It may juſtly ſeem a wonder, that when our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Diſcourſed ſo frequently with his Diſciples about his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that they ſhould at the ſame time be diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves about precedency and preheminency, which of them ſhould be the greateſt, the firſt in place, and the higheſt in Dignity and Honour: But from this Inſtance we may <hi>Learn,</hi> That the Holieſt and Beſt of Men are too prone to Ambition, ready to catch at the Bait of Honour, to affect a Precedency before, and Superiority over others; Here the Apoſtles themſelves were touch'd with the Itch of Ambition; to cure this, our Saviour ſets before them a little Child, as the proper Emblem of Humility; ſhewing that they ought to be as free from Pride and Ambition as a young Child, which affects nothing of Precedency. Such as are of higheſt Eminency in the Church ought to be ſingularly adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Grace of Humility, looking upon themſelves as lying under the greateſt Obligations to be moſt Eminently uſeful and ſerviceable for the Churches good.</p>
               <p n="49">49 And John anſwered, and ſaid, Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out Devils in thy name, and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not with us. 50 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, forbid him not, for he that is not againſt us, is for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) St. <hi>John</hi>'s Relation of a matter of Fact to our Saviour, namely, his Forbidding one to caſt out Devils in Chriſt's Name, that did not follow Chriſt as they did; for tho' only the Diſciples which followed Chriſt had a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to work Miracles; yet were there others, no Enemies to Chriſt, who in imitation of the Diſciples, did attempt to
<pb facs="tcp:46556:97"/> do the like; and God was pleaſed for the Honour of his Son, in whoſe Name they caſt out Devils, to give them ſometimes Succeſs. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Action of the Diſciples towards this Perſon, we forbad him, <hi>becauſe he followed not with us;</hi> where is Obſervable their Raſhneſs in Forbidding him of their own Heads, before they had conſulted Chriſt about it, and their Envy and Emulation, in that they were grieved and diſcontented that good was done, becauſe they did not do it; it is as hard a matter to look upon the Gifts of others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Envy, as it is to look upon our own without Pride. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Our Saviour's Reply, <hi>forbid him not:</hi> Becauſe Our Saviour knew that this Action of caſting out Devils in his Name, would ſome ways Redound to his Glory, altho' he undertook the matter without Direction from Chriſt: We ought not to cenſure and condemn thoſe which do that which is good in it ſelf, tho' they fail in the manner of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p n="51">51 And it came to paſs when the time was come, that he ſhould be received up, he ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly ſet his Face to go to Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>The time now drew on, wherein our Saviour was to be Received up into Heaven; and accordingly he ſets his Face to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he might there Suffer, and from thence Aſcend. Now here we have <hi>Obſervable</hi> (1.) That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Neſt of his Enemies, the Stage upon which his Bloody Sufferings were to be Acted, the fatal place of his Death, yet nothing terrified with Danger, he ſets his Face for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, come what will, he will go with an invincible Courage and Reſolution. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That altho' Chriſt had a perfect and exact Knowledge of all the Bitter Sufferings he was to undergo for, and on behalf of his Members, yet did it not in the leaſt diſhearten him in, or diſcourage him from, that Great and Glorious Undertaking. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) That tho' Chriſt was firſt to Suffer, before he did Aſcend, and to be lifted up upon the Croſs, before recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up into Heaven, yet is there no mention of his Death here, but of his Aſcenſion only; as if all thoughts of Death were ſwallowed up in his Victory over Death; teaching us by his Example, to over-look our Suffering and Death, as not worthy to be named or mentioned with that Glory which we are received into, after Death. The Evangeliſt doth not ſay the time was come when he ſhould Suffer, but when he ſhould be Received up.</p>
               <p n="52">52 And ſent Meſſengers before his Face, and they went, and entered into a Village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 53 And they did not receive him, becauſe his Face was as tho he would go to Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour was now going from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and being to paſs thro' a Village of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he ſent Meſſengers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to prepare Entertainment for him. The Son of God, who was Heir of all things, ſends to, and ſues for a Lodging in a <hi>Samaritan</hi> Cottage. Oh Bleſſed Saviour, how can we be abaſed enough for thee, who thus neglected thy ſelf for us: It was thy pleaſure to appear, not in the Figure of a Prince, but in the Form of a Servant, yet the people in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Village would not receive him: Strange! to hear the Son of God Sue for a Lodging and be deny'd; but the Reaſon was, the difference of Religion which was between the Jews and the <hi>Samaritans:</hi> the Jews Worſhipped at the Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans</hi> at a Temple of their own, built upon Mount <hi>Gerizim.</hi> Upon the Building of this new Temple, there aroſe ſo great a Fewd between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and in proceſs of time, ſuch an implacable Hatred, that they would not ſhew common Civility to one another. A <hi>Samaritan</hi>'s Bread to a <hi>Jew</hi> was no better then Swines Fleſh; they would rather thirſt then drink a Draught of <hi>Samaritan</hi>-Water. Hence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That no Enmity is ſo deſperate as that which ariſes from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion.</p>
               <p n="54">54 And when his Diſciples James and John ſaw this, they ſaid, Lord, Wilt thou that we command Fire to come down from Heaven, and conſume them, as Elias did?</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (1.) The Crime which theſe Men were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of; no affront muſt be accounted little, no indignity light, that is offered to the Son of God. But theſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> did not Revile Chriſt, nor any of his Retinue, that we read of; they did not violently aſſault him, they did not follow him with Stones in their Hands, or Blaſphemies in their Mouths, but the wrong and injury was only Negative, <hi>They received him not:</hi> They denied him a Night's Lodging, and this not out of any diſlike of his Perſon, but from an antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Nation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Carriage of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon this occaſion; it was thus far commendable, that from the endeared Love which they bare to their Maſter, they did highly reſent the churliſh Denial of an act of Kindneſs towards him. A gracious Heart is Holily impatient at the ſight of any indignity offered to Chriſt: But their fault was, That they were too far Tranſported with Paſſion and Revenge, even to deſire the Death and Deſtruction of the uncivil <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans; Wilt thou that we command Fire to come down from Heaven and conſume them?</hi> They do not ſay, Maſter, will it pleaſe thee, who art Lord of the Creatures, to command Fire to come down? Nor did they ſay, if it be thy pleaſure, command us to call down Fire; but wilt thou that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Fire? this ſavours too much of Pride, Cruelty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſo dangerous is a miſguided Zeal.</p>
               <p n="55">55 But he turned and rebuked them, ſaying, ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of. 56 For the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them.</p>
               <p>Here we have our Saviour's Cenſure of the raſh and hot Motion of his Diſciples, which proceeded, (1.) from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of themſelves, <hi>Ye know not what Spirits ye are of;</hi> ye are not now under the rough and ſower Diſpenſation of the Law, but under the calm and gentle Inſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which deſigns univerſal Love, Peace, and good Will to all Mankind. Hence <hi>Learn</hi> firſt, That a cruel and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit is directly contrary to the Deſign and Temper of Chriſtianity. Secondly, That no difference in Religion, no pretence of Zeal for God can warrant and juſtify ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Temper. Again, This raſhneſs in the Diſciples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from their ignorance of Chriſt their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as well as of themſelves; <hi>The Son of man did not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them;</hi> that is, the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and deſign of my Coming, was to ſave and not deſtroy; tho' the accidental event of it may be otherwiſe, thro' the malice and perverſeneſs of men. <hi>Learn,</hi> That it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt, and his Holy Religion, to diſcountenance all fierceneſs, rage and cruelty in Men, one towards another; and to inſpire them univerſally with a Spirit of Love and Unity. Chriſt is ſo far from allowing us to perſecute them that hate us, that he forbids us to hate them that perſecute us.</p>
               <p n="57">57 And it came to paſs, that as they went in the way, a certain man ſaid to him, Lord, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt. 58 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Foxes have holes, and Birds of the air have neſts, but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) A Perſon reſolving to follow Chriſt, a good Reſolution if made deliberately and wiſely, not for ſiniſter Ends, or ſecular Advantages, which it is to be feared was the Caſe here, by our Saviour's Anſwer, <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air Neſts, but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, My Condition in the World is very poor, I have no houſe of Reſidence that I call my own; the Birds of the Air have their fixed Neſts, and the Beaſts of the Earth have their Dens and Holes, but I have no fixed Habitation; therefore if you think to follow me, for the ſake of Wordly Advantage, you will find your ſelf greatly diſappointed. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſuch Men will find themſelves miſerably miſtaken, and greatly diſappointed, who expect to gain any thing by following of Chriſt, but their Souls Salvation.</p>
               <p n="59">59 And he ſaid to another, follow me, but he ſaid, Lord, ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my father. 60 Jeſus ſaid unto him, Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:97"/>
               <p>We are not to ſuppoſe by this Prohibition, that Chriſt diſallows or diſapproves of any civil office from one Perſon to another, much leſs of a Child to a Parent, either Living or Dying; but he lets us know, (1.) That no Office of Love and Service to Man, muſt be preferred before our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, to whom we owe our firſt and chief Obedience. (2.) That lawful and decent Offices become ſinful, when they hinder greater Duties. (3.) That ſuch as are called by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel, muſt mind that alone, and leave inferiour Duties to inferiour Perſons; as if Chriſt had ſaid, others will ſerve well enough to bury the Dead, but thou that art called to Miniſter unto God, muſt do that unto which thou art called; under the Law, the Prieſts might not come near a dead Corpſe, nor meddle with the Interment of their own Parents, unto which our Saviour here proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly alludes.</p>
               <p n="61">61 And another alſo ſaid, Lord, I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee, but let me firſt go bid them farewel which are at home at my houſe. 62 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Here we have another Perſon that promiſed to follow Chriſt, but deſireth leave firſt to ſettle the affairs of his Family, and to take leave of his Friends; our Saviour tells him, if he would be one of his Miniſters, he muſt be like a Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who looks forward and not backward, otherwiſe he will never make his Furrows right; they will either be too deep, or too narrow, he muſt mind his Plough and nothing elſe. Thus muſt they that are called to the Work of the Miniſtry, mind it wholly, attend to that alone, their whole time, their whole ſtrength, muſt be devoted to it: The things of the World are things behind them, they muſt not look back upon them; nothing can juſtify a Miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf with rhe incumbrances of Worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but only perfect Neceſſity, for the Support of himſelf and his Family.</p>

               <p>The Captain General of our Salvation, Chriſt Jeſus, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving called, commiſſioned, and ſent forth his Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as great Commanders, to ſubdue his Native Kingdom of Iſrael to himſelf, at the ſixth Chapter of this Goſpel. In this Chapter he ſendeth after them a Band of Seventy Auxiliary Forces to Aid and Aſſiſt them; <hi>After theſe things the Lord appointed other Seventy Diſciples, and ſent them two by two before his Face.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The Perſon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioning and Sending them forth, Chriſt himſelf: Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That none ought to take upon them the Office of Preaching, or other Miniſterial Function in the Church, till thereunto called by Chriſt himſelf. The Twelve Apoſtles, and Seventy Diſciples, had an immediate Miſſion from Chriſt himſelf: All his Miniſters now are called mediately, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Authority from Chriſt, by the hands of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Church. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) The manner of their ſending two by two in a company, partly to make their Meſſage of more Authority, partly to teſtify their mutual conſent in the Doctrine they taught; and partly to comfort and encourage, to help and ſtrengthen, to aſſiſt and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other: In imitation of this Example, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits ſend forth their Emiſſaries by pairs, <hi>Jeſuitae ſemper ſunt Bini,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel do ſtand in great need of the mutual help and comfort of the united aſſiſtance and encouragement of each other, in the weighty Duties of their Calling and Function. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the next Verſe compares his Miniſters to Harveſt Labourers, who are to help and aſſiſt one another, the ſtrong endeavouring to ſtrengthen the hands of the weak. But Lord! What Tears are ſufficient to bewail the want of Love and Unity, yea the prevalency of that Envy and malignity which is found too often amongſt the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? ſo that inſtead of going forth two by two, happy is he that is alone in a place: Well might <hi>Melanchton</hi> bleſs God when he lay a dying, that he was going to a place where he ſhould be freed from the implacable hatred of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; this is, and ought to be for a Lamentation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Therefore ſaid he unto them, the Harveſt truly is great, but the Labourers are few, pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harveſt, that he would ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> here, (1.) That God's Church is an Harveſt Field; (2.) That the Miniſters of God are Labourers in his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, under God the Lord of the Harveſt. (3.) That to God alone doth it belong to ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt, and none muſt thruſt themſelves in, till God ſends them forth, <hi>Pray ye the Lord of the Harveſt that he ſend forth Labourers.</hi> (4.) That the number of Faithful Labourers, is comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmall and few: the Scribes and Phariſees in the Jewiſh Harveſt-field, are many; yet ſays Chriſt, <hi>The Labourers are few.</hi> (5.) That it is the Churches Duty to pray, and that earneſtly and inceſſantly to God the Lord of the Harveſt, to encreaſe the number of Faithful Labourers, and to ſend forth more Labourers into his Harveſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Go your ways, Behold, I ſend ye forth, as Lambs amongſt Wolves. 4 Carry neither Purſe, nor Scrip, nor Shoes, nor Salute any man by the way.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour (1.) Arms his Diſciples againſt the difficulties, dangers, and diſcouragements which they might meet with in the Courſe of their Miniſtry, by telling them, that he ſent them forth as Lambs among Wolves; thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that the Enemies of the Goſpel have as great an Inclination from their malicious Nature, to devour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Miniſters of Chriſt, as Wolves have from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper, to devour Lambs; <hi>Behold I ſend you forth as Lambs among Wolves.</hi> (2.) Our Saviour directs them in this their firſt Expedition to preach the Goſpel, to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the gracious care and good providence of God, both for Proviſion and Protection; <hi>carry neither purſe, nor ſcrip, nor ſtaff,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Truſt God with the care of your Lives, rely upon his Providence both for Protection and Proviſion; yet muſt we take notice, that this was only a temporary command, given to the Diſciples for this particular Journey, which they were quickly to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch; for in the General, Chriſt allows his Miniſters, as well as others, to exerciſe a prudent and provident care for themſelves and their Families. And as it is the Miniſters Duty to truſt God in the uſe of prudential Means for their Maintenance, ſo it is the Peoples Duty to take care for their Miniſters comfortable Subſiſtence. The <hi>Workman is worthy of his meat,</hi> ſays our Saviour; that is, of all neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; he is worthy of a comfortable Subſiſtence, and where it may be had, of an honourable maintenance.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And into whatſoever houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, peace be to this houſe. 6 And if the ſon of peace be there, your peace ſhall reſt upon it, if not, it ſhall turn to you again.</p>
               <p>Here our Bleſſed Saviour directs his Diſciples how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage themſelves in the executing of their Office, <hi>Into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever houſe ye enter,</hi> firſt ſay, <hi>peace be to this houſe,</hi> they muſt wiſh peace to the Sons of peace, yea to the Enemies of peace alſo; and as their peace ſhall reſt upon the one, ſo ſhall it return from the other; <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> is a fit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation for them to uſe, who were the Diſciples and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Prince of Peace; and very agreeable to the Goſpel they were to Preach, which was a Goſpel of Peace; and it was a Prayer as well as a Salutation; the Diſciples were to ſpeak it, not from the Lip only, but from the Heart alſo. Peace is the Muſick which both Angels and Men are delighted with, and the Chriſtian Religion is the greateſt Promoter and Preſerver of it; That commands us to <hi>pray for peace, to follow after peace, to part with our Coat and Cloak;</hi> that is, with our civil Rights, <hi>for peace, and if it be poſſible, to live peaceably with all men. Obſerve</hi> (2.) As the injunction given by our Saviour to his Diſciples, to deliver a meſſage of Peace; firſt ſay, <hi>Peace be to this houſe;</hi> ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb facs="tcp:46556:98"/> of what ſhould befal them in the Delivery of this their Meſſage: their Salutation, tho' it be Peace, yet will not find a welcome and entertainment with all Perſons, but only with the Sons of Peace, <hi>If the Sons of peace be there, your peace ſhall reſt upon it. Obſerve</hi> (3.) An Encouragement not to be afraid of delivering their Meſſage, tho' it wanted Succeſs; <hi>If your peace reſt not, it ſhall return to you again. Learn,</hi> (1.) That as there was at the firſt preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſo there is, and always will be, ſome that are Sons of Peace, and others that are Enemies unto Peace. (2.) That this Peace will reſt on none, but thoſe that are fit to receive it. (3.) That tho' it doth not reſt, yet it ſhall not be loſt, but return again to thoſe that publiſh it. Miniſters can but ſay, Peace be to this Houſe, they cannot make it reſt there; we can offer Terms of Peace to a loſt World, but cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel men to accept them, and if they finally refuſe them, <hi>We ſhall be a ſweet Savour unto God, as well in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, as in them that are ſaved.</hi>

               <p>Here our Saviour gives his Diſciples ſundry directions, how to manage themſelves in this Expedition for Preaching the Goſpel; he enjoyns them (1.) To obſerve the Rules of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, in going from place to place, having entered an houſe to continue there, not changing their Lodging and going from houſe to houſe, thereby avoiding all ſhew of Lightneſs and Inconſtancy, and teſtifying all gravity and ſtayedneſs in their Behaviour; this being a ſpecial means to win Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Perſons and Miniſtry. (2.) He gives them a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to work Miracles, for the confirming of the Doctrine which they Preach'd; <hi>Heal the Sick that are therein.</hi> This was neceſſary, partly to procure Reverence to their Perſons, being poor and unlearned Men, and partly to gain credit and Authority to their Doctrine; for the Doctrine of Faith in the Meſſias, as now come and exhibited in the Fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrange and new Doctrine to the Jews, the Truth and Certainty of it was to be extraordinarily ratified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by working Miracles; one ſort of which was healing of Diſeaſes in an extraordinary manner. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) How Chriſt encourages his Diſciples againſt the want of Succeſs; he bids them denounce the Judgments of God againſt ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of their Doctrine, <hi>by ſhaking off the duſt of their feet,</hi> which Action was Emblematical, and ſignified that God, in like manner would ſhake off them, and eſteem them no better then the vileſt Duſt. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That thoſe which deſpiſe the Meſſage that the Miniſters of the Goſpel bring, ſhall hereafter find, the Duſt of their Feet, and the Aſhes of their Graves to give a judicial Teſtimony againſt them, in the Day of Chriſt: Where ever the Word is Preach'd, it is for a Teſtimony, either a Teſtimony for, or againſt a People. For if the Duſt of a Miniſter's Feet, bear Witneſs againſt a People, their Sermons much more. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The dreadful Judgment denounced by our Saviour againſt the Contemners of his Diſciples Doctrine; Verily it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for that City.

<pb facs="tcp:46556:98"/> Satan,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>falling like Lightning from Heaven;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, Take heed of being puft up with Pride, upon the account of thoſe Endowments which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you; Remember <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the Prince of Pride, how he fell from Heaven by his Arrogancy, and Labour you to aſcend thither by Humility: The words in this ſenſe, afford this Inſtruction, That thoſe whom Chriſt has beſtowed the greateſt meaſure of Spiritual Graces, Miniſterial Gifts, and Temporal Bleſſings upon, ought, to be very watchful againſt that hateful Sin of Pride, which has ruin'd and deſtroy'd ſo many Thouſands of Angels and Men. (2.) Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Fall of Satan, not Literally, but Figuratively and Myſtically, of his Ruine by the Power and Preaching of the Goſpel; as if Chriſt had ſaid, I know that this is no vain boaſt of yours, no vaunt nor brag of your Valour, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are conquer'd by your Courage, for when I firſt ſent you forth to preach the Goſpel, and armed you with Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I eaſily foreſaw that the Devils Kingdom would ſhake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Ears, and that his Power would be ruin'd by the Power of the Goſpel, and that wherever you Preached, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Strength and Power ſhould vaniſh like a Flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuddenly, and irrevocably. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the powerful and efficacious Preaching of the Goſpel, is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means ordained and appointed by Chriſt for the Ruine and Subverſion of Satans Kingdom in the World; as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the power of God unto Salvation, to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey it, ſo it is the Power of God unto Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to Satan, and all that fight under his Banner againſt it.</p>

Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That tho' the Evil Angels by their Fall have loſt their happy Condition, yet not their original Conſtitution; their Honour, but not their Nature, they are Spirits ſtill. (2.)

That Evil Spirits are Subject to the Power of Chriſt, not only to his perſonal, but to his Miniſterial Power. (2.) That it is matter of great joy to ſee Evil Spirits brought into Subjection by the Power of Chriſt; to ſee the Evil Spirit of Pride and Contention, of Envy and Malice, of Error and Falſhood, of Jealouſy and Self-love, of Animoſity and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, not only chained but changed; to ſee not only an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing Subjection, but a Subjection of the Will given to Chriſt, is matter of great Joy, and unſpeakable Rejoycing: The Directive part of our Saviour's Words, lies in the latter part of the Verſe; <hi>But rather rejoyce that your Names are written in Heaven;</hi> There are no literal Records in the Court of Heaven, no Pen or Ink, Paper or Parchment; but <hi>to be written in Heaven,</hi> is to have a Title to Eternal Life, and to be made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.)

That Perſons may know that their Names are written in that Book, otherwiſe they could not rejoyce; for no Man can rejoyce in an unknown good. (4.) That it is greater matter of Joy and Rejoycing, to know that our Names are written in Heaven, then to have a Power to caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils here on Earth. A Man may have Power to caſt forth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils out of others, and yet at the ſame time, the Devil may have Power in and over himſelf; <hi>Therefore in this rejoyce not, that the Devils are ſubject unto you; But rather rejoyce, that your Names are written in Heaven:</hi> If you ſay, With what ſpectacles ſhall we read that at ſuch a Diſtance? Who will aſcend up into Heaven, to ſee whether his Name be written there? Or who can ſend a Meſſenger thither to ſearch the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords?

Our Saviour by this Parable taught him, that even Strangers and profeſſed Enemies, every one that needeth our help and relief, is to be accounted our Neighbour; to convince him hereof, Chriſt propounds this parable of a Jew that fell among Thieves, who was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Country-men, but relieved by a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who tho' a profeſſed Enemy upon the ſcore of Religion, yet was ſo exceeding kind and charitable, that he became Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, Surgeon, and Hoſt, and a real Neighbour to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Traveller, Wounded by Thieves, in his Journey to <hi>Jericho.</hi> From the whole <hi>Learn</hi> (1.)

<pb facs="tcp:46556:99"/> and thorough Charity; he turns his Face towards the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Man, his Feet haſten to him, his hand pours in Wine and Oyl into his Wounds, after which he ſets him upon his own Beaſt, brings him to the Inn, ſtays with him all Night, and the next day, becauſe his Recovery would be a Work of Time and Expence, he leaves him, but firſt leaves Money with the Hoſt, and a ſpecial charge to take care of him; with a punctual promiſe, that whatever was expended more ſhould be Repaid. Behold here an inſtance and pattern of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Charity, managed with as much Diſcretion as Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; well might our Lord ſay to this Perſon, and in him to every one of us, <hi>Go and do thou likewiſe.</hi>

               <p n="38">38 Now it came to paſs as they went, that he entered into a certain Village, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Woman named Martha received him into her houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) the great Work and Buſineſs of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Life, it was to go about Preaching the Goſpel. (2.) The Nature of the place which Chriſt at this time preached in, it was a poor <hi>Village, Bethany,</hi> as ſome think; Chriſt did not only take care of populous Cities, and great Towns, but private Villages and obſcure places, enjoyed alſo the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Miniſtry. Our Saviour's Example herein is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his Miniſters, not to affect great Auditories, and to Preach only in populous Cities, but to ſcatter the Seed of the Word in Country Villages, where are like precious Souls to be taken care of, and provided for; as Chriſt was ſent himſelf, ſo he ſends his Miniſters to preach the Goſpel to the poor. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The party that entertain'd him in the Village, <hi>Martha received him into her houſe; Martha</hi> is named becauſe ſhe was probably the Owner of the Houſe: Tho' Chriſt had no houſe of his own, yet he had as many as he pleaſed at his Command; for wherever he had an Heart, he was ſure to have an Houſe; <hi>Martha received him into her houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39 And ſhe had a Siſter called Mary, which alſo ſate at Jeſus feet, and heard his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Both theſe Siſters were Holy and Devout Women, both had an Honour and Reverence for Chriſt, and both are forward to entertain him; theſe were Siſters by Grace as well as by Nature; yea they both for a time attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Chriſt's Preaching. <hi>Mary</hi> (alſo) ſat at Jeſus Feet, implying, that <hi>Martha</hi> ſat there too, till Houſhold occaſions called her away: Oh how happy is that Family where all Parties are agreed to receive and entertain the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) No ſooner is Chriſt entered into <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>'s Houſe, but he falls a Preaching, whilſt they provide Bodily Food for him, he prepares ſpiritual Bread for them; oh that in our place and meaſure we might all imitate Chriſt in this: Can we come into any Houſe or Company, and find nothing to ſay or do for God. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Holy and Humble Deportment of <hi>Mary</hi> upon this occaſion, <hi>ſhe ſate at Jeſus Feet, and heard his words.</hi> When Chriſt was ſpeaking <hi>Mary</hi> was hearing, and little things could not take her off. Lord! how carefully ſhould we take the preſent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for our Souls, to hear and learn of thee as <hi>Mary</hi> did: She was not ſure of another opportunity, therefore hears humbly, attentively, affectionately, as if it were her laſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="40">40 But Martha was cumbered about much ſerving, and came to him, and ſaid, Lord, doſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve alone? Bid her therefore that ſhe help me.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) <hi>Martha</hi>'s Behaviour, <hi>She was cumbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout much ſerving,</hi> that is, much taken up with providing for the Entertainment of Chriſt and his Friends, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf was no miſcarriage, but a token of <hi>Martha</hi>'s endeared reſpect to her beſt Friend. A Perſon that ſincerely loves Chriſt, as <hi>Martha</hi> did, thinks it can never ſhew enough of reſpect unto him. <hi>Martha</hi> having ſuch a Gueſt to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her Houſe, puts forth her ſelf all ſhe can, yea, more then ſhe was able, to give him Entertainment, <hi>She was cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered about much ſerving.

               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> I well know thou doſt all this in Love to me, and it is no more then what is thy Duty in its proper Seaſon, but thou hadſt now an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to hear my Word, which thou canſt not have every da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thou haſt not made a bad Choice, but <hi>Mary</hi> has made a Better; ſhe has laid all aſide to attend upon my Miniſtry, and the fruit of it will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with her to all Eternity; <hi>It is that good part which ſhall never be taken away from her. Note</hi> here (1.) The unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Saviour's Anſwer to <hi>Martha,</hi> how contrary it was to her Expectation; ſhe thought that her Siſter ſhould have been ſent away with a check, and her ſelf with thanks, but ſhe is quite miſtaken; for all her good cheer that ſhe had provided for Chriſt, he ſpares not to tell her of her fault, <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> thou art troubled about many things. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That no Obligations to any particular Perſon ſhould ſo enthral us, but that our Tongues ſhould be at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to reprove the Faults of our beſt Friends wherever we find them. <hi>Martha,</hi> tho' a pious and good Woman, tho' a friendly and kind Woman, tho' a Woman greatly Beloved of Chriſt, yet is ſhe reproved by Chriſt. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) The Reproof given to <hi>Martha, Thou art troubled about many things;</hi> where Chriſt condemns not her Hoſpitality, but her ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and ſuperfluity, her diſtraction and perplexity; oh how prone are we to exceed in things Lawful and neceſſary, and to go beyond our Bounds in them; when we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the matter, we are prone to exceed in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Martha</hi>'s Entertainment of Chriſt was a noble Service, but ſhe was too anxious and ſollicitous about it; ſhe was <hi>cumbered,</hi> ſhe was <hi>careful,</hi> ſhe was <hi>troubled. Note</hi> (3.) Our Saviour's Admonition, <hi>But one thing is needful;</hi> that is, there is one thing which ought firſt and principally to be regarded by us, and is of the greateſt Concernment to us; namely, the Buſineſs of Religion, and the Care of our Souls Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the care of Religion, and our Souls Salvation, is the One Thing Neceſſary, and that which every Man is concerned in the firſt place, and above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:46556:100"/> things to regard and mind. <hi>Note</hi> (4.) Our Saviour's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of <hi>Marys</hi> choice, <hi>Mary hath choſen that good part, Non Tu malam ſed illa meliorem.</hi> Chriſt did not tell <hi>Martha,</hi> ſhe had choſen a Bad part, but her Siſter had choſen the Better. <hi>Martha</hi>'s Entertainment of Chriſt was good, but <hi>Marys</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon Chriſt's Miniſtry was better, and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto Chriſt. Chriſt was better pleaſed to ſee <hi>Mary</hi> in the Chapel, than <hi>Martha</hi> in the Kitchin, tho' he doth not condemn the one, yet he extols the other; <hi>Mary</hi> hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the good part. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Religion, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God muſt be the matter our Election and Choice; we muſt chooſe the good part, and it being once choſen by us, it ſhall never be taken away from us; <hi>One thing is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Mary hath choſen the good part, which ſhall never be taken away from her.</hi>

               <p>The Learned Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> upon this place, apprehends that it was the cuſtom of the Jewiſh Doctors, to deliver ſome certain Form of Prayer to their Diſciples to uſe, at leaſt that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt had done ſo to his Diſciples: Thereupon our Saviour's Diſciples beſought him, that he alſo would give them in like manner ſome Form of his own compoſing, that they might pray with their Maſters Spirit, as <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples did with his. Accordingly our Saviour gives them here a Form of his own, and commands them when they pray to uſe it. Indeed he had given them this Prayer about a year and half before, in his Sermon upon the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>After this manner pray ye;</hi> where it is probable, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples look'd upon it only as a pattern of Prayer, and not as a Form, for had they thought that Chriſt had given them a Form of Prayer before, they had not asked him for one now; Therefore ſays Chriſt, <hi>When ye pray, ſay:</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this gives us to underſtand, that our Saviour intended and commended it for a ſet Form of Prayer unto his Church. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Lords Prayer is both a Pattern and Platform, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which all our Prayers ought to be framed; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an exact Form of Prayer, which ought to be uſed by us in our Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace: <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pray ye,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew; When ye pray, ſay,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Luke.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here the favour which Chriſt does us in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a Form of Prayer to us; a great Favour, no doubt, tho' the World grows weary of it; we know not Alas! what to ask, but he himſelf teaches us, and frames our Supplication for us, that it may be accepted. Should a King's Son draw a Petition for a poor Subject, to be put up to his Father, what a ground of hope would there be, that whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired would be obtained; if any of us then think meanly of our Lord's Prayer; oh how meanly may he think of us, and of our Prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, As in Heaven, So in Earth. 3 Give us day by day our daily Bread. 4 And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins, For we alſo forgive every one that is indebted to us, And lead us not into Temptation, But deliver us from Evil.</p>
               <p>The Senſe and Signification of this Beſt of Prayers is this,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>O thou our Father in Jeſus Chriſt, who remaineſt in thy Throne in Heaven, and art there perpetually praiſed, and perfectly obey'd, by Glorious Angels and Glorified Saints, Grant that thy Name may be Glorified, thy Throne Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and thy Holy Will Obey'd here on Earth below, by us thy Sons and Servants, as readily, as cheerfully, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and in ſome degree of Proportion to what is done in Heaven above. And becauſe by reaſon of the Frailty of our Natures, we cannot ſubſiſt without the Comforts and Supports of Life, we crave our daily Bread at thy Bountiful hand; even ſuch a proportion of the good things of this Life, as thy Wiſdom ſhall ſee convenient for us.</p>
                  <p>And knowing that thy Holineſs and Juſtice doth oblige thee to puniſh Sin, and Sinners, we plead with thee for the ſake of thy Son's Satisfaction, to forgive us our daily Treſpaſſes; for it is our deſire and endeavour, heartily to forgive thoſe that have offended us; And ſeeing this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked World wherein we live is ſo full of Snares and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of all ſorts, we pray, that by the Power of thy Grace, and the Concurrence of our own careful endeavours, we may be kept from Satans Temptations, from the World's Allurements, and from our own Evil Inclinations; and be preſerved unblamable to thine Everlaſting Kingdom; and in Teſtimony of our Deſires and Aſſurance to be heard, we ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> ſo be it, ſo let it be, even ſo oh Lord, let it be for ever.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That God is the Father of all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as a Father, he knows all his children, he loves them, and takes care of them: As his Children it is our Duty to Honour him, to Obey him, to imitate him, to caſt our care upon him, and to long for the Enjoyment of him. (2.) From the Word <hi>Our, Learn,</hi> That it is our Duty to pray for others, as well as for our ſelves; we cannot pray acceptably for our ſelves, if we pray only for our ſelves. (3.) That the Hallowing, Honouring and Sanctifying of God's Name, as it is the firſt thing we are to pray for, ſo it ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other things whatſoever; we pray for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray for our own Salvation; we ſay <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> before we ſay, <hi>Forgive us our Debts.</hi> (4.) <hi>Learn,</hi> That Sins are Debts, and Sinners indebted to Divine Juſtice. Sin, it is an infinite Debt, a multiplied Debt, an inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Debt, and if not diſcharged by our Surety, we muſt ly in Priſon to all Eternity, for Non-payment of this Debt. (5.) That God has made our Forgiveneſs of others, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Forgiving us: The word <hi>As,</hi> is not a Note of Equality but of Similitude; we cannot equal God in Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but we muſt imitate him. (6.) No ſooner is Sin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but Satan will be buſy with his Temptation; forgive us our ſins, and lead us not into Temptation. (7.) That it is a greater Mercy to be Delivered from the Evil of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then from Temptations to Evil. The Evil of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is the Evil of Sin, but Temptations to Evil is at moſt but the Evil of Puniſhment, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil;</hi> Suffer us not to be led into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or if ſo, leave us not when we are Tempted.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And he ſaid unto them, which of you ſhall have a friend, and ſhall go unto him at mid-night, and ſay unto him, friend, lend me three loaves. 6 For a friend of mine in his Journey, is come unto me, and I have nothing to ſet before him. 7 And he from within ſhall anſwer and ſay, Trouble me not, the door is now ſhut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot riſe and give thee. 8 I ſay unto you, tho' he will not riſe and give him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is his friend, yet becauſe of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, he will riſe and give him as many as he needeth.</p>
               <p>The deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour in theſe, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, is to excite and ſtir up his Diſciples to fervency, importunity, and conſtancy in the Duty of Prayer, and to this purpoſe he makes uſe of a double Argument, the one of a Friend, and the other of a Father. (1.) He lays before them the Parable of a Friend, coming to his Friend at Mid-night, and by his importunity obtaining that of him which otherwiſe he muſt have gone without. From whence our Lord leaves us to infer, that if an impudent and bold Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar can obtain ſo much from Man, what cannot an humble, earneſt, and daily Petitioner obtain from God? What Friend ſo faithful and helpful to his deareſt Friend, as God is to us his Children. From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That a Man muſt be brought into a ſtate of Friendſhip and Reconciliation with God, if he hopes his Prayers ſhall be accepted. (2.) That when any of the Friends of God are in Neceſſities and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:100"/> Streights, he allows them the liberty at all hours to call upon him, and pray unto him, at mid-night as well as at Mid-day, God's ear is open to his Praying Friends. (3.) That Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God takes pleaſure in being urged in Prayer, by the Holy importunity of his Friends; never is he better pleaſed, then when his People, with Holy <hi>Jacob, Wreſtle with him, and will not let him go till he has bleſſed them.</hi> (4.) That ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humble importunity ſhall not only obtain what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, but more then we expected; only three Loaves were deſired here, but becauſe of importunity, he had as many as he needed; more is given in the Conceſſion, than was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in the Supplication.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And I ſay unto you, ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. 10 For every one that asketh, receiveth, and he that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, findeth, and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here goes on, to urge us to importunity and conſtancy in Prayer, he bids us <hi>ask, ſeek, and knock,</hi> and aſſures us we ſhall be accepted, heard, and anſwered. Here <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That Man is a poor indigent Creature, full of wants, but unable to ſupply them. (2.) As Man is an indigent and inſufficient Creature, ſo God is an All-ſufficient Good, able to ſupply the Wants, and to Relieve the Neceſſities of his Creatures. (3.) That All-mighty God ſtands ready to ſupply all our Wants, not Temporal only, but Spiritual alſo, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording his Grace, and the aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit to them that ask it. (4.) If therefore we want the Grace of God, and the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, it is our own fault and not God's; it is either for want of ſeeking, or for want of earneſtneſs in asking, for our Saviour expreſly aſſures us, that God denies it to none; <hi>but every one that asketh recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 If a Son ſhall ask Bread of any of you that is a Father, will he give him a ſtone? or if he ask a fiſh, will he for a fiſh give him a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? 12 Or if he ask an egg, will he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him a Scorpion? 13 If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p>
               <p>The Second Parable which our Saviour makes uſe of, is that of a Father to his Children. Chriſt repreſents the care and kindneſs of God towards us, by the affections which Earthly Parents bear to their natural Children, who tho' they be many times Evil themſelves, yet are not wont to deny their Children neceſſary good things when they dutifully and decently beg them at their hands; <hi>If ye being evil — how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give his holy Spirit;</hi> that is, the continual preſence and influence of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to all the purpoſes of Guidance and Direction, of Grace and Aſſiſtance, of Comfort and Support in our Chriſtian Courſe. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the preſence and aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit to enable us to do what God requires, ſhall never be wanting to thoſe that deſire it, and endeavour after it. But we muſt always remember, That the Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, tho' it be offered and tendered to us, yet it is not forced upon us; for if we beg the Holy Spirit, and his aſſiſtance, but refuſe to make uſe of it; or if we cry to him for his help to mortify our Luſts, but do not put forth his own endeavours, we forfeit the Divine Aſſiſtance, and God will certainly withdraw his Holy Spirit from us.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And Jeſus was caſting out a Devil, and it was dumb; and it came to paſs when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was gone out, that the dumb ſpake, and the people wondered. 15 But ſome of them ſaid he caſteth out Devils through Beelzebub the chief of the Devils. 16 And other tempting him, ſought of him a ſight from Heaven. 17 But he knowing their thoughts, ſaid unto them, Every kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to deſolation, and a houſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt a houſe, falleth. 18 If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan alſo be divided againſt himſelf, how ſhall his kingdom ſtand? becauſe ye ſay that I caſt out Devils thrô Belzebub. 19 And if I by Beelzebub caſt out Devils, by whom do your Sons caſt them out? therefore ſhall they be your judges. 20 But if I with the Finger of God caſt out Devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.</p>
               <p>A Relation is here given of a famous Miracle wrought by our Saviour in caſting a Devil out of a poſſeſſed Man; it is called a dumb Devil, becauſe of the effect upon the poor poſſeſſed Perſon in reſtraining the uſe of his Tongue. <hi>Learn</hi> here, (1.) That amongſt the many Calamities which Sin has rendered humane Nature liable and obnoxious to, this is one, to be bodily poſſeſt by Satan. (2.) That one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Chriſt's Divine Power, and a convictive Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his being truly and really God, was his caſting out Devils by the Word of his Power. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) What a ſad and contrary effect this Miracle had upon the wicked Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees through their own blindneſs, obſtinacy, and malice; inſtead of magnifying his Divine Power, they maliciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him for holding a correſpondency with the Devil, and acting by a Power derived from him; as if Satan ſhould lend our Saviour a power againſt himſelf, and that for the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his own Kingdom. Lord! how dangerous is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oppoſition againſt the Truth, it provokes the Almighty to deliver Perſons up to the moſt unreaſonable Infidelity, and obſtinate Obduracy. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) Our Saviour knowing their Thoughts, makes a juſt Apology for himſelf, by ſhewing how improbable and unlikely, how unreaſonable and abſurd it is once to imagine or ſuppoſe, that Satan ſhould caſt out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and any ways ſeek to oppoſe or deſtroy his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Now if I have received (ſays Chriſt) my power from Satan, for caſting out of Satan, then is the Devil like a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily divided within it ſelf, and divided like a Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, which can never ſtand buſt muſt be brought to Deſtruction. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, Our Saviour tells the Phariſee, that they might with as much reaſon attribute all other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Power of the Devil, as thoſe wrought by himſelf; for there were certain Jews amongſt them that caſts out Devils in the Name of the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> now our Saviour asks them by what power theſe their Children caſt them out? They acknowledged that what they did was by the Power of God, and there was no cauſe, but their malice, why they ſhould not acknowledge, that what he did was by the ſame Power? <hi>If I by Beelzebub caſt out Devils, by whom do your ſons caſt them out? but if I with the finger of God caſt them out, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you;</hi> that is, the long expected Kingdom of the Meſſias is certainly come, and I having wrought theſe Miracles by my own Power, is a Demonſtrative proof that I am the promiſed Meſſias.</p>
               <p n="21">21 When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. 22 But when a ſtronger then he ſhall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein he truſted, and divideth his ſpoil. 23 He that is not with me, is againſt me, and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth. 24 When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, ſeeking reſt and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none; he ſaith, I will return to my houſe whence I came out. 25 And when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſht. 26 Then goeth he and taketh to him ſeven other Spirits, more wicked then himſelf, and they enter in and dwell there; and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having ſufficiently ſhewn, that he did not Work his Miracles by the Power of the Devil, he next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb facs="tcp:46556:101"/> the Phariſees from whence he had that Power, even from God himſelf; accordingly he compares Satan to a ſtrong Man armed with Weapons to defend his Houſe, and himſelf cloathed with Divine Power, he compares him to one that is ſtronger th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Note</hi> here, (1.) That Satan is an unclean Spirit, he hath loſt his Original Purity, his Holy Nature in which he was Created, and is by ſin become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſinful and impure, no means being allowed him by God, for the purging of his filthy and impure Nature; yea, he is a perfect Enemy to Purity and Holineſs; maligning all that Love it, and would promote it. (2.) That Satan is a reſtleſs and unquiet Spirit, being caſt out of Heaven, he can reſt no where; when he is either gone out of a Man by Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or caſt out by Power, he has no content or ſatisfaction, till he returns into a filthy Heart, where he delights to be, as the Swine in miry places. (3.) That wicked and prophane ſinners have this unclean Spirit dwelling in them; their Hearts are Satans Houſe and Habitation, and the Luſts of Pride and Unbelief, Malice and Revenge, Envy and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, theſe are the Garniſhings and Furniture of Satans Houſe: Mans Heart was God's Houſe by Creation, 'tis now Satan's by Uſurpation and judiciary Tradition. (4.) That Satan by the Preaching of the Goſpel, may ſeem to go out of Perſons, and they become ſober and civilized, yet may he return again to his old habitation, and the latter end of that Man may be worſe then the beginning.</p>
               <p n="27">27 And it came to paſs as he ſpake theſe things, a certain woman of the company lift up her voice, and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſuckt. 28 But he ſaid, Yea rather Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they, that hear the word of God and keep it.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) How ready we are to admire Perſons for their external Priviledges, and the favours of Divine Providence, and to pronounce ſuch Bleſſed; <hi>Bleſſed is the Womb that bare thee.</hi> (2.) That Chriſt makes another judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Perſons, and pronounces them more bleſſed that bear him in their hearts by Faith, then his own Mother who bare him in her Womb by ſenſe. The Bleſſedneſs of being an Obedient Believer, is far greater than that of being the Mother of our Bleſſed Saviour. Bleſſed be God this great and gracious Priviledge is not deny'd unto us now. Altho' we cannot ſee Chriſt, yet love him we may; his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cannot be enjoyed by us, but his Spiritual, Gracious Preſence is not denyed us: Tho' Chriſt be not ours in houſe, in arms, by Affinity, by Conſanguinity, yet in Heart, in Faith, in Love, in Service, he is or may be ours; verily ſpiritual Regeneration, and an obediential doing of God's Will, bringeth men into a more Honourable Relation to Chriſt, than natural Generation ever did; <hi>Yea, rather bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</hi>

               <p>The Sign which the Phariſees here deſired of our Saviour, was a Miracle wrought by him: Now our Saviour, tho' he was very ready to work Miracles, to encourage and confirm his Hearers Faith, yet not to ſatisfy the unbelieving Phariſees Curioſity: And accordingly he tells them, they ſhould have no other Sign than that of his Reſurrection, which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was a Type of. Next he threatens them for their Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Infidelity, which he aggravates from the Example of the Queen of the South, and the Men of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> From hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the ſins of infidelity and impenitency are exceedingly heightned, and their guilt aggravated, from the Means afforded by God to bring Men to Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The ſin of the Phariſees was infinitely greater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Evidence of Chriſt's Miracles, than the ſin of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> would have been in refuſing to hearken to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> his Miniſtry; therefore the <hi>Ninevites</hi> ſhall condemn the Phariſees.</p>
               <p n="33">33 No man when he hath lighted a Candle, putteth it in a ſecret place, neither under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick, that they which come in may ſee the Light. 34 The light of the body is the eye; therefore when thine eye is ſingle, thy whole body alſo is full of Light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body alſo is full of darkneſs. 35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee, be not darkneſs. 36 If thy whole body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall be full of light, having no part dark, the whole ſhall be full of light, as when the bright ſhining of a candle doth give thee light.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour in theſe words does theſe two things, (1.) he declares, that altho' his Miniſtry had no effect upon the proud and obſtinate Phariſees, yet he would not hide the light which he came into the World to bring, nor conceal that Heavenly Doctrine which his Father had committed to him to Communicate to the Children of Men; teaching us, That ſuch as are enlightned by God with the Knowledge of his Word and Will, ought not to conceal and hide this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge within themſelves, but communicate it to others, and improve it for the good and benefit of others; <hi>No man that lighteth a Candle, putteth it under a Buſhel.</hi> (2.) Our Saviour here diſcovers the Reaſon why the Phariſees continued blind under ſo clear a light as that of his Miniſtry; namely becauſe the eye of their Underſtanding was darkned, not ſo much with Ignorance as with Prejudice, whereby they oppoſed Chriſt and his Holy Doctrine, for if the Mind be clearly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Word and Spirit of God, that Light will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and ſpread it ſelf in the Soul, as the bright ſhining of a Candle doth in the Houſe, enlightning all the inward Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and directing all the outward Actions, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its Light alſo to the enlightning of others.</p>

               <p>Obſerve here (1.) The free Converſation of our Bleſſed Saviour, how readily he complies with the Phariſees Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to dine with him; I do not find that when Chriſt was invited to any Table, that ever he refuſed to go, if a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, if a Publican invited him, he conſtantly went, not ſo much for the pleaſure of eating, as for the opportunity of Converſing and doing good; Chriſt feaſts us when we feed him: He ſays of himſelf, that he came eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, allowing himſelf a free tho' innocent Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all ſorts of Perſons, that he might gain ſome. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Exception which the Phariſee takes at our Saviour's not waſhing his hands before Dinner. This they made (but without any warrant for it) a Religious Act; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in external waſhings, but neglecting the inward Purgations of their Hearts and Conſciences from Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs: Thus Phariſaical Hypocriſy puts God off with outward cleanſing, inſtead of inward Purity; regarding more the outward cleanneſs of the hand, than the inward Purity of the Heart. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Our Bleſſed Saviour does not condemn any external Decency and cleanlineſs in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; but his deſign is to ſhew the vanity of outward Purity, without inward Sanctity, and to convince them of the Neceſſity of cleanſing the Heart, in order to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and Reforming the Life. The Phariſee waſht his hands clean, but left his Soul full of uncleanneſs, not conſidering, that he that made the Soul as well as the Body, requires that both ſhould be kept pure, all the impiety of mens Lives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the impurity of their Hearts and Natures.</p>

               <p>Our Saviour here denounces a Wo againſt the Phariſees, for their ſtrict and ſcrupulous obſerving the leſſer things of the Law, as Tything Mint, and Rue, whilſt they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the principal and ſubſtantial Duties which they owed both to GOD and Man. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That altho' ſome Duties are of greater moment and importance than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet a good Man will omit none, but make Conſcience of all, both great and ſmall, in obedience to the Command of God: there is no Duty ſo little as to be neglected, no Command ſo ſmall as to be diſobeyed; but yet there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Duties, and our firſt regard ought to be to the greater, then to the leſs.

               <p>The next Wo denounced againſt the Phariſees, is for their Ambition, Pride, and Popularity, affecting the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Seats in the Synagogues, and Salutations in the Markets, where their fault was, not in taking, but in affecting theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt places: God is the God of Order, there may and ought to be a precedency amongſt Perſons, honour is to be given to whom honour is due, and that by God's Command.

               <p>Another Wo is here denounced againſt the Phariſees, for cheating and deceiving the people with an outward ſhew and appearance of Piety and Religion. They were like Graves and Sepulchres grown over with Graſs, which tho' they held dead mens Bones, yet the putrefaction not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appearing, Men walked unawares over them, and ſo were polluted by them; intimating, that the inward Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and filthy Corruptions of the Phariſees not appearing unto Men, the people were eaſily deceived by outward ſhews of Phariſaical Sanctity, and ſo fell into a dangerous imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the great deſign of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, is to cheat the World with an empty ſhew of Piety; the Hypocrites Ambition is to be thought good, not to be ſo. <hi>Learn</hi> (2.) That nothing is more fatally dangerous to the Souls of Men, and draws Perſons to an admiration and imitation of hypocritical Profeſſors, like their outward ſhews of Sanctity, and their extraordinary appearances of Devotion and Piety. This it was that gained the Phariſees ſuch a veneration and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem among the people, that it became a proverb amongſt them, <hi>If but two men went to Heaven, the one muſt be a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee;</hi> but their counterfeit piety being double iniquity, they did receive for it double Damnation.</p>

               <p>The former Woes were denounced by our Saviour againſt the Phariſees, who had their Name from an Hebrew word which ſignifies <hi>to ſeparate,</hi> becauſe they were perſons ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet apart for ſtudying the Law of God, and teaching it to others. The next Wo is here denounced againſt the Lawyers, that is, the Scribes of the Law, of which there were two ſorts, the Civil Scribe, and the Eccleſiaſtical Scribe; the Civil Scribe was a publick Notary, or Regiſter of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, employed in writing Bills of Divorce, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in the Phylacteries. The Eccleſiaſtical Scribe was an expounder of the Scripture, an interpreter of the Law, Men of great Learning and Knowledge, whoſe Decrees and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations the Phariſees ſtrictly obſerved; this Lawyer here, inſolently calls our Saviour's Reproof a Reproach; however, our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who never feared the Face, or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the perſon of any Man, gives them their portion, and lets them know wherein they were faulty, as well as the Phariſees, and accordingly pronounces a Wo unto them alſo, for a threefold Crime; (1.) For their laying heavy Burthens upon others Shoulders, which they would not touch with one of their own Fingers. Theſe Burthens in general were a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid exaction of Obedience to the whole Ceremonial Law, and in particular the Burthen of Traditions, certain auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and ſeverities which they impoſed upon the people, but would not undergo any part of them themſelves, in vain do we hope to oblige our Hearers to follow thoſe Rules of Life, which we refuſe or neglect to put in practiſe our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="47">47 Wo unto you, for ye build the Sepulchres of the Prophets, and your fathers killed them. 48 Truly ye bear witneſs that ye allow the Deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and ye build their Sepulchres. 49 Therefore alſo ſaid the wiſdom of God, I will ſend them Prophets and Apoſtles, and ſome of them they ſhall ſlay and Perſecute. 50 That the blood of all the Prophets which was ſhed from the foundation of the World, may be required of this Generation. 51 From the blood of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel to the blood of Zacharias, which periſhed between the Altar and the Temple; Verily I
<pb facs="tcp:46556:102"/> ſay unto you, it ſhall be required of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Crime which Chriſt reproves in theſe Men, is their grand Hypocriſy, in pretending great honour to the Saints departed, building their Tombs, and garniſhing their Sepulchres, declaiming againſt their Fathers impiety, that had they lived in their days, they would not have been partakers with them in their ſins. Now their Hypocriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> appeared in three Particulars; (1.) In that they continued in their own wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kedneſs, and yet commended the Saints departed; they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Saints, but multiply their ſins, and inſtead of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Vertues, they content themſelves with garniſhing their Sepulchres. (2.) In profeſſing great Reſpect to the Dead Saints, and at the ſame time Perſecuting the Living: Palpable Hypocriſy! and yet as groſs as it is, it prevails to this day: The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who magnifies Martyrs, Canonizes Saints departed, have yet added to their number, by ſhedding of their Blood. (3.) In taking falſe meaſures of their Love to the Saints departed, from their Building their Tombs, and garniſhing their Sepulchres; whereas the beſt Evidence of our Love to them, is the imitating their Vertues, and cheriſhing their Followers. 'Tis groſs Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy to pay reſpect to the Relicks of Saints, and Veneration to their Images, and at the ſame time to perſecute and hate their Followers. From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That the World has all along Loved dead Saints better than living ones, <hi>Mortui non mordent;</hi> the dead Saints Example, how bright ſoever, is not ſo ſcorching and troubleſome at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and he himſelf ſtands no longer in other Mens Light; whereas the Living Saints Example is a cutting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to Sin and Vice. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) That there is a certain Civility in humane Nature, which leads Men to a juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Dead, and to a due eſtimation of their Worth. The Phariſees here, tho' they perſecuted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets whilſt alive, yet did they pretend to a mighty Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Piety and Vertue, after they were dead, and thought no Honour too great to be done unto them. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) That it is the greateſt Hypocriſy imaginable to pretend to love Goodneſs, and at the ſame time to hate and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute good Men. Theſe Phariſees and Lawyers pretended high to Piety and Religion, and at the ſame time killed the Prophets. <hi>Note</hi> (4.) That the higheſt Honour we can pay to the Saints departed, is not by raiſing Monuments, and Building Tombs to their Memory, but by a careful imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Piety and Vertue, following the Holineſs of their Lives, and their Patience and Conſtancy at their Death. Laſtly <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is a Righteous thing with God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Children for the impiety of their Parents, when they walk in their ungodly Parents Footſteps; upon you ſhall come the Blood of all the Prophets, from the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> to the Blood of <hi>Zacharias;</hi> yet this muſt be underſtood of Temporal Evils, not of Eternal Puniſhments; no Man for his Fathers Sins ſhall lye down in Everlaſting Burnings; as our Fathers Faith will not let us into Heaven, ſo neither will their Impiety ſhut us into Hell: At the Day of Judgment every Man ſhall be ſeparately conſidered according to his own Deeds.</p>
               <p n="52">52 Wo unto you Lawyers, for ye have taken away the Key of Knowledge, ye entered not in your ſelves, and them that were entering in, ye hindered.</p>
               <p>The laſt Wo pronounced by our Saviour againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, is for perverting the Holy Scriptures, and keeping the true ſenſe and knowledge of them from the People; This St. <hi>Luke</hi> here calls, <hi>The taking away the Key of Knowledge from Men;</hi> alluding to a cuſtom among the Jews in Admiſſion of their Doctors: Thoſe that had Authority given them to interpret the Law and the Prophets, were ſolemnly admitted into that Office, by delivering to them a Key and a Table-Book, ſo that by the Key of Knowledge is meant the Interpretation and Underſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and by taking away that Key, is ſignified (1.) That they arrogated to themſelves the ſole Power of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Interpreting the Holy Scriptures. (2.) That they kept the true knowledge of the Scriptures from the People, eſpecially the Prophecies which concerned the Kingdom and Coming of the Meſſias; and ſo they hindered Men from embracing our Saviour's Doctrine, who were otherwiſe well enough diſpoſed for it. <hi>Learn,</hi> Firſt, That the written Word is the Key whereby an entrance into Heaven is opened unto Men. (2.) That the uſe of this Key, or the Knowledge of the Word of God, is abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in order to Salvation. (3.) That great is the Guilt, and inexcuſable the Fault, of thoſe who deny the People the uſe of this Key, and deprive them of the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, which alone can make them wiſe unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. (4.) That ſuch as do ſo, ſhut the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt Men, endeavouring what in them lies, to hinder their Salvation; Men may miſcarry with their Knowledge, but they are ſure to periſh for lack of Knowledge.</p>

How our Bleſſed Saviour's Plain and Faithful dealing with theſe Men does Enrage, inſtead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; they are filled with Anger and Indignation. (2.) Their Wrath ſets their Wits on Work to enſnare him. Lord! When any of thy Faithful Miniſters and Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors meet with the like Uſage and Treatment from a wicked World; when any lye in wait to catch ſomething out of our Mouth, that therewith they may enſnare us, give us thy Prudence and thy Patience, that we may cut off occaſion from thoſe that ſeek occaſion againſt us, and diſappoint them of their purpoſe; or elſe furniſh us with ſuch meaſures of Meekneſs and Patience, as becomes Perſons of our Holy Character and Profeſſion; that we may Glory in Reproaches, in Perſecutions and Diſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake; and that the Spirit of Glory and of God may reſt upon us.</p>

               <p n="1">1 IN the mean time, when there were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together an innumerable multitude of people, inſomuch that they trode one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he began to ſay unto his Diſciples, firſt of all, Beware ye of the Leaven of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees which is Hypocriſy. 2 For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing covered that ſhall not be revealed, neither hid that ſhall not be known. 3 Therefore whatſoever ye have ſpoken in darkneſs ſhall be heard in the light, and that which ye have ſpoken in the ear in cloſets, ſhall be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the houſe tops.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter our Bleſſed Saviour furniſhes his Diſciples with many Inſtructions for the worthy diſcharge of their Function in Preaching the Goſpel; particularly he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unto them two gracious Qualifications, namely, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and ſincerity, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Secondly Courage and Magnanimity, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. (1.) He recommends unto them the Grace and Vertue of Sincerity, <hi>Beware of the Leaven of the Phariſees, which is hypocriſy. Learn</hi> thence, That hypocriſy is a dangerous Leaven, which Miniſters and People are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eſpecially to beware of, and to preſerve themſelves from. Hypocriſy is a Vice in a Vizor, the Face is Vice, the Vizor is Vertue, God is pretended, ſelf intended; Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy is reſembled to Leaven; partly for its ſowerneſs, partly for its diffuſiveneſs. Leaven is a piece of ſower dow, that diffuſes it ſelf into the whole Maſs or Lump of Bread with which it is mixed. Thus Hypocriſy ſpreads over all the Man, all his Duties, Parts, and Performances are Leavened with it. Again, Leaven is of a ſwelling, as well as of a ſpreading Nature; it puffs up the Dough, and ſo doth Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, the Heart. The Phariſees were a ſour and proud ſort of People, they were all for preheminence, chief pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, chief Seats, chief Titles, to be called, <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi;</hi> in a word, as Leaven is hardly diſcerned from good Dough, at firſt ſight, ſo is Hypocriſy hardly diſcerned and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Sincerity. The Phariſees outwardly appeared righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous unto Men, but within were full of Hypocriſy and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:102"/> 
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the Argument which Chriſt uſes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men from Hypocriſy, <hi>There is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed;</hi> as if he had ſaid, the day is coming, when a rotten and corrupt Heart ſhall no longer paſs under the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor and diſguiſe of a demure Look. In the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Hypocritical ſinners ſhall walk naked, GOD, Angels, and Men, ſhall ſee their Shame. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That God will certainly, e're long, waſh off all the Varniſh and Paint which the Hypocrite has put upon the Face of his Profeſſion, and lay him open to the Terrour of himſelf, and the Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And I ſay unto you my friends, Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them, that kill the Body, and after that have no power, that they can do. 5 But I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear, fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</p>
               <p>The Second Duty which our Saviour preſſes upon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is that of Holy Courage and Reſolution: As if Chriſt had ſaid, The Preaching of the Goſpel will ſtir up many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies againſt you, which will malign and oppoſe you, vex and perſecute you; but I ſay unto you, fear them not, who can only kill the Body, but fear him, who if you fail in your Duty, can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell. Here <hi>Note</hi> (1.) an unwarrantable fear condemned, and that is the ſinful, ſervile, ſlaviſh fear of Man; <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body.</hi> (2.) An holy, awful, and prudential fear of the Omnipotent God commended; <hi>Fear him that is able to kill both Body and Soul.</hi> (3.) The Perſons whom this Duty of fear is recommended to, and bound upon; Diſciples, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Ambaſſadors, all the Friends of Chriſt. They not only may, but ought to fear him; not only for his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs, but upon the account of his punitive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as being able to caſt both Soul and Body into Hell. Such a fear is not only Lawful, but Lawdable, not only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but Commanded, and not misbecoming the Friends of Chriſt. The Miniſters of God may uſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from fear of Judgments, both to diſſwade from Sin, and to perſwade to Duty. It is not unſuitable to the beſt of Saints, to keep in Heavens way for fear of Hell, 'tis good to bid a Friend fear, when that fear tendeth to his good.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Are not five Sparrows ſold for two far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and not one of them is forgotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. 7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered, fear not therefore, ye are of more value than many Sparrows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, (1.) The Doctrine which our Saviour Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to his Diſciples, and that is the Doctrine of the Divine Providence, which concerns it ſelf for the meaneſt Creatures. Even the Birds of the Air, and the Hairs of our Heads, do fall within the Compaſs of God's protecting Care. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) Tha uſe which our Saviour makes of this Doctrine, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to fortify his Diſciples Spirits againſt all Diſtruſtful fears, and diſtracting cares. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Divine Care, and Gracious Providence of God over us and ours, ought to Antidote our Spirits againſt all diſtruſtful fears whatſoever. If an hair from the Head falls not to the ground without a Providence, much leſs ſhall the Head it ſelf: If the very excrements of the Body (ſuch are the Hair) be taken care of by God, ſurely the more Noble parts of the Body, but eſpecially the Nobleſt part of our Selves, our Souls, ſhall fall under his particular Regard.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Alſo I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs me before men, him ſhall the Son of man confeſs before the Angels of God. 9 But he that denieth me before men, ſhall be denied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angels of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> here, (1.) That not to confeſs Chriſt, is in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to deny him, and to be aſhamed of him. (2.) That whoſoever ſhall deny o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now theſe Miracles, tho' evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wrought by the power of God, the Phariſees aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Power of the Devil, which our Saviour calls Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and a Sin unpardonable.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And when they bring you into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and unto Magiſtrates and Powers, take ye no thought how, or what ye ſhall anſwer, or what ye ſhall ſay. 12 For the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you in the ſame hour what ye ought to ſay.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour acquaints his Apoſtles, that for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Doctrine, and profeſſing his Religion, they ſhould be brought before all ſorts of Magiſtrates, and into all kinds of Courts; but adviſes them when they ſhould be ſo brought, not to be anxiouſly thoughtful, or ſollicitouſly careful what they ſhould ſay; for it ſhould be ſuggeſted to them by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt what they ſhould ſpeak in that Hour. Thence <hi>Note,</hi> That tho' the Truth of Chriſt may be oppoſed, yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of it ſhall never be aſhamed, for rather then they ſhall want a Tongue to plead for it, God himſelf will prompt them by his Holy Spirit, and furniſh them with ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to defend the Truth, as all their Adverſaries ſhall not be able to gainſay; <hi>In that hour the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you what ye ought to ſay.</hi>

               <p n="13">13 And one of the Company ſaid unto him, Maſter, Speak to my brother that he divide the Inheritance with me. 14 And he ſaid unto him, Man, Who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</p>
               <p>Whilſt our Saviour was thus inſtructing his Diſciples and the reſt of his Auditors, in things appertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; one of the Company being more intent, as it ſeems, upon his Temporal, then his Eternal Concerns, deſired him to ſpeak to his Brother to divide the Inheritance with him. Chriſt tells him, he would neither be judge nor arbitrator in any civil Affairs, or ſecular Concerns. This Work, as if Chriſt had ſaid, belongs to the civil Magiſtrate, to divide Inheritances, and decide Controverſies betwixt Man and Man. But my work is of another Nature namely, to preach the Goſpel to a loſt World, and to direct Men how to ſecure an Inheritance in Heaven, not to divide Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here on Earth. Teaching us, That matters of Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice do not belong to thoſe whom Chriſt ſends forth to preach the Goſpel, that work alone is ſufficient for them: The proper Work of a Miniſter is work enough, one branch of which is to manage a perſwading task betwixt Neighbour and Neighbour, to prevent Differences and to compoſe them; but as Chriſt's Commiſſioners, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, they have no Authority to intermeddle in civil Judgments;

               <p>Our Saviour upon the occaſion given him in the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes, admoniſhes all his Diſciples and Followers to take heed and beware of the Sin of Covetouſneſs; aſſuring them, that neither the Comfort nor Continuance of Man's Life doth conſiſt in an Abundance; for tho' ſomething of this World's Goods is neceſſary to the Comfort and Happineſs of Life, yet abundance is not neceſſary. Here <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (1.) The manner of our Lord's Caution; he doubles it, not ſaying take heed alone, or beware only, but <hi>take heed and beware</hi> both; this argues that there is a ſtrong inclination in our Natures to this Sin; the great danger we are in of falling into it, and of what fatal Conſequence it is to them in whom this Sin Reigns. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The matter of the Caution, or the Sin which our Saviour warns his Hearers againſt, and that is Covetouſneſs; <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs;</hi> where under the Name and Notion of Covetouſneſs, our Saviour doth not condemn a provident Care for the things of this Life, nor a regular Induſtry and Diligence for obtaining of them, nor every degree of Love and Affection to them; but by Covetouſneſs is to be underſtood, an eager and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable deſire after the things of this Life, or uſing unjuſt ways and means to get or encreaſe an Eſtate; ſeeking the things of this Life, with the neglect of things infinitely better, and placing their chief Happineſs in Riches. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Reaſon of this Caution, <hi>Becauſe mans Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> Humane Life is ſuſtained by a little, therefore abundance is not neceſſary either to the Support or Comfort of it: 'Tis not a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and vaſt Poſſeſſions that makes a Man happy in this World, but a mind ſuited to our Condition, whatever it be.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And Jeſus ſpake a Parable unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. 17 And he thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, ſaying, What ſhall I do, becauſe I have no room where to beſtow my fruits? 18 And he ſaid, this will I do, I will pull down my Barns, and build greater, and there will I beſtow all my fruits and my goods. 19 And I will ſay to my Soul, Soul, thou haſt goods, much goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry. 20 But God ſaid unto him, Thou fool, This Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee. Then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, which thou haſt provided? 21 So is he that layeth up Treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich towards God.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of our Saviour in this Parable, is to ſhew Men the vileneſs and vanity of the Sin of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or an eager and inſatiable deſire after the things of this World. When Men heap up Riches, and lay up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in this Life, taking no care to be Rich towards God in Faith and good Works, our Saviour illuſtrates this by the Parable of a Rich Man, whom God had Bleſſed with great Plenty, yet his deſire of more wealth was never ſatisfied, but he is projecting how he may lay up Goods in ſtore for many Years. Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That the Parable doth not inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any indirect and unjuſt ways of Gain, which this Man uſed to encreaſe his Eſtate, but condemns his inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Thirſt after more. So that hence we may <hi>Learn,</hi> That an eager and inordinate deſire after the things of this World, tho' it be free from injuſtice, and doing wrong to others, is one ſpecies or kind of the ſin of Covetouſneſs. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) How this rich Man looked no farther than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not looking upon himſelf as God's Steward, but his own Carver, he cries out, <hi>What ſhall I do, becauſe I have no room where to lay my fruits?</hi> not conſidering that the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Poor ſhould have been his Granaries; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of his Encreaſe; Charity to the Neceſſitous is the beſt way of beſtowing our Abundance. God's extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bounty is to be laid out for the Relief of others Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, not for the gratifying of our own Luxurious Deſires. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Brand of Infamy which the wiſe God fixes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Covetous Rich Man, <hi>Thou fool,</hi> ſays God; <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That it is an act and inſtance of the moſt egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Folly imaginable, for Perſons to ſpend their time and ſtrength in getting and laying up Treaſure upon Earth; in the mean time neglecting to be rich towards God in Faith and good Works, <hi>Thou fool. Obſerve</hi> (4.) The doleful Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and threatning News brought unto him, <hi>This Night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee. Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That all a Mans Wealth is not able to preſerve his Life, much leſs to ſave his Soul; and if Wealth cannot ſave a Mans Life, why ſhould men endanger their Lives, nay hazard their Souls to get or encreaſe Wealth. <hi>Learn,</hi> (2.) That God takes away Mens Lives many times when they leaſt ſuſpect it, <hi>This night,</hi> ſays God; many Years, ſays he; God will not have us think of Reſt in a place of Diſquiet, nor of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in a Condition of Inconſtancy; we are Dependant Creatures, and our time is in God's Hand; <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoul be taken away from thee. Learn</hi> (3.) That the Souls of ungodly Men are taken from them by force and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee;</hi> good Men have the ſame reluctancies of Nature which others have, yet they ſweetly reſign their Souls into the Hands of God, in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hour; whereas a wicked Man, tho' he ſometimes dyes by his own hand, yet never dyes with the conſent of his own Will; he chooſes rather to eat Duſt (with the Serpent) then to return to Duſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5) The Expoſtulatory Queſtion, <hi>Whoſe then ſhall theſe things be which thou haſt provided?</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, (1.) That they ſhould not be his: A Man's Wealth laſts no longer than his Life, neither has he any longer the comfort of it; lay up Gold, and it periſhes with thee; but Treaſure up Grace, and it ſhall accompany thee; whoſe ſhall theſe things be, not thine undoubtedly. (2.) As theſe things ſhall not be thine when thou art gone, ſo thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not whoſe they ſhall be after thou art gone; whether they ſhall fall into the hand of a Child or a Stranger, of a wiſe Man or a Fool; the Wealthieſt Man cannot be certain who ſhall be his Heir, and whoſe his Goods ſhall be. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> Laſtly, The Application which our Saviour makes of this Parable to his Diſciples, <hi>So is every one that layeth up Treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich towards God.

               <p>There is a Twofold ſenſe and interpretation given of theſe Verſes, (1.) Some take them as ſpoken only to the Apoſtles, directing them abſolutely to caſt off all care for the things of this Life, that ſo they might attend upon Chriſt's Perſon, and wholly give up themſelves to that Work to which he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them: and therefore St. <hi>Luke</hi> here takes notice, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had cautioned his Hearers in general againſt Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he applies himſelf particularly to his Diſciples, and tells them, that he would have them ſo far from this ſin of Covetouſneſs, that they ſhould not uſe that ordinary care, and common Induſtry about the things of this Life, which is not only Lawful, but Neceſſary for Men in all ordinary Caſes, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>And he ſaid to his Diſciples, therefore I ſay unto you, Take no thought for your Life, what ye ſhall eat or drink:</hi> but if we underſtand the words in this ſenſe, we muſt look upon it only as a Temporary Command, given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles for that time only, like that in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in your purſes, neither coat, nor ſcrip,</hi> which no Man ever underſtood as a general Law to all Chriſtians, but as a particular Precept to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at that time.

The Birds of the Air, the Beaſts of the Field, the Ravens of the Valley, are all fed and ſuſtained by God, without any care of their own, much more ſhall his Children. Has God a Breakfaſt ready for every little Bird that comes chirping out of its Neſt, and for every Beaſt of the Field, that comes leaping out of its Den, and will he not much more provide for you? Surely that God that feeds the Ravens when they cry, will not ſtarve his Children when they pray.</p>

That Heaven being once ſecured by us, all Earthly things ſhall be ſuperadded to us, as God ſees needful and convenient for us. But few Men like our Saviour's Method; they would ſeek the things of this World in the firſt place, and get Heaven at laſt; they would be content to ſeek the World, and to have Heaven thrown in without their ſeeking; but this will not be granted; if we make Religion and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Souls, our firſt and chief care, <hi>all other things ſhall be adaed to us,</hi> ſo far as the Wiſdom of God ſees them fit and convenient for us.</p>

               <p>The next Duty which our Saviour exhorts his Diſciples to, is the Duty of Alms-giving; that they ſhould be ſo far from diſtruſting God's Proviſion for themſelves, that they ſhould be always forward to a ready diſtribution towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea in caſes of Neceſſity, to be willing to ſell their Goods to relieve others; yet this precept is not to be taken as if it concerned all Perſons, at all times, and in all places; but reſpects only caſes of extreme Neceſſity; or if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all, it is only as to the readineſs and preparation of the Mind, that when Neceſſity calls for it, we be found willing to part with any thing we have for the Relief of Chriſt in his Members. <hi>Obſerve</hi> alſo the Argument uſed to excite to this Duty of Alms-giving; hereby we lay up our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in a ſafe hand, even in God's, who will reward us open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Bellies of the Poor are bags that wax not old, what is lodged there is laid up ſecurely out of the reach of danger; we imitate the wiſe Merchant in Tranſmitting our Eſtates into another World, by Bills of Exchange, where we are ſure to receive our own with Uſury.</p>

               <p>The next Duty Chriſt exhorts his Diſciples to, is that of Watchfulneſs, with Reference to his Second Coming, <hi>Let your Loyns be girded, and your Lights burning;</hi> the words may be underſtood two ways, ſpoken either in a martial phraſe, as to Soldiers, or in a Domeſtick as to Servants; if as to Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, then let your Loyns be girded, and your Lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is as much as that we ſhould be always ready for a March, having our Armour on, and our Match Light, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give fire at the firſt Alarm of Temptation. If the words are ſpoken as to Servants, then our Maſter bids us carefully expect his Second Coming, like a Lord's returning from a wedding Supper, (which uſed to be Celebrated in the Night) that they ſhould not put off their Cloaths, nor put out their Lights, but ſtand ready to open, tho' he comes at Midnight; when Chriſt comes, that Soul only ſhall have his Bleſſing, whom he finds watching.</p>
               <p n="37">37 Bleſſed are thoſe Servants, whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find watching, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them ſit down to meat, and will come

               <p>Here our Saviour makes uſe of ſeveral Arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Duty of Watchfulneſs upon his Diſciples; the firſt is drawn from the tranſcendent Reward which Chriſt will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon his watchful Servants, <hi>He will gird himſelf, make them ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them;</hi> a very high metaphorical Expreſſion; as if a Maſter ſhould be ſo tranſported with the diligence and faithfulneſs of his Servant, as to vouchſafe not only to let him ſit down to meat in his preſence, but to take the Napkin upon his Arm, and wait upon him himſelf at his Table. Lord! how poor and inconſiderable is that Service which the beſt of us do for thee, and yet thou ſpeakeſt of it, as if thou wert beholding to us for it. Thou doſt not only adminiſter to us a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but thou Miniſtereſt and waiteſt upon us at Supper, <hi>he will gird himſelf, and ſerve them.</hi> The Second Argument to excite to watchfulneſs, is drawn from the Benefit which we ſhall receive by watching in this Life; that let the Lord come when he will, whether in the Second or Third Watch, they ſhall be found ready and in a bleſſed Condition, who are found diligent in his Service, and waiting for his Appearance. <hi>Note</hi> here, (1.) The Son of Man will certainly come at one hour or other; (2.) at what Hour the Son of Man will come, cannot certainly be known. (3.) That there is no hour wherein we can promiſe our ſelves, that the Son of Man will not come. (4.) Very joyful will the Coming of the Son of Man be, if we be found upon our watch, and ready for his coming, <hi>Be ye therefore ready alſo, for the Son of Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at an hour when ye think not.</hi>

               <p>Theſe words may be applied theſe two ways, firſt to all the Faithful Servants of God in General; and then the <hi>Note</hi> is this, that for a Chriſtian to ſpend and end his days in the Service of Chriſt, and doing his Will, gives good aſſurance of a happy and bleſſed Condition, <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant.</hi> Secondly, Theſe words may be applied to the Miniſters of the Goſpel in ſpecial, and then <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Character and Duty of a Goſpel-Miniſter, he is the Steward of Chriſt's Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to give them their Meat in due Seaſon: (2.)

That Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and prudence are the indiſpenſable Qualifications of Chriſt's Stewards. (3.)

Our Faithfulneſs muſt reſpect God, our Selves, and our Flock; and includes integrity of Heart, purity of intention, induſtry of Endeavour, and impartiality in all our Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.

               <p>Our Lord in theſe Verſes deſcribes a negligent and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward of his Houſhold, and then declares that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence of Wrath which hangs over him. The unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward, or negligent Miniſter of the Goſpel is deſcribed, (1.) by his infidelity; he believeth not Chriſt's Coming to Judgment, tho' he preaches it to others; <hi>he ſaith in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming.</hi> (2.) He is deſcribed by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, envy, and malignity, againſt his Fellow Servants; that were more faithful than himſelf, <hi>He begins to ſmite them,</hi> at leaſt with the virulence of his Tongue, if not with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his hand. (3. He is farther deſcribed by his Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating with the wicked, and ſtrengthning their hands by his ill example, <hi>He eateth and drinketh with the drunken;</hi> that is, as their Aſſociate and Fellow Companion. Thus the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Steward, and unfaithful Miniſter is deſcribed: Next his Sentence is declared, (1.) Chriſt will ſurprize him in his ſin and ſecurity, <hi>by coming in an hour when he lookt not for him.</hi> (2.) He will execute temporal Vengeance upon him, <hi>He will cut him in pieces,</hi> as the Jews did their Sacrifices, dividing them into two parts. Hence ſome <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That God ſeldom ſuffers ſlothful, ſenſual Miniſters to Live out half their days. (3.)

               <p>Here we <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That whatever we receive from God, is both a Gift and a Talent. (2.) That every one has ſome Gift or Talent from God to be improved for God. (3.)

That anſwerable to our preſent Talents will be our future Accounts: If thy Gifts be mean, the leſs thou haſt to Account for; if greater then others, God

               <p>Our Saviour in theſe Verſes declares what will be the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Event and effect, but not the natural tendency of his Religion; ſo that we muſt diſtinguiſh between the intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aim of Chriſt's Coming, and the Accidental Event of it. Chriſt's intentional aim, was to plant, propagate, and promote Peace in the World; but thro' the Luſts and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Mens Natures, the iſſue and event of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is War and Diviſion, not that theſe are the genuine and natural Fruits of the Goſpel, but occaſional and accidental on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the preaching of the Goſpel, and ſetting up the Kingdom of Chriſt, tho' it be not the Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and Natural Cauſe, yet is it the accidental occaſion of all that War and Tumult, of all that Diſſention and Diviſion, of all that Diſtraction and Confuſion which the World abounds with; <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth.</hi> He is ſaid to ſend the fire of Diſſention, becauſe he foreſaw this would be the certain Conſequence, tho' not the proper and natural Effect of the Preaching of the Goſpel.

               <p>Our Saviour in theſe words does at once upbraid the ſtupid ignorance of the Jews in General, and the obſtinate infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Phariſees in particular, in that they could make a judgment of the Weather by the ſight of the Sky, by the appearance of the Heavens, and the motions of the Winds, but could not diſcern this Time of the Meſſias, tho' they had ſo many miraculous Signs and Evidences of it, and for this he upbraids them with Hypocriſy; <hi>Ye hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the sky, but ye do not diſcern this time. Learn</hi> thence, That to pretend either more Ignorance, or greater uncertainty in diſcerning the Signs of Goſpel Times, (the time of our gracious Viſitation) than the Signs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is great Hypocriſy; <hi>Ye hypocrites, can ye not diſcern this time? Obſerve</hi> farther, That Chriſt doth not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſtudy of Nature, or making Obſervation of the State of the Weather from the Face of the Sky: For Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by natural Signs, gives us warning of a Change in Natural things, and in like manner by his Providential Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, he gives us warning of a Change in Civil things; <hi>He that is wiſe will obſerve both,</hi> and by their Obſervation will come <hi>to underſtand the pleaſure of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>In theſe words our Saviour adviſes Perſons to uſe the ſame prudence in Divine Matters, which they uſe in Worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the ſame endeavours to ſeek Reconciliation with God, which they put forth in order to their being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto men; for in ſuch a Caſe, when they ſee an Action bringing againſt them, wherein they are ſure to be Caſt, their beſt way is preſently to ſeek to reconcile their Adverſary, and make their peace with him, that ſo they may eſcape the Threatning Danger. In like manner ſhould they do here, lay hold upon the preſent opportunity of Mercy now offered to them; becauſe 'tis a fearful thing to dye without Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God. <hi>Note</hi> here (1) That GOD and Man were once Friends.

               <p>There were two eminent Sects amongſt the Jews in our Saviour's Time, namely the <hi>Herodians</hi> and <hi>Galileans,</hi> the former ſtood ſtifly for having Tribute paid to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whoſe Subjects the Jews now were, but the <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (ſo called probably from <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 5.37.) oppoſed this Tribute, and often raiſed Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Power; <hi>Pilate</hi> takes the opportunity when theſe <hi>Galileans</hi> were come up at the Paſſover, and Sacrificing in the Temple, to fall upon them with his Soldiers, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly mingled their own blood with the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which they offered; neither the Holineſs of the place, (the Temple) nor the Sacredneſs of the Action, (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing) could divert <hi>Pilate</hi> from this barbarous Impiety.

That a violent and ſudden Death is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's disfavour. (2.)

               <p>Another inſtance our Saviour gives of perſons that fell by a ſudden Death, even eighteen that were ſlain by the fall of a Tower in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> he takes occaſion from thence to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Jews, that they do not rigidly cenſure the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or conclude that thoſe have wrought the moſt Sin, who

Telling the whole Body of the Jews, that if they did not Repent, they ſhould all likewiſe periſh, and that two ways, (1.) <hi>Certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine poenae,</hi> by as certain a puniſhment as theſe did; (2.) ye ſhall likewiſe periſh, <hi>Similitudine poenae,</hi> by the ſame kind of puniſhment, you ſhall periſh by the ruine of your whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they did by the downfal of that Tower; if a timely and ſincere Repentance doth not intervene. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That we muſt judge of Perſons by their Converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, not by God's Diſpenſations towards them; all things here fall alike to all, a ſudden Death, yea a violent Death, as it comes upon many men, ſo it may come upon the beſt of Men, as well as others; think not, ſays Chriſt, that theſe eighteen were ſinners above all that dwelt in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things, <hi>I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> Teaching us, that Repentance is the only way and means to prevent puniſhment here, and periſhing hereafter, <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall periſh.</hi>

Laſtly,</hi> If after all the Coſt that God has beſtowed upon a People by his Miniſters and Ordinances, they continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, there is nothing to be expected but exciſion and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deſtruction, cut it down, why cumbereth it the Ground.</p>

Our Lord's Vindication of himſelf from Calumny and falſe Accuſation; (1.) He charges his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer with Hypocriſy, <hi>Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you looſe his Ox or his Aſs from the ſtall on the Sabbath-day, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him?</hi> It is one Note of an Hypocrite, to condemn that in another which he doth himſelf; the Jews held it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to looſe and lead a Beaſt to watering on the Sabbath-day, which was a work of Servile Labour, and yet would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Chriſt for healing a poor Woman, only with a word ſpeaking. (2.) Chriſt vindicates his own Action, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with theirs, which they judged lawful on the Sabbath-day: was their looſing and watering the Beaſt, a Work of Neceſſity? much more was his: Was theirs a work of Mercy? his much more; their compaſſion was to a Bruit Beaſt, his to a rational Creature, to a Woman; and that not to a ſtranger, an Heathen Woman, but one of their own, a Jewiſh Woman, a Daughter of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Nay farther Chriſt's Act was an Act of far greater Neceſſity, and more ſpecial Mercy then theirs. The Beaſt might live a day without Water; the Beaſt might not be ſick, but this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was in ſore diſtreſs, and had been ſo for eighteen years; nay ſhe was in the hands of the Enemy of Mankind, bound by Satan, Was it not then a greater Act of Mercy, and Compaſſion to looſe her, than to lead a Beaſt. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (6.)

               <p>Our Saviour's Deſign in both theſe Parables, is to keep his Diſciples and Followers from being offended at the ſmall Beginnings of his Kingdom, and to fore-tell the future great Succeſs of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding the preſent ſmall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the efficacy of it; to this purpoſe he compares the Kingdom of God, that is, the Goſpel-Church, <hi>to a grain of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> which being one of the leaſt Seeds, yet in that Country grew into ſo large a Tree, that the Birds did Rooſt and Lodge in the Boughs of it.

Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The Metaphor which Chriſt is pleaſed to ſet forth Heaven and the Happineſs of a future State by, he compares it to a <hi>ſtreight gate;</hi> to a <hi>Gate,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the poſſibility of entring; to a <hi>ſtreight gate,</hi> to denote the difficulty of Entrance; a Gate ſuppoſes the entrance poſſible, but a ſtreight gate beſpeaks the Entrance difficult.

Chriſt hereby repreſented to the Jews, the great danger they were in if they neglected the preſent Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Grace and Salvation, which now they did enjoy; telling them farther, how little it would profit them at the day of Judgment, to alledge that they had eaten and drunk in his preſence, that they had heard him preach in their ſtreets, if they did not forſake their ſins, and obey his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Adding farther, that it would be an Heart-piercing ſorrow, a Soul-rending grief to them, at the Great Day, to ſee not only the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and other Jews, but even the deſpiſed Gentiles from all Quarters and Nations, whom they thought accurſed, admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven, and themſelves eternally ſhut out; <hi>For the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the first laſt;</hi> that is, the Gentiles who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off ſhall receive the Goſpel, when you for rejecting it ſhall be caſt off. From the whole <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That there is a determinate time when Souls muſt (if ever) accept of the offers of Grace and Salvation, which are made unto them; now is the door open, and Perſons invited in. (2.) That e're long Jeſus Chriſt, who now ſtands at every one of our doors, waiting for our complyance with his Goſpel-Terms, will wait no longer upon us, nor ſtrive any farther by the motions of his Spirit with us, <hi>when once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and ſhut to the door.</hi> (3.) That doleful is the condition of ſuch miſerable Souls againſt whom the door is ſhut, the door of Repentance, the door of hope, the door of Salvation; all ſhut, eternally ſhut, and that by him, who ſhutteth and none can open. (4.)

Note</hi> (5.) That it is no good plea for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into Heaven, becauſe we have been Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers here on Earth; no outward priviledges, tho' Chriſt has taught in our Streets; no external Acts of Communion, tho' we have eaten and drunk in his preſence, and at his holy Table, will juſtify our hopes of entring into Heaven when we dye, if we be workers of iniquity whilſt we live; <hi>Lord, we have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, but he ſhall ſay, I know you not, ye workers of iniquity.

               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, that the Phariſees who had no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for our Saviour, ſhould come here and acquaint him with a danger that he was in from <hi>Herod; Get thee hence, for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod will kill thee.</hi> It is probable they had a deſign to drive him out of the Country, becauſe his Reputation was ſo great among the People, who were admirers of his Perſon, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of his Doctrine, and Witneſſes of his Miracles.

Again, as the Hen continueth her Call to her young ones from Morning to Night, and holds out her Wings for ſhelter to them all the day long, ſo did Chriſt wait for this Peoples Repentance and Converſion; for it was more than Forty years after they had killed his Prophets, and murthered himſelf, before they met with a final Overthrow. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.)

The Houſe he goes into, and is entertain'd in, one of the chief Phariſees, who were ſome of his chiefeſt Enemies; a great inſtance of our Lord's humanity, humility, and ſelf-denial, in that he refuſes not the Converſation of thoſe whom he knew did not affect him; teaching us to Love our Enemies, and not to ſhun Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them, that thereby we may gain an opportunity of being reconciled to them. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) The day when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour dined publickly at the Phariſees Houſe, among the Lawyers and Phariſees, it was on the Sabbath-day. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That it is not ſinfully unlawful for us to entertain our Friends and Neighbours with a plentiful Meal on the Lord's day; it muſt be acknowledged, that Feaſting upon any day is one of thoſe Lawful things which is difficultly managed without Sin, but more eſpecially upon that day, that it does not unfit us for the Duties of the Sabbath: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, our Lord's Example in going to a publick Dinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Lawyers and Phariſees, evidently ſhews the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of feaſting on that day, provided we uſe the ſame mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in eating and drinking that he did, and improve the opportunity as a Seaſon for doing good, as he has taught us by his Example. <hi>Note</hi> (4.) How contrary to all the Laws of Behaviour, the Decency of Converſation, and the Rules of Hoſpitality, the Phariſees watched him, making their Table a Snare to catch him, hoping they might hear ſomething from him, or ſee ſomething in him, for which they might accuſe him; <hi>He entered into the houſe of the Phariſee to eat Bread, and they watched him. Note</hi> (5.) Our Saviour choſe the Sabbath-day as the fitteſt Seaſon to work his miraculous Cures in; in the Phariſees Houſe he heals a Man that had the Dropſy on the Sabbath-day. Chriſt would not forbear doing good, nor omit an opportunity of helping and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtreſſed, tho' he knew his Enemies the Phariſees would carp and cavil at it, calumniate and reproach him for it; it being the conſtant guiſe of Hypocrites, to prefer Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial and Ritual Obſervations, before Neceſſary and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties. <hi>Note</hi> (6.) How our Saviour defends the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Act in Healing the diſeaſed Man, from their own Act in helping the Beaſt out of the Pit on the Sabbath-day; as if Chriſt had ſaid, Is it lawful for you on the Sabbath-day to help a Beaſt? and is it ſinful in me to heal a Man? <hi>Note</hi> Laſtly, How the Reaſon and Force of our Saviour's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſilenced the Phariſees, convinced them no doubt, but we read nothing of their Converſion; the obſtinate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious are much harder to be wrought upon, than the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Scandalous; it is eaſier to ſilence ſuch Men then to ſatisfy them, to ſtop their Mouths than to remove their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; for Obſtinacy will hold the Concluſion, tho' Reaſon cannot maintain the Premiſes; <hi>They could not anſwer him again to theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 And he put forth a Parable to thoſe that were bidden, when he marked how they choſe out the chief Rooms, ſaying unto them. 8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, ſit not down in the higheſt Room, leſt a more honourable perſon than thou be bidden of him. 9 And he that bade thee and him, come and ſay to thee, Give this man place, and thou begin with ſhame to take the loweſt Room. 10 But when thou art bidden, go and ſit down in the loweſt Room, and when he that bade thee cometh, he may ſay unto thee, Friend, go up higher; then ſhalt thou have Worſhip in the preſence of them that ſit at meat with thee. 11 For whoſoever exalteth himſelf ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved before that our Bleſſed Saviour Dined publickly on the Sabbath day with ſeveral Phariſees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; that which is here worthy of our Notice is this, how holy and ſuitable our Lord's Diſcourſe was to the Solemnity of that day, may it be the matter of our imitation; it is not unlawful for Friends to Dine together on the Lord's Day, provided their Diſcourſe be ſuitable to the Day, ſuch was our Lord's here; for obſerving how the Company then at Table did affect precedency and taking place one of another: he that before their Eyes had Cured a Man of a Bodily Dropſy, attempts to Cure the Perſons that Dined with him of the Tympany of Pride. Where <hi>Note,</hi> That it is not the Taking, but the Affecting the higheſt Places and uppermoſt Rooms, that our Saviour condemns: There may and ought to be a Precedency amongſt Perſons; it is according to the Will of God, <hi>That Honour is given to whom Honour is due;</hi> and that the more Honourable Perſons ſhould ſit in the moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places; for Grace gives a Man no exteriour Preference: it makes a Man glorious indeed, but it is glorious within. <hi>Note</hi> farther, the way and courſe, the method and means which our Saviour directs Perſons to, in order to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining real Honour, both from GOD and Men, namely, by being little in our own Eyes, <hi>and in lowlineſs of mind, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others better than our ſelves;</hi> as GOD will abaſe, and Men will deſpiſe the proud and haughty; ſo GOD will exalt, and Men will honour the humble Perſon; <hi>Whoſoever exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 Then ſaid he alſo to him that bade, when thou makeſt a Dinner or a Supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren; neither thy kinſmen, nor thy rich neighbours, leſt they alſo bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. 13 But when thou makeſt a Feaſt, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind. 14 And thou ſhalt be bleſſed, for they cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thee, for thou ſhalt be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the juſt.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour obſerving how the Phariſee that bade him to Dinner invited only the Rich, over-looking and neglecting the Poor, he exhorts him and the Company, that whenever they make Entertainments for the time to come, they ſhould not only invite their rich Neighbours and Friends, who can and will invite them again, but remember the Poor. Here <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That Civil Courteſies, and Hoſpitable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kindred and Friends, for maintaining and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Love and Concord, is not only Lawful, but an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and neceſſary Duty; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe hoſpitality to one another</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Peter) without grudging.</hi> (2.) That altho' it be not lawful to invite and feaſt the Rich, yet is it moſt acceptable to God, when we feed and refreſh the Poor; <hi>When thou makeſt a Feaſt, call rather the poor, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed.</hi> We muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Duties of Chriſtian Charity before Acts of Common Civility; Bleſſed are thoſe Feaſt-makers, who make the Bowels of the Hungry to Bleſs them. (3.) That God oft-times Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Liberality to the poor very ſignally in this Life; but if it be deferr'd, we ſhall not fail to receive it at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Juſt; <hi>The poor cannot recompence thee, but thou ſhalt be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 And when one of them that ſate at meat with him heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat Bread in the kingdom of God. 16 Then ſaid he unto him, A certain man made a great Supper, and bade many. 17 And ſent his Servant at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-time
<pb facs="tcp:46556:107"/> to ſay to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. 18 And they all, with one conſent, began to make excuſe: The firſt ſaid unto him, I have bought a piece of Ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it; I pray thee have me excuſed. 19 And another ſaid, I have bought five yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them, I pray thee have me excuſed. 20 And another ſaid, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 21 So that the ſervant came and ſhewed his Lord theſe things. Then the maſter of the houſe being angry, ſaid to his Servant, Go out quickly into the ſtreets and lanes of the City, and bring in hither the poor and the maimed, the halt and the blind. 22 And the ſervant ſaid, Lord, it is done as thou haſt commanded, and yet there is room. 23 And the Lord ſaid unto the ſervant, go into the High-ways and Hedges, and compel them to come in, that my houſe may be filled. 24 For I ſay unto you, None of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper.</p>
               <p>One of them that ſate at meat with our Saviour in the Phariſees Houſe, hearing Chriſt ſpeak of being Recompenc'd at the Reſurrection of the Juſt, repeated that known ſaying among the Rabbins, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the kingdom of God;</hi> that is, who ſhall be partaker of the Joys of Heaven. Hereupon Chriſt utters the Parable of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Supper, Recorded here by St. <hi>Luke</hi> with ſmall variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from what was delivered by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Ch. 22. The firſt intention of our Saviour in that Parable ſeems to be this, to ſet forth that gracious offer of Mercy and Salvation which was made by the preaching of the Goſpel unto the Jews, and to declare God's purpoſe of Receiving the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles into the Fold of Chriſt, upon the Jews deſpiſing and rejecting that ineſtimable Favour. But beſides this, it has an aſpect upon us Chriſtians, who have embraced the Doctrine of the Goſpel. Here <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That the Goſpel for its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fulneſs, for its varieties and delicacies, is like a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Supper; For (1.) it does create the ſame Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers that Marriage doth between Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife; (2.) it entitles to the ſame Priviledges that a Conjugal Relation doth, to the ſame endearing Love and Tenderneſs, to the ſame Care and Protection, to the ſame Honour, and to the ſame Happineſs; (3.) It obliges to the like Duties, namely, unſpotted Love and fidelity, chearful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Commands, reverence to his Perſon, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Authority. (4.) It produces the ſame Effects; as the Effect of Marriage is increaſe of Children, ſo the fruit of the Goſpel, is <hi>bringing many ſons to God. Note</hi> (2.) That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel invitations are mightily diſeſteemed; they made light of the invitation, and offered frivolous Excuſes for their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of it. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) That the preference which the World has in Mens eſteem, is the great Cauſe of the Goſpel-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; <hi>one had purchaſed a piece of Ground,</hi> another had <hi>bought five yoke of Oxen. Note</hi> (4.) The deplorable ſadneſs of their Condition, who refuſe upon any pretence whatever, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Goſpel-Tender of Reconciliation and Mercy: <hi>The King was wrath,</hi> pronounced them <hi>unworthy of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and reſolved they ſhould not taſte of his Supper,</hi> but ſends forth his Servants to invite others to the Supper. <hi>Note</hi> (5.) The Notion under which the Gentiles are ſet forth unto us, ſuch as were in <hi>Lanes, Streets,</hi> and <hi>High-ways;</hi> that is, a rude, ruſtick, barbarous People, whom the Jews deſpiſed, yea, whom they held Accurſed, yet even theſe are called and accepted, whilſt the Jews, the firſt intended Gueſts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by means of their own Contempt. <hi>Note</hi> laſtly, The means uſed to bring in the Gentiles to the Goſpel-Supper; <hi>Go and compel them to come in;</hi> not by Violence, but perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by Argumentation, not Compulſion; the plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive, the powerful and efficacious Preaching of the Word, with the Motions and influences of the Holy Spirit, are the Compulſion here intended; not external Force, not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhments, not outward Violence; <hi>Non Religionis eſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere Religionem,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian;</hi> No Man ought by Force and Violence to be compelled to the Profeſſion of the true Faith.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And there were great multitudes with him, and he turned and ſaid unto them. 26 If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. 27 And whoſoever doth not bare his croſs and come after me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour by theſe Expreſſions doth not condemn na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Love and Affection, either to our Relations, or our own Lives, but only regulates and directs it, ſhewing that our firſt and chief Love muſt be beſtowed upon himſelf; we may have, and ought to cheriſh tender and relenting affections towards our near and dear Relations: But then the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Chriſt's Truth and Religion muſt take place of theſe; yea, of Life it ſelf; and when they ſtand in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with theſe, we are to regard them no more, then if they were the Objects of our Hatred. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That no Man can be a ſincere Diſciple of Chriſt, who gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Relation, or outward Enjoyment, a preference to Chriſt in his Heart and Affections. Chriſt muſt be Loved above all, or we Love him not at all; leſs Love he accounts and calls Hatred. (2.) That all the Diſciples of Chriſt muſt be ready and willing whenever called to it, to quit all their Temporal Intereſts and Enjoyments, even Life it ſelf, and ſubmit to any Temporal Inconveniencies, even Death it ſelf, and all this willingly and chearfully, rather than diſown their Relation to Chriſt, and quit the Profeſſion of his Holy Religion; upon eaſier Terms than theſe, can none of us be the Diſciples of Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="28">28 For which of you intending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt, whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it? 29 Leſt haply after he hath laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it, begin to mock him. 30 ſaying, This man began to build, and was not able to finiſh. 31 Or, What King cometh to make War againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand? 32 Or elſe, while the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an Ambaſſage, and deſireth Conditions of peace. 33 So likewiſe whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour by theſe two Parables, adviſes all his Followers to ſit down and conſider, to weigh well, and caſt up before hand what it is like to coſt them, to go through with their Profeſſion of Religion: This he tells us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence will direct Men to do in other Caſes; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when they either go to Build or to fight; as a Man that intends to Build, will conſult whither he is able to defray the Charge; and a King that goes forth to War, will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ſtrength he has to make Oppoſition; in like manner ſhould Perſons engage in Religion; not raſhly, but adviſedly, with Conſideration and Judgment; It is good to remember the Iſſues of Action before we Act, before we engage in the ſpiritual Combate to conſider the difficulty of the Battle; What proud Leviathans we have to Conflict with, what migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gyants to contend and ſtrive againſt, even the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. But then we muſt take great care that our Deliberation and Conſideration of Difficulties and Dangers may not deter us from, but work in us a ſteady Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for the Combat, looking up to Chriſt for his Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Aid and Strength, to render us Victorious, who tho' of our ſelves we can do nothing, yet <hi>may do all things through Chriſt</hi> that ſtrengthens us. <hi>Learn</hi> from hence, That ſuch as take up a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, without conſidering the dangers and difficulties, the Tryals and Troubles, the Afflictions and Temptations which may accompany it, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:46556:107"/> hold out in the ſpiritual Warfare, but either fall in it, or run from it.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Salt is good, but if the Salt have loſt his ſavour, wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned? 35 It is neither fit for the Land, nor yet for the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, but men caſt it out: he that hath ears to hear let him hear.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here compares his Diſciples to Salt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by denoting their Uſefulneſs, Salt being one of the moſt uſeful things in Nature; and pointing alſo out their Duty, which is to Seaſon themſelves and others with ſound Doctrine. But Hypocritical Profeſſors are like unſavory Salt, they are neither ſavory in themſelves, nor ſerviceable to others; our Saviour compares ſuch Chriſtians who have no ſavour of Piety and Goodneſs upon their Spirits to Salt, that having loſt its Goodneſs, is neither fit for the Land, nor yet for the Dunghil; that is, being of a brackiſh Nature, it is wholly unfit to manure the Ground, and will rather occaſion Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then any Fruitfulneſs of Encreaſe. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſincere and ſerious Chriſtians, are and will be as the Salt of the Earth, that is, good and ſavory in themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring by good Exhortation and good Example to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon others: But hypocritical Profeſſors and Apoſtatizing Chriſtians will be caſt out, and trampled upon as unſavory Salt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> This Chapter conſiſts of three Parables; the deſign and ſcope of them all is this, to repreſent the great tenderneſs and compaſſion of God Almighty, towards the vileſt and worſt of ſinners upon their ſincere Repentance, and how highly pleaſing it is to God when they do ſo; This is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by three Parables, <hi>(1.)</hi> Of a man's ſeeking diligently a Sheep that he had loſt, and having found it, rejoycing greatly, and inviting his Neighbours to partake of his Joy. <hi>(2.)</hi> Of a Woman having loſt a piece of Silver, and ſeeking carefully till ſhe had found it; and then in like manner rejoycing with her Friends, for her good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. <hi>(3.)</hi> Of a prodigal Son, who having ſpent his Time and conſumed his Eſtate in Riot and Exceſs, at length returns to his Father's Houſe, and is joyfully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THen drew near unto him all the Publicans and ſinners, for to hear him. 2 And the Phariſees and Scribes murmured, ſaying, This man receiveth ſinners, and eateth with them.</p>
               <p>The Publicans and Sinners, as they had done ſeveral times before, came to hear our Saviour's Inſtructions; he treated them very kindly, and converſed familiarly with them; at this the Phariſees were diſpleaſed, and murmured, cenſuring our Saviour for too much Familiarity with thoſe Men, whom they look'd upon as Scandalous to Converſe with; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that he Convers'd with them as their Phyſician, not as their Companion, and therefore his proper Work and Employment lay among his Patients; and that he might give all poſſible Encouragement to the Repentance of the greateſt Sinners, he ſets forth at once the tender care of God in Recovering ſuch loſt Sinners, and the inexpreſſible Joy that is found in Heaven at the welcome News of their Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, for thus it follows in the Parables.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And he ſpake this Parable unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 4 What man of you having an hundred Sheep, if he loſe one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the Wilderneſs, and go after that which is loſt until he find it. 5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders rejoycing. 6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his Friends and Neighbours, ſaying unto them, Rejoyce with me, for I have found my ſheep that was loſt. 7 I ſay unto you, That likewiſe joy ſhall be in Heaven over one ſinner that Repenteth, more then over ninety and nine juſt perſons, that need no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>In this Parable Chriſt compares Sinners to Sheep going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and God the Father to a tender and careful Shepherd, ſeeking his ſtray Sheep, wherein he ſecretly Taxes the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees for their Uncharitableneſs in cenſuring him for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with Publicans and Sinners, and for their Envy at the Recovery of ſuch Sinners by Repentance, aſſuring them, that they are far from the temper of the Holy Angels, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce more at the News of one Notorious Sinners Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then for many Righteous Perſons who went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray; like as a Father is touched with a more ſenſible Joy, for the Recovery of one Son who was dangerouſly ſick, then for the Health of all the reſt who were in no ſuch Danger. From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That the Creatures Aberration may ſerve for our Inſtruction; the Sheeps ſtraying away from us, ſhould put us in mind of our wandring away from God. (2.) That Chriſt the great Shepherd of his Church, with vigilancy and care, ſeeketh up, and findeth out his loſt Sheep, and will never give over his ſearch, till he hath found them. (3.) That the Recovery of one loſt Sinner by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is matter of exceeding Joy and Rejoycing to Chriſt the great Shepherd, and to all the Bleſſed Company of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>There is joy in Heaven over one ſinner that Repenteth,</hi> or changeth the whole Courſe of his Life, <hi>more then over Ninety and nine juſt Perſons that need no ſuch Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 Either what Woman having ten pieces of Silver, if ſhe loſe one piece, doth not light a Candle, and ſweep the houſe, and ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently till ſhe find it? 9 And when ſhe hath found it, ſhe calleth her Friends and her Neighbours together, ſaying, Rejoyce with me, for I have found the piece which I had loſt. 10 Likewiſe I ſay unto you, there is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that Repenteth.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of this Parable is the ſame with the former; (1.) To expreſs the Joy that is found with GOD and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, at the Recovery and Converſion of a notorious Sinner. (2.) To juſtify Chriſt in Converſing with ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in order to their Repentance and Converſion, from the malicious Reflections of the Phariſees made upon our Saviour for ſo doing; the ſenſe of the words ſeems to be this, If you do all juſtify the diligence and care of a Woman, uſing all poſſible means to recover the loſs of a piece of Silver, that had <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Image upon it, why (might our Saviour ſay) will you Phariſees Cenſure and Condemn me for ſeeking to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſave loſt Sinners, that have the Image of an Holy God inſtampt upon them? <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner from a Courſe and State of Sin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, is highly acceptable and pleaſing unto God. (2.) That it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Holy Angels in Heaven do conceive a new joy at the notice and news of a Sinners Repentance and Converſion unto God; how the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels come by this Knowledge, whether by vertue of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry here below, or whether God is pleaſed to reveal it to them above, as a thing extremely welcome and delightful to good Spirits, 'tis neither material to enquire, nor poſſible to determine. But their Happineſs not being intenſively infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it is certain that they may be Happier than they are. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) That God is not only willing to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Repenting and Returning Sinners, but the News of their Repentance is entertain'd with ſo much joy in Heaven, that if it be poſſible for the Bleſſed Inhabitants of that place to have any thing added to their Happineſs, this will be a new Acceſſion to it: For tho' the Happineſs of God himſelf be intenſively infinite, and can have nothing added to it; yet the Happineſs of Angels and glorified Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but finite, is capable of Addition; and as their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Love do encreaſe, ſo their Felicity may be grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving to all Eternity; ſo that it is reaſonable enough to ſuppoſe, that there is really joy among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

               <p n="11">11 And he ſaid, A certain man had two ſons. 12 And the younger of them ſaid to his Father, Father give me the portion of Goods that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to me, and he divided to them his Living. 13 And not many days after, the younger Son gathered all together, and took his Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far Country, and there waſted his Subſtance with riotous Living. 14 And when he had ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty Famine in that Land, and he began to be in want. 15 And he went and joined himſelf to a Citizen of that Country, and he ſent him into his Fields to feed Swine. 16 And he would fain have filled his Belly with the Husks that the Swine did eat, and no man gave unto him. 17 And when he came to himſelf he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my Fathers have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger? 18 I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee. 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants. 20 And he aroſe and came to his Father; but when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on him, and ran and fell on his Neck, and kiſſed him. 21 And the Son ſaid unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. 22 But the Father ſaid to his Servants, Bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his Hand, and Shooes on his Feet. 23 And bring hither the fatted Calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry. 24 For this my Son was dead, and is alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he was loſt and is found, and they began to be merry.</p>
               <p>In the two former Parables of the loſt Sheep and loſt Groat, was Repreſented to us the great pains and care which Chriſt takes for the Recovery of loſt Sinners. In this third Parable of the Prodigal Son, is ſhadowed forth unto us, with what great readineſs, joy and gladneſs our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receives repenting and returning Sinners. In the Face of this Prodigal, as in a Glaſs, we may behold, firſt, a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous Sinners Averſion from God, ſecondly, a penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Converſion to God, thirdly, a pardoned Sinners Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Entertainment with God. From the whole <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) What is the Nature of Sin, and the Practice of Sinners; Sin is a departing from God, and every Sinner doth volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and of his own accord, depart from him; <hi>He took his Journey into a far Country. Learn</hi> (2.) The great extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy which Sinners run into when they forſake God, and give up themſelves to the Conduct of their Luſts and vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; he waſted all his Subſtance <hi>with riotous Living;</hi> that is, ſpent his Time, and conſumed his Treaſure <hi>in riot and exceſs.</hi> (3.) <hi>Obſerve</hi> That ſin will certainly bring Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Streights, but Streights do not always bring Men off from ſin; <hi>he began to be in want,</hi> yet thinks not of returning to his Fathers Houſe. (4.) That ſinners will try all ways, and go through the greateſt Hardſhips and Difficulties before they will leave their ſins, and return home to their Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>He joined himſelf to a Citizen of that Country, and went into the Fields to feed Swine;</hi> he chooſes rather to feed at the Hogs Trough, then to Feaſt in his Fathers Houſe. (5.) <hi>Obſerve</hi> at laſt the happy Fruits of a Sanctified Affliction, they put the prodigal upon ſerious Conſideration, <hi>he came to himſelf:</hi> upon wiſe Conſultation, <hi>I periſh for hunger;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fixed Reſolution, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father;</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration, and ſolid Reſolution, are great ſteps to a ſound Converſion and thorough Reformation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (6.) The affectionate tenderneſs and compaſſion of the Father towards the returning Prodigal, tho' he had deſerved to be ſharply reproved, ſeverely Corrected, and finally rejected and ſhut out of doors; yet the Fathers Compaſſion is above his Anger; not a word of his miſcarriages drops from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Mouth, but as ſoon as ever the Son looks back, mercy looks out, and the Father expreſſes (1.) His ſpeedy readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive his ſon, <hi>he ran unto him;</hi> the Son did only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and go, but the Father made haſte and ran; Mercy has not only a quick eye to ſpy out a Penitent, but a ſwift Foot, it runs to embrace a Penitent. (2.) Wonderful Tenderneſs, <hi>he fell upon his neck;</hi> it had been much to have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with the Eye, more to have taken him by the hand, but moſt of all to fall upon his Neck. Divine Mercy will not only meet a Penitent, but embrace him alſo. (3.) Strong Affectionateneſs, <hi>he kiſſed him;</hi> giving him thereby a pledge and aſſurance of perfect Friendſhip and Reconciliation with him. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That God is not only ready to give Demonſtrations of his Mercy to penitent ſinners, but alſo to give the Seals and Tokens of his ſpecial Reconciled Favour to them, they ſhall now have the kiſſes of his Lips, who formerly deſerved the blows of his Hand; <hi>The Father ran un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, fell on his Neck and kiſſed him. Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The great joy that appeared in the whole Houſe, as well as in the Fathers Heart, upon this great occaſion, the prodigal Sons returning, <hi>They all began to be merry,</hi> there was Muſick and Dancing. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That ſincere Converſion brings the Soul into a joyful, into a very joyful State and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The joy that Converſion brings, is an holy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy, a ſolid and ſubſtantial joy, a wonderful and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent joy, an encreaſing and never fading joy; our joy on Earth is an earneſt of the joys of Heaven; where there will be Rejoycing in the preſence of our Heavenly Father, and his Holy Angels to all Eternity; <hi>Becauſe we were dead, but are now alive again, we were loſt but are found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25 Now his elder ſon was in the field; and as he came and drew nigh to the houſe, he heard Muſick and Dancing. 26 And he called one of the Servants, and asked what theſe things meant. 27 And he ſaid unto him, Thy Brother is come, and thy Father hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fatted Calf, becauſe he hath received him ſafe and ſound. 28 And he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and would not go in, therefore came his Father out and entreated him. 29 And he anſwering ſaid to his Father, Lo! theſe many years do I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy Commandment, and yet thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gaveſt me a kid, that I might make merry with my Friends. 30 But as ſoon as this thy ſon was come, which hath devoured thy Living with Harlots, thou haſt killed for him the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Calf. 31 And he ſaid unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. 32 It was meet that we ſhould make merry and be glad, For this thy Brother was dead, and is alive again, he was loſt, and is found.</p>
               <p>By the murmurings of the Elder Son at the Prodigals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to, and Reception with his Father; ſome think the Jews in general are to be underſtood, whoſe peeviſhneſs to the Gentiles, and their Repinings at the offer of Salvation, made unto them by the Goſpel, is very evident from many places of Scripture; others underſtand it of the Scribes and Phariſees in particular, who preſuming on their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as if they had never tranſgreſſed God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments at any time, murmured at our Saviour for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Sinners, tho' it were in order to the bringing of them to Repentance; which inſtead of being frowardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at, they ought to have rejoyced in. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, There is ſuch an envious Spirit in Men, yea even in the beſt

               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having declared to his Followers in the foregoing Verſes, the great advantage they ſhall reap by a charitable Diſtribution of Temporal good things, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them in theſe Verſes with the great Detriment and Diſadvantage that will redound to them if they do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. (1.) If they be not Faithful in right employing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Riches, they muſt not expect that God will intruſt them with Spiritual and Heavenly; which are the true Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: God will deal with his Servants, as we deal with ours, never truſt them with much, whom we find unfaithful in a little, (2.) If they be not faithful in the improvement of theſe outward things, which God intruſts them with but for a time, and muſt ſhortly leave them to others; how can they expect that God ſhould give them thoſe Spiritual good things which ſhall never be taken away from them to whom they are given. Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That the Riches we have are called not our own, but another Mans, <hi>If ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans;</hi> Becauſe God has not made us Proprietors, but diſpenſers, not owners, but Stewards of theſe things; we have them for others, and muſt leave them to others; we are only Truſtees for the Poor; if much be put into our hands, it is to diſpenſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, according to our Maſters Order; let us be Faithful then in that which is another Mans, that is, with what God puts into our hand for the Benefit of others. (2.) <hi>Note,</hi> That tho' our Gifts are not our own, yet Grace or Spiritual Goods are our own; others may have all the Benefit of our Gifts, but we ſhall have the benefit and comfort of our own Grace; this Treaſure we cannot leave to others, and it ſhall never be taken away from our ſelves. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) That God is juſt, and will be eternally juſtified in denying his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grace to thoſe, who do not make uſe of his common Gifts; would Men be Faithful in improving a little, GOD would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt them with more; did they not abuſe the Truſt of his common Gifts, he would not deny them the Treaſure of his Saving Grace, called here, <hi>the true Riches.</hi>

That no Man can ſerve theſe two Maſters, who are of contrary Intereſts, and iſſue out contrary Commands; when two Maſters are Subordinate, and their Commands ſubſervient each to other, the difficulty of ſerving both is not great; But where Commands interfere, and Intereſts claſh, it is impoſſible; no Man can ſerve GOD and the World, but he may ſerve GOD with the World; we may be ſerved of Riches, and yet ſerve God, but we cannot ſerve Riches but we muſt diſſerve God; we cannot ſerve GOD and the World both, and ſeek them as our chief Good and ultimate End, becauſe no Man can divide his Heart betwixt GOD and the World. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That to Love the World as our chief Good, to ſeek it as our higheſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and to ſerve it as our chief Commander, cannot ſtand with the Love and Service which we bear and owe to God our Maker.

               <p>Our Saviour in theſe words gives the Phariſees to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that their contempt of his Perſon and Doctrine was the more inexcuſable, becauſe they lived in and under the cleareſt Light of the Goſpel; The Preaching of the Law and the Prophets continued but till <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, ſince which time the Goſpel has been clearly Preached, both by him, and my ſelf unto you; and it has pleaſed God to give my Doctrine great acceptation in the World, tho' you Phariſees reject it; yet every one, that is, very many preſs into it; ſo that the Doctrine which you mock, the Holy Doctrine of the Goſpel, others will embrace; yet leſt whilſt Chriſt ſpake thus highly of the Goſpel, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſhould reproach him as a Deſtroyer of the Law, he ſhews that the Obligation of the Moral Law was of Eternal Force, and that Heaven and Earth ſhould ſooner paſs, then the Obligation of that Law ceaſe; which yet the Phariſees moſt ſhamefully violated, particularly the Seventh Commandment, which they break by permitting and practiſing Divorces, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unjuſtifiable Grounds. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the Moral Law, in all the Branches of it, which is ſummarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Ten Commandments, is an Eternal Rule of Life and Manners, which is to ſtand in force as long as the World ſtands, and the frame of Heaven and Earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.</p>
               <p n="19">19 There was a certain rich man, who was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day. 20 And there was a certain Beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full of Sores. 21 And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans Table; moreover the Dogs came and licked his Sores.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour in this Parabolical Hiſtory of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> inſtructs us concerning the right uſe of Riches, which is to capacitate us to do good to others, declaring that in the Life to come, the pious poor man ſhall be eternally Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whilſt the unmerciful rich Man ſhall be intolerably miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Here <hi>Obſerve,</hi> (1.) That our Saviour did not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Rich Man for being Rich, but for being ſenſual, not
<pb facs="tcp:46556:109"/> for wearing coſtly Apparel, and keeping a plentiful Table, (which, if managed according to Mens Qualities and Eſtates is a commendable Vertue) but his Senſuality and Luxury, and forgetting to feed the Hungry with the Superfluities of his Table; theſe are the things for which he is Cenſured. From whence me may <hi>Learn,</hi> That Pride and Luxury, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Senſuality, are ſuch abuſes of Worldly Riches as Worldly Men are very prone and incident to. Rich Men too often make their Back and their Belly their God; Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing and Devoting all they have, to the Service of thoſe Idols. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) That a poor and mean Condition, is the Lot of many, nay perhaps of the moſt in this World. (3.) That a Man may be poor and miſerable in this World, and yet be very dear to God; the Grace of Sanctification is ſometimes beſtowed moſt eminently, where the Gifts of Providence have been diſpenſed more ſparingly.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And it came to paſs that the Beggar dyed, and was carried by the Angels into Abrahams Boſom; the rich man alſo dyed and was buried. 23 And in Hell lift up his eyes, being in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> here, (1.) That our Saviour repreſents all Men, both Good and bad, paſſing immediately out of this Life, into a State of Happineſs or Miſery; <hi>Lazarus dyed, and was carried by Angels into Abraham's boſom.</hi> Thence <hi>Note,</hi> That all Holy Souls, and amongſt the reſt the Godly Poor, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, after Death, conveyed by Angels to their place of Reſt and Bleſſedneſs. <hi>The Rich Man alſo dyed;</hi> this is added to let us know, that Riches for all Mens Confidence in them, will not deliver from Death; the rich Man might be Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by faring deliciouſly every day, whilſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed. <hi>And was Buried;</hi> Here is no mention of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Buryal, probably he had none, but flung out of the way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Hole or Pit; or if he had a Buryal, a very mean one, which is paſt over in ſilence: All the advantage which a rich Man has by a great Eſtate after he is Dead, is only to have a pompous Funeral, which yet ſignifies nothing to him, becauſe he is not ſenſible of it: <hi>And in Hell lifts up his Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. he feels at once his own Miſery, and ſenſibly perceives <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Happineſs. Thence <hi>Note,</hi> That the Souls of wicked Men, whilſt their Bodies lye in the Grave, are in a State of greateſt Miſery, which is aggravated, by the ſenſe they have at the ſame time of the Saints Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And he cryed and ſaid, Father Abraham have mercy on me, and ſend Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his Finger in Water and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) The place where the rich Man Suffers, it is in Hell; the Souls of wicked Men, when they leave their Bodies, do certainly go into a place of Torment, which is not only beyond Expreſſion, but our Apprehenſion alſo; Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the Heart of Man, to conceive thoſe dreadful things which God has prepared for them that hate him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The ſin for which he Suffers, it is the Sin of unmercifulneſs. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That uncharitableneſs and unmercifulneſs to the Poor, is a very great ſin, and ſuch a ſin as alone, and without any other Guilt, is ſufficient to Ruine a Man for ever; there is found in this ſin, great Impiety towards God, and great Inhumanity towards our own Nature. <hi>Obſ.</hi> (3.) The Nature and Quality of his Sufferings, they are exquiſitely painful, and void of the leaſt degrees of Comfort; not a drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is granted to cool an inflamed Tongue. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the leaſt Refreſhments are impatiently deſired by dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souls in Hell, but righteouſly denied and withheld from them; a drop of Water was deſired, but not granted.</p>
               <p n="25">25 But Abraham ſaid, Son, Remember, that thou in thy Life time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Title given to the rich Man by Father <hi>Abraham, Son;</hi> He doth not revile him, tho' a very bad Man; if we revile the Good we are unjuſt, they deſerve it not; if we revile the Bad, we are unwiſe, we ſhall get nothing by it; a wiſe Man knows not what it is to give bad Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Admonition given, <hi>Remember, that thou in thy Life-time receivedſt thy good things;</hi> thy good things in which thou placedſt all thy Happineſs; thy good things, which thou lookedſt upon thy ſelf as the Proprietor, and not as the Diſpenſer of; Now remember what thou hadſt, and what thou abuſedſt. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That the outward Bleſſings which are afforded to wicked Men on Earth, will be ſadly remembred in Hell; <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things.</hi> (2.) That no Man ought to meaſure his Happineſs hereafter by his Temporal Felicity here; we may receive our good things here, and yet be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented hereafter. (3.) That no Man ought to be exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled if he meets with Hardſhip here, becauſe thoſe for whom God deſigns good things hereafter, may have their evil things here; <hi>Son, Thou hadſt thy good things, and alſo La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus evil things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 And beſides all this, between us and you there is a great gulph fixed, ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you cannot, neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</p>
               <p>The meaning is, That there neither is, nor can be any Commerce or intercourſe betwixt glorified Saints and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sinners; but the State of Souls at Death is unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fixt and ſtated. <hi>Learn,</hi> that the miſerable Condition of damn'd Souls in the next World, and the bleſſed Condition of glorified Souls, is unchangeably and unalterably ſuch; the power of God is irreſiſtible, and the will of God is invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Oath of God is immutable; <hi>I have ſworn that they ſhall never enter into my reſt.</hi>

               <p>Here the rich Man is repreſented as retaining even in Hell ſome tenderneſs for his Relations on Earth; yet others think, that the kindneſs intended, was rather to himſelf than to his Relations; fearing that their ſinning by his Example ſhould be an aggravation of his own Torments. <hi>Note</hi> thence, That the preſence of ſinful Relations and companions in Hell, may be ſuppoſed to make a conſiderable Addition to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Damned; the ſight of thoſe whom they have ſinned with, is a freſh revival of their own Guilt; all the Circumſtances of their paſt and profligate Lives, are upon this occaſion continually in their remembrance.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</p>
               <p>That is, they have the inſpired Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, which ſufficiently declare the Mind and Will of God to Mankind, and therefore it is unreaſonable to expect any farther Revelation. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That a ſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God, is Evidence ſufficient for Divine things; it is a more certain way of Conveyance, and more ſecure from Impoſture: Secondly, That there is ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, or the Writings of the Holy Scriptures are of Divine Authority, and therefore to be read and heard, to be believed and aſſented to; <hi>They have Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="30">30 And he ſaid, nay, father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they would repent.</p>
               <p>As if he had ſaid, they have always had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets in their hands, but yet their Hearts remain impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; but if a ſpecial Meſſenger be ſent to them from the Dead, this will not fail to awaken them, and bring them to Repentance. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, how prone we are to diſlike God's Method and Means, which he has appointed for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming us from our Sins, and imagin ſome Methods of our
<pb facs="tcp:46556:110"/> own would be more Succeſsful. The Scriptures read, the Word Preached, the Sacraments Adminiſtred; theſe are the ordinary Means which the Wiſdom of God has appointed for Mens Conviction; and if we think a Meſſenger from the Dead would be a more conducible Means, the next Verſe will confute us, and thoroughly ſatisfy us, that whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures convince not, probably nothing will; for thus it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <p n="31">31 If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, tho' one aroſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>A very awakening Text this is, which ſpeaks dreadfully to Perſons ſitting all their days under the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and yet find not their Underſtandings enlightned, their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments convinced, their Wills ſubdued, and their Lives Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by it. Were it poſſible for ſuch Perſons to ſee one come from the Dead, yea from the Damned, with the flames of Hell about his Ears, wringing his Hands and gnaſhing his Teeth, bewailing his Miſery, and beſeeching them to take warning by his Example, and in time to acquaint themſelves with God, and be at Peace; all this would have no farther ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon them, than to move their Paſſion a little for the preſent, whilſt the dreadful found is in their Ears; the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and not his Providences, are the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and appointed means for Mens Converſion and Salvation. <hi>Note</hi> then, (1.) That no Viſions or Apparitions, no new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations concerning Eternal Rewards and Puniſhments, are to be expected from the other World, in order to Mens Converſion and Salvation. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) That the Word of God diſpenſed to us, and the ordinary Means of Grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by us, are a more conducible and effectual means to perſwade Men to Repentance, than if one ſhould ariſe from the Dead and Preach unto them. A Meſſenger from the Dead cannot bring with him either a more neceſſary Doctrine, or a more certain and infallible Doctrine, nor bring with him better Arguments for our Conviction, then what the Scriptures do propound to our Conſideration; nor can we expect a greater Co-operation of the Holy Spirit, or a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Concurrence of Divine Power to render a Meſſage from the Dead more effectual, then doth ordinarily attend the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word. Hence forward then, let us not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if when a Drunkard drops down dead upon the ſpot, the Companions ſay to one another, drink on: If Sinners dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tumble one another into the Grave, without conſidering the Operation of God's Hand; this to thoſe that conſider this Text, will not ſeem ſtrange; <hi>For if they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be converted,</hi> tho' hundreds of Sinners before their Eyes drop down dead; nay, <hi>if they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded tho' one aroſe from the Dead.</hi>

               <p>Two things are here <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) The Neceſſity of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Offences, <hi>It muſt needs be that offences come,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Mens Corruption, Satan's Malice, God's Permiſſion and juſt Judgment. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.)

From the whole <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That Scandals or Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Actions in the Church of Chriſt, will certainly happen, and frequently fall out amongſt thoſe that profeſs Religion and the Name of Chriſt; <hi>It is impoſſible but that Offences will come.</hi> Secondly, That Scandalous and offenſive Actions from ſuch as profeſs Religion, and the Name of Chriſt, are Bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Fatal Stumbling-blocks to wicked and worldly Men. Thirdly, That the Offence which wicked Men take at the Falls of the Profeſſors of Religion, to the hardning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their wicked and ſinful Practices, is matter of juſt and great Lamentation; <hi>Wo unto the World becauſe of Offences, Matt.</hi> 18.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Take heed to your ſelves, if thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him, and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent forgive him. 4 And if he treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee Seven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day, and turn again to thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of Forgiving an offending Brother, is preſt upon us with many forceable Arguments in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſpeak it to be a Duty of indiſpenſable Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This place is to be underſtood of private Offences, and perſonal Wrongs and Injuries done by one Man to another, which we muſt firſt reprove, and then remit; and altho' it be ſaid, <hi>If he repent, forgive him;</hi> that is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if we needed not pardon our Brother if he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to repent and ask Forgiveneſs; but whether he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges his offence or no to us, our Hearts muſt ſtand ready to forgive the Wrong done to us, and to pray for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs on his behalf, at the hands of God; laying aſide all thoughts and deſire of Revenge in our own Cauſe; and ſtanding ready to do any Office of Love and Service for our offending Brother. <hi>Learn</hi> hence (1.) That to fall often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Offence againſt our Brother, is a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Offence; <hi>If thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day;</hi> that is, very often. (2.) That as the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Offences is a great aggravation of Offences, ſo the Multiplying of Forgiveneſs, is a great Demonſtration of a God-like Temper in us; he that Multiplies ſin, doth like Satan, ſin abundantly; and he that multiplies Pardon, doth like God, pardon abundantly.</p>

The occaſion of this Supplication, <hi>our Saviour urging the Duty of forgiving Injuries. Learn</hi> (1.) That all Graces in general, ſo the Grace of Faith in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is weak and imperfect in the beſt of Saints. (2.) That the moſt eminent Saints, (Apoſtles not excepted) are very ſenſible of the imperfection of their Faith, and very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with God, daily for the encreaſe of it, <hi>Lord, encreaſe our Faith.</hi> (3.) That Faith ſtrengthned enables the Soul to the moſt difficult Duties of Obedience, and particularly helps to the practice of that hard Duty of Forgiving Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: When our Saviour had preach'd the Doctrine and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Forgiveneſs, the Apoſtles inſtantly pray, <hi>Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Faith.</hi>

               <p>Here our Saviour tells his Diſciples, that if they have the ſmalleſt degrees of true Faith, lively, operative Faith, it will enable them to perform this difficult Duty of Forgiving Injuries, and all other Duties, with as much facility and eaſe, as a miraculous Faith would enable them to remove Mountains, and tranſplant Trees. <hi>Learn,</hi> That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may tend to the Glory of God, or to our own Good and Comfort, but may be obtained of God by a firm exerciſe of Faith in him; <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi>

               <p n="7">7 But which of you having a Servant plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or feeding Cattel, will ſay unto him, by and by, when he is come from the field, Go, and ſit down to meat? 8 And will not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay unto him? make ready wherewith I may ſup, and gird thy ſelf, and ſerve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou

I trow not. 10 So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all thoſe things which are commanded you, ſay, We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants, we have done that which was our Duty to do.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of this Parable is to ſhew, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God neither is nor can be a Debtor to any of his Creatures, for the beſt Services which they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto him; and that they are ſo far from meriting a Reward of Juſtice, that they do not deſerve a return of thanks; three Arguments our Saviour makes uſe of, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and prove this; (1.) In reſpect of God, who is our abſolute Lord and Maſter; and the Argument lies thus, if Earthly Maſters do not owe ſo much as thanks to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for doing that which is commanded them, how much leſs can God owe the Reward of Eternal Life to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when they are never able to do all that is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, in a perfect and ſinleſs manner? (2.) In reſpect of our ſelves, who are his Bond-ſervants, his Ranſomed Slaves, and conſequently we are not our own Men, but his who hath redeemed us; and accordingly do owe him all that Service, yea more then all that we are able to perform unto him; and therefore whatever Reward is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed or given, it is wholly to be aſcribed to the Maſter's Bounty, and not to the Servants Merit. (3.) To Merit any thing by our good Works is impoſſible, in regard of the Works themſelves, becauſe all that we can do, altho' we did do all that is Commanded us, is but our Duty. The Argument runs thus; to bounden Duty belongs no Reward of Juſtice; but all the Service we do perform, yea more than we can perform to God, is Bounden Duty, therefore there is due unto us no reward of Juſtice, but of free Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. From the whole <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That we are wholly the Lord's, both by a right of Creation, and Redemption alſo. (2.) That as his we are, ſo him we ought to ſerve, by doing all thoſe things which he hath Commanded us. (3.) That when we have done all, we are to look for our Reward, not of Debt, but of Grace. (4.)

In Complyance with the Ceremonial Law, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Leper to be brought to them, to judge whether heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not; and if ſo, to receive the Offering preſcribed, in Token of Thankfulneſs. (2.) For the Tryal of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; had they ſtood upon Terms with Chriſt, and ſaid, alas, to what purpoſe is it to ſhew our ſelves to the Prieſts? what good can their Eyes do us? we ſhould be glad to ſee our ſelves Cured; but why ſhould we go to them to ſee our ſelves loathed? Had they thus expoſtulated, they had not been healed; what Command ſoever we receive from Chriſt, we muſt rather conſider the Authority of the Commander, than the weight of the thing Commanded; for God delights to try our Obedience by ſmall Precepts; happy for theſe Lepers, that in obedience to Chriſt went to the Prieſts, for <hi>as they went, they were healed.</hi>

How ſingly he returns his Thanks, he gets away from his Fellows to make his Acknowledgments; there are Caſes wherein Singularity is not only Lawful, but Laudable; inſtead of Subjecting our ſelves to others Examples, it is ſometimes our Duty to reſolve to ſet an Example to others; for it is much better to go the right way alone, then to err with Company. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.)

               <p>The Generality of the Jews, and particularly the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, expected that the promiſed Meſſias ſhould be a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prince, and deliver them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, under which they groaned.

From this Coming of Chriſt to judge <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was an Emblem of the final Judgment, we may gather this Inſtruction, that the Coming and Appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to the judging of wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners, it will be a very certain, ſudden, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Appearance.</p>
               <p n="26">26 And as it was in the days of Noe, ſo ſhall it be alſo in the days of the Son of Man. 27 They did eat, they drank, they married Wives, they were given in Marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the Ark, and the flood came and deſtroyed them all. 28 Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded. 29 But the ſame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them all. 30 Even thus ſhall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes our Saviour declares that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the World's final Deſolation at the great Day, would be like the Deſtruction of the old World in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and like the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> in the Days of <hi>Lott,</hi> and that both in regard of unexpectedneſs, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Senſuality and Security; as they before the Flood were eating and drinking, Marrying and giving in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; that is, wholly given up to Senſuality and Debauchery; and did not know, that is, did not conſider the Flood's coming, till it ſwept them away; thus was it before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thus will it be before the end of the World.

               <p>Here our Saviour adviſes them, that when they ſhall ſee the Judgments of God breaking out upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they make all poſſible ſpeed to get out of it, as <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family did out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and to take heed of imitating <hi>Lott</hi>'s Wife, who looking back became a pillar of Salt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Her Offence, ſhe looked back. (2.) The puniſhment of her Offence, <hi>She became a pillar of Salt;</hi> her Offence in looking behind her was manifeſt Diſobedience to the Divine Command, which ſaid, <hi>Look not behind thee;</hi> and proceeded either from Careleſneſs, or from Covetouſneſs, or from Curioſity, or from Compaſſion to thoſe ſhe left behind her, and was undoubtedly the effect of great Infidelity, ſhe not believing the Truth of what the Angel had declared as touching the Certainty and Suddenneſs of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Puniſhment of her Offence was Exemplary, <hi>She became a pillar of Salt;</hi> that is, a perpetual Monument of Divine Severity for her Infidelity and Diſobedience. Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The ſuddenneſs of her Puniſhment; the Juſtice of God Surprizes her in the very Act of Sin, with a preſent Revenge. (2.) The ſeeming diſproportion betwixt the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and the Offence; her Offence was a forbidden Look. From whence Carnal Reaſon might plead, was it not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for her to looſe her Eyes, but muſt ſhe looſe her Life? but the Eaſineſs and Reaſonableneſs of the Command aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated her Diſobedience; and tho' her Puniſhment may ſeem ſevere, it was not unjuſt. Now ſays our Saviour, <hi>Remember Lotts Wife;</hi> that is, let her Example caution all of you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Unbelief, Diſobedience, Worldly Mindedneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God's Threatnings, and Lingring after the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Society of lewd and wicked Perſons.</p>

That the ſureſt way to attain Eternal Life, is chearfully to lay down our Temporal Life, when the Glory of Chriſt, and the Honour of Religion requires it of us. Chriſt farther adds, that in this Terrible Night of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Calamity, when Deſtruction comes upon her, the Providence of God will remarkably diſtinguiſh between one Perſon and another: True Believers, and conſtant Profeſſors ſhall be delivered, and none elſe; ſuch ſhall eſcape the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, others ſhall fall by it.</p>

               <p n="1">1 AND he ſpake a Parable unto them, to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint. 2 Saying, There was in a City a Judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man. 3 And there was a widow in that City, and ſhe came unto him, ſaying, Avenge me of mine Adverſary. 4 And he would not for a while: But afterward he ſaid within himſelf, Tho I fear not God, nor regard man. 5 Yet becauſe this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, leſt by her continual coming ſhe weary me. 6 And the Lord ſaid, Hear what the unjuſt Judge ſaith. 7 And ſhall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night unto him, tho' he bear long with them? 8 I tell you, he will avenge them ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>There is no Duty in Chriſtianity, the practice of which our Saviour preſſes upon us more frequently than this Duty of Prayer. To encourage his Diſciples (and us in them) to fervency, importunity, and perſeverance in this Duty, he propounds here the Parable of an unjuſt Judge, who was overcome by an importunate Widow, to do her Juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Inclinations; from whence our Saviour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that if Importunity will prevail with a ſinful Man, to grant Petitions offered to him; how much more prevalent will ſuch Importunity be with the infinitely good God, to relieve the Neceſſities of ſuch as devoutly implore his help? And the force of the Argument lies thus; the Judge in the Parable, was an inferiour and ſubordinate Judge, was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and unjuſt Judge, was a mercileſs and hard hearted Judge, and yet upon her importunity, he avenged her; how much more will the Sovereign and Supreme Judge, the Holy and Righteous Judge, the Merciful and Compaſſionate Judge of all the Earth, hear and help his Praying People, and be the juſt Avenger of thoſe that fear him? From the whole <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That Prayer, or Liberty of making our Requeſts known to God is an ineſtimable Favour and Priviledge; he that conſiders the Nature of GOD, and the Nature of Man, cannot queſtion it; God is a Being of infinite Fulneſs and Perfection; a Self-ſufficient, and an All-ſufficient Good; and man an indigent, helpleſs dependent Creature; full of Wants, and obnoxious to Dangers. (2.) That Prayer is not only an ineſtimable Priviledge, but an indiſpenſable Duty. So ſollicitous is God for our Welfare and Happineſs, that he makes our Priviledge our Duty, by the Authority of his Command; ſo that we are at once ungrateful to God, and unjuſt to our ſelves, in the moſt exalted Degree, if we do not pray unto him, and ſpread our Wants before him. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (3.) That this Duty of Prayer is not an Occaſional, but a conſtant Duty; <hi>Men ought always to pray,</hi> that is, (1.) at all ſeaſonable times and fit opportunities; we are ſaid to do a thing continually, when we do it Seaſonably; now the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for Prayer are Morning and Evening. As the Morning and Evening Sacrifice was conſtant among the Jews, and the Fire was always upon the Altar and never went out; ſo he that prays Morning and Evening, may be ſaid to be <hi>inſtant in prayer,</hi> and <hi>to pray without ceaſing.</hi> (2.) Always to pray, is an endeavour always to keep the Heart in a praying Frame, and to be very frequent in offering up pious Ejaculations, and ſhort mental Prayers to God, as occaſion ſhall offer; when in the Field, in the Shop, in the Bed, when Sleep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, in the Journey when alone, this may be done advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly without loſs of Time, and Acceptably without danger of Hypocriſy, which too often mingles it ſelf with our more ſet Prayers. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) We muſt not only pray conſtantly, but pray fervently, yea importunately, if we would pray ſucceſsfully; we muſt cry to God, as the Widow to the Judge; vehemency and importunity, are both helps and ornaments to Prayer, they both Fortify and Beautify our Prayers, they pierce the Heavens, and offer an Holy Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to God: <hi>Oratio vincit invincibilem &amp; ligat Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem haec Deo Grata eſt,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian,</hi> God delights in ſuch Importunity.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Nevertheleſs when the Son of Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhall he find Faith on the Earth?</p>
               <p>If by the Son of Man's Coming, we underſtand Chriſt's Coming in Judgment againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then the ſenſe is this; That when he comes to take Vengeance on the obſtinate Jews, and to deſtroy their City, he ſhall find but little Faith, and patient waiting for help from God in the Land of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and conſequently little Importuning him with inceſſant Cries and Supplications, as this poor widow did the unjuſt Judge. Secondly, if by the Son of Man's Coming, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Chriſt's Coming to Judge the World at the Laſt Day, then the ſenſe is, when he Cometh he will find but few Faithful ones, comparatively ſpeaking; he will find but few ſincere and ſerious Chriſtians, in whom the genuine effects and fruits of Faith are found. <hi>Learn,</hi> That when Chriſt ſhall come to Judgment, he will find comparatively very few whoſe Hearts have not fainted, and very many, who thro' the power that Temptation has upon the Frailty of humane Nature, are fallen away; <hi>When the Son of Man cometh, will he find Faith on the Earth?</hi> verily but little Faith, and few Faithful ones.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And he ſpake this Parable unto certain which truſted in themſelves, that they were Righteous, and deſpiſed others. 10 Two men went up into the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee, the other a Publican. 11 The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publican. 12 I faſt twice in the
<pb facs="tcp:46556:112"/> week, I give Alms of all that I poſſeſs. 13 And the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes unto Heaven, but ſmote upon his Breaſt, ſaying, God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a ſinner. 14 I tell you, this man went down to his houſe juſtified, rather then the other; for every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</p>
               <p>The Deſign and Scope of our Saviour in this Parable is to reprove and condemn the Phariſees, and in them all other Self-Juſticiaries, who having an high Opinion of, and truſting in their own Righteouſneſs, deſpiſed others as vile Perſons, whoſe Religion is not accompanied with Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who pretend not to ſuch extraordinary degrees of Sanctity as themſelves. And the Parable further ſhews, That an humble, Self-Condemned Sinner, who tho' he has been wicked, is now ſenſible of it, and with ſhame and ſorrow confeſſes it before God, ſhall be ſooner pardoned, and find Favour with God, than he that vaunts of his Vertue, and reſts in the outward Duties of Religion; his pride and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of himſelf ſhall abaſe him, while the others Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhall exalt him. This is the general Scope of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the particular Obſervations from it are theſe, (1.) The Phariſee and the Publican both Pray, they both pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they both pray together in the place of Prayer, the Holy Temple, and they both Pray, <hi>Apud ſe,</hi> with and within themſelves; where the Duty and Action is the ſame, there may be vaſt difference in the purpoſe and intention; doth an humble Saint pray? ſo may an haughty Hypocrite; <hi>Two men went up into the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Publican. Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Phariſees Prayer, <hi>He ſtood and prayed with himſelf, God I thank,</hi> &amp;c. Where <hi>Note,</hi> his Geſture, <hi>He ſtood and prayed;</hi> ſtanding and kneeling are Praying Geſtures, but ſitting is a rude Indecency, except in Caſes of Neceſſity; <hi>In Prayer,</hi> ſays pious Biſhop <hi>Hall, I will either ſtand as a Servant to my Maſter, or Kneel as a Subject to my Prince. Note</hi> farther, It is ſaid, <hi>he prayed,</hi> but here is not one Petition, but Thankſgiving; <hi>God I thank thee,</hi> &amp;c. Whence <hi>Learn,</hi> That Thankſgiving is a part of Prayer; <hi>Hannah</hi>'s Prayer, as it is called 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. is a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or Song of Praiſe; we then Pray beſt when we praiſe God moſt. <hi>Again,</hi> See the Phariſees Pride in this his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; This proud Begger ſhews not his Wounds but his worth, not his Rags but his Robes, not his Miſery, but his Bravery; yea he brings God Almighty in a Reckoning of his Services; <hi>I faſt twice a Week, I give Alms of all that I poſſeſs,</hi> and thanks God more that others were bad, than that himſelf was good; had the Phariſee with an humble Mind thanked God for his reſtraining Grace, that tho' he were not ſo good as he ſhould be, that yet he was not ſo vile and bad as ſome others, this had been no fault, but when he comes before God with a proud and ſcornful Mind, inwardly pleaſed, that others were ſo bad, and ſo much worſe than himſelf; giving Thanks rather for others Badneſs, than his own Goodneſs; This is a wickedneſs incident to none but Divelliſh Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That whatever ſhews of Goodneſs an Hypocrite may make, yet he is inwardly glad, and takes a ſecret Delight in others Badneſs; <hi>God I thank thee that I am not as this Publican;</hi> which was a kind of Triumph, and proud inſultation over the poor Publican; he would ſeem to thank God that he was not ſo bad as the Publican, when indeed he was glad that the Publican was not ſo good as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Publicans Behaviour, in an humble ſight and ſenſe of his own ſinfulneſs and unworthineſs. <hi>He ſtood afar off,</hi> probably in the Court of the Gentiles, where all ſorts of Sinners might come; acknowledging thereby, that he was unworthy to come near the Holy Majeſty of God; not preſuming <hi>to lift up his eyes to Heaven,</hi> That place of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs and Purity; but like a true ſelf-condemned Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, ſmote upon his Breaſt, and in bitter Remorſe of Soul ſaid, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That a truly humble temper of mind, well becomes us in all our Approaches and Addreſſes to God, and is more acceptable to him than all pompous Performances whatſoever. For <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly; The Publican being thus condemned of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf departs Juſtified by God; <hi>He went down to his houſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, rather than the Phariſee;</hi> the Phariſee juſtified himſelf, the Publican was juſtified by God. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That a Penitent Sinner, who is indeed poor in Spirit, is far more eſteemed of God, than he that makes long Prayers, faſts often, Tythes all his Subſtance, and prides himſelf in all this. Without Humility, all is vain Glory and Hypocriſy; and the Seemingly moſt Sanctified Perſon that has it not, is like a painted Sepulchre, Beautiful without, but full of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs within.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And they brought unto him Infants, that he would touch them; but when his Diſciples ſaw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jeſus called them unto him and ſaid, Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God. 17 Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, ſhall in no wiſe enter therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) A ſolemn Action performed; Children, Infants, ſucking Children, as the word ſignifies, are brought to Chriſt that he might bleſs them, the Parents looking up-Chriſt as a Prophet, as a great and extraordinary Prophet, perſwaded themſelves, that by his Prayers, and laying his Hands on their Children, they ſhould be preſerved from Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diſeaſes, and from Satan's Power, and that he would confer upon them all needful Bleſſings. <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That Infants are capable of Benefit by Jeſus Chrſt. (2.) That it is the beſt Office that Parents can perform unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to bring them unto Chriſt, that they may be made partakers of that Benefit. (3.) That if Infants are capable of Benefit by Chriſt, if capable of his Bleſſing on Earth, and Preſence in Heaven; if they be Subjects of his Kingdom of Grace, and Heirs of his Kingdom of Glory, then may they be Baptized; for they that are within the Covenant, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.) have a Right to the Priviledges of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to Baptiſm the Seal of the Covenant: And if Chriſt denies not Infants the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the greater, What Reaſon have his Miniſters to deny them the Benefit of Baptiſm, which is the leſs. <hi>Learn</hi> (4.) That Chriſt will have all his Diſciples and Followers to reſemble little Children in ſuch Properties wherein they may be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns to them, <hi>viz.</hi> in Humility and Innocency, in freedom from Malice and Revenge, in Docibility and Teachableneſs, in Cleaving to, and Depending upon their Parents, and in Contentedneſs with their Condition; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, ſhall in no wiſe enter therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. And a certain Ruler asked him, ſaying, Good Maſter, What ſhall I do to inherit Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life?</p>
               <p>We have here a conſiderable Perſon, a Ruler, coming to Chriſt, with an important queſtion in his Mouth, <hi>What muſt I do to inherit eternal Life?</hi> Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) He believes the certainty of future State. (2.) He profeſſes a deſire of an Eternal Happineſs in that State. (3.) He declares his readineſs and willingneſs to do ſome good thing in order to the obtaining of that Happineſs. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That the Light of Nature, or Natural Religion, teaches Men that good Works are neceſſary to Salvation; or that ſome good thing muſt be done by them, who at Death expect Eternal Life; it is not Talking well, and Profeſſing well, but Living well, that Entitles us to Heaven, and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Why cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou me Good? None is good, ſave one, that is God.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here reproves this Perſon for calling him <hi>Good,</hi> when he did not own to be God; ſaying, <hi>There is none good,</hi> that is, Eſſentially and Originally Good, abſolutely and immutably Good, <hi>but God</hi> only; nor any derivatively Good, but he that receives his Goodneſs from God alſo.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Thou knoweſt the Commandments, Do not commit Adultery, Do not Kill, Do not Steal,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:112"/> Do not bear falſe Witneſs, Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> here, that the Duties Directed to by our Saviour, are the Duties of the Second Table, nothing being a better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of our unfeigned Love to God, than a ſincere Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duty to our Neighbour; Love to Man is a Fruit and Teſtimony of our Love to God. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That ſuch as are defective in the Duties of the Second Table, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Juſtice towards Man, do make but a Counterfeit ſhew of Religion, tho' they pretend to the higheſt Degrees of Love to God.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And he ſaid, all theſe things have I kept from my Youth up.</p>
               <p>This Aſſertion might be very true according to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſenſe and interpretation of the Law, which Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the groſs outward Act, not the inward Luſts and Motions of the Heart. An external Obedience to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law this Man might poſſibly have performed; this made him think well of himſelf, and conclude the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Condition. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, How prone Men are to think the beſt of themſelves, and to have too high an Opinion of their own Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs before God; this is very natural, but dangerous and fatal.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Now when Jeſus heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Yet lackeſt thou one thing, Sell all that thou haſt, and diſtribute unto the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven, and come and follow me.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Our Lord's Admonition, <hi>Yet lackeſt thou one thing,</hi> which was true Self-denial, in renouncing the Sin of Covetouſneſs, and the inordinate Love of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wealth: We ought in the midſt of our abundance, to maintain a readineſs of Diſpoſition, to part with all for God's ſake, that is dear unto us in this World. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) Our Lord's Injunction, <hi>Sell all that thou haſt, and give to the poor.</hi> This was not a Common, but a ſpecial Precept, given par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to this Rich Man for Tryal, like that given to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 22. and to convince him of his corrupt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Riches; yet is the Precept thus far of general uſe to us all, to teach us ſo to contemn Worldly Poſſeſſions, as to be willing to part with them all at God's Pleaſure, and when they prejudice our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And when he heard this, he was ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for he was very rich.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Note</hi> the Effect which our Saviour's Admonition had upon this Perſon, <hi>He was ſorrowful. Learn</hi> thence, That Carnal Men are exceeding ſorrowful when they cannot win Heaven in their own way. (2.) That ſuch as are wedded to the World, will renounce Chriſt rather than the World, when the World and Chriſt ſtand in Competition, <hi>he went away ſorrowful,</hi> (St. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.22.) <hi>for he was very rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 And when Jeſus ſaw he was very ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he ſaid, How hardly ſhall they that have Riches enter into the Kingdom of God? 25 For it is eaſier for a Camel to go thorough a Needle's eye, then for a rich Man to enter into the kingdom of God. 26 And they that heard it, ſaid, Who then can be ſaved? 27 And he ſaid, the things which are impoſſible with men, are poſſible with God.</p>
               <p>Our Holy Lord takes occaſion from the rich Man's Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from him, to diſcourſe concerning the danger of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Difficulties that attend Rich Men in their way to Heaven. From whence we may collect and gather (1.) That Rich Men do certainly meet with more Difficulties in their way to Heaven, then other Men; 'tis difficult to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Affections from Riches, to place their ſupreme Love upon God in the midſt of their Riches, and to depend entirely upon God in a rich Condition; <hi>For the rich mans wealth is his ſtrong Tower.</hi> (2.) That yet the fault lies not in Riches, but in rich Men, who by placing their Truſt, and repoſing their Confidence in Riches, do render their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on difficult, if not impoſſible. (3.) Our Saviour's prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial Speech, of <hi>a Camels going thorough the eye of a Needle,</hi> implies thus much, That it is not only a great Difficulty, but an utter impoſſibility, for ſuch as abound in Worldly Wealth, and place their Confidence therein, to be Saved, without an extraordinary Grace and Aſſiſtance from God. 'Tis hard for God to make a Rich Man Happy, becauſe he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Happy without God. (4.) That as difficult and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this may ſeem to Men, yet nothing is impoſſible with GOD; he can change the Heart of the Rich, by the rich and powerful Influences of his Holy Spirit, <hi>That which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with Men, is poſſible with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28 Then Peter ſaid, Lo, we have left all and followed thee.</p>
               <p>It was well done, and wiſely done of <hi>Peter,</hi> to leave all and follow Chriſt, it was the beſt Bargain he ever made in all his Life. But <hi>Obſerve</hi> how he magnifies that little he had left for Chriſt, and uſhers it in with a Note of Admiration, <hi>Lo! we have left all and followed thee. Learn</hi> hence, That tho' it be very little that we Suffer for Chriſt, and have to forſake upon his Account, yet we are prone to magnify and admire it, as if it were ſome great matter. Lord ſays <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, We have left all;</hi> What all, Man, hadſt thou to leave? a few ragged Nets, and a Tatter'd Fiſherboat; a great All in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, next to nothing at all, ſcarce worth mentioning, and yet how is it magnified? <hi>Behold we have left all, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee.</hi>

               <p n="29">29 And he ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, There is no man that hath left houſe or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's ſake. 30 Who ſhall not receive manifold more in this preſent time, and in the world to come Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here the Lenity and Kindneſs of our Lord's Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anſwer, he tells his Diſciples, That they who had left all and followed him, ſhould be no loſers by him; that in this World they ſhould receive many fold. St. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. ſays, <hi>an hundred fold;</hi> but how ſo? <hi>Non formaliter, ſed emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter, non in ſpecie, ſed in valore, Not in Kind, but in Equivalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> not an hundred Brethren, and Siſters, and Poſſeſſions, in Kind, but he ſhall enjoy all that in God, which all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would be to him, if they were multiplied an hundred times. Oh the Sanctifying Gifts and Saving Graces, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Comforts, and raviſhing Conſolations of the Holy Spirit, are a ſufficient Compenſation for any thing, for all, yea for more than all that we can part with for the ſake of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Then he took unto him the Twelve, and ſaid unto them, behold we go up to Jeruſalem, and all things that are written by the Prophets concerning the Son of Man ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 32 For he ſhall be delivered unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and ſhall be mocked, and ſpitefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and ſpit upon. 33 And they ſhall Scourge him, and put him to Death, and the third day he ſhall riſe again. 34 And they underſtood none of theſe things, and this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was hid from them; neither knew they the things which were ſpoken</p>
               <p>We find our Bleſſed Saviour very frequently acquainting his Diſciples with his approaching Sufferings, to prevent the Offence that they might take at them, when the Providence of God brought them forth; his Deſign was to arm them with expectation of his Sufferings, and to quicken them to Preparation for their own; yet is it here ſaid, <hi>That the Diſciples underſtood none of theſe ſayings;</hi> Why ſo? were not the words eaſy enough to be underſtood? yes, but they could not reconcile them to the Notion of the Meſſiah, which they had drank in; they concluded he ſhould be a Temporal Prince, and ſubdue their Temporal Enemies, but could not conceive how he that ſhould redeem Iſrael, ſhould dye, and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:113"/> be thus barbarouſly uſed; we had great need to conſider well what Notions we have concerning the things of God, before we entertain them; for falſe Notions once taken up, are not without great difficulty laid down.</p>
               <p n="35">35 And it came to paſs, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man ſate by the way-ſide, begging. 36 And hearing the multitude paſs by, he asked what it meant? 37 And they told him, That Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth paſſeth by. 38 And he cryed, ſaying, Jeſus, thou Son of David have mercy on me. 39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he ſhould hold his peace; and he cryed ſo much the more, Thou Son of David have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me. 40 And Jeſus ſtood, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him. 41 Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What wilt thou that I ſhall do unto thee? and he ſaid, Lord, that I may receive my ſight. 42 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Receive thy ſight, thy Faith hath ſaved thee. 43 And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately he received his ſight, and followed him, glorifying God, and all the people when they ſaw it, gave praiſe unto God.</p>
               <p>This Chapter concludes with the recital of a famous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, wrought by our Saviour upon a Blind Man, whom St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls <hi>Bartimeus.</hi> Where we have <hi>Obſervable</hi> (1.) The Blind Man's Faith in Acknowledging Chriſt to be the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah; for ſo much the Title of <hi>Son of David</hi> did import. (2.) <hi>Obſerve</hi> his Fervency as well as his Faith, he cryed to Chriſt for the Mercy of Healing, <hi>Have mercy on me thou Son of David:</hi> A true ſenſe of Want, either Bodily or Spiritual, will cauſe a Soul to cry to Chriſt with earneſtneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The great Compaſſion and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of Chriſt towards this blind Man; <hi>he ſtood ſtill, he called him, and enlightned his Eyes.</hi> (4.) Before Chriſt would reſtore the blind Man to ſight, he muſt ſenſibly complain of the want of ſight, and cry unto him for it. Chriſt knows all his Creatures Wants, but takes no notice of them, till they make them known to him by Prayer. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) How much Chriſt magnifies Faith; what he attributes to it, and how he rewards the leaſt Exerciſe of it, <hi>Jeſus ſaid, thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi> Chriſt himſelf was the efficient Cauſe of the blind mans Healing; but he exerted this Divine Power upon the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the blind Mans Faith; and accordingly ſays, Thy Faith hath ſaved thee. (6.) <hi>Note</hi> in what way and manner the Blind Man doth expreſs his Thankfulneſs to Chriſt for his recovered Sight, <hi>he followed him, glorifying God:</hi> Mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt is then well Improved, when it engages us to follow Chriſt; this ſhould be the Effect of all Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wrought for us; he praiſeth God beſt, that ſerveth him moſt, the Life of Thankfulneſs conſiſts in the Thankfulneſs of the Life.</p>

               <p n="1">1 AND Jeſus entered and paſſed through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo. 2 And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, which was the chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Publicans, and he was rich.</p>
               <p>This Hiſtory which relates the Calling and Converſion of <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publican, is uſhered in with a Note of Wonder, <hi>Behold there was a man named Zacheus;</hi> It is both great and good News to hear of a Soul Converted unto God; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch a remarkable Sinner as <hi>Zacheus</hi> was; for (1.) he was by Profeſſion a Publican; a Calling that carried Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion in its Face, and bad defiance to his Converſion; yet behold from the Toll Booth is <hi>Zacheus</hi> called to be a Diſciple, and <hi>Matthew</hi> an Apoſtle; ſuch is the Freeneſs of Divine Grace, that it often calls the greateſt ſinners, and Triumphs in their powerful Converſion. (2.) He was a Chief Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and probably one of the chief of Sinners, yet behold him among the chief of Saints. Lord! What Penitent need deſpair of thy Mercy, when he ſees a Publican, nay the chief of Publicans gone to Heaven? (3.) It is added as a farther Circumſtance, <hi>That he was Rich;</hi> his Trade was not a greater obſtacle to his Converſion than his Wealth; not that there is any malignity in Riches conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they become a ſnare through the Corruption of our Natures. <hi>Zacheus</hi> had not been ſo famous a Convert, if he had not been Rich; if more Difficulty, yet was there more Glory in the Converſion of rich <hi>Zacheus.</hi> To all theſe might be added a fourth Circumſtance, namely, that <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was Converted in his old Age, after a long Habit of ſin contracted. Such inſtances, tho' few, has God left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Scripture, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Zacheus</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the New.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And he ran before, and ſought to ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who he was, and could not for the Preſs, becauſe he was little of ſtature. 4 And he climbed up into a Sycamore Tree to ſee him, for he was to paſs that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacheus</hi> deſired to ſee Jeſus, this was a ſight that few rich Men deſire to ſee; the ſight of <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Face upon their Coyn is more pleaſing to them, then to ſee the Face of Chriſt in his Ordinances; yet it was not Faith but Fancy and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that made <hi>Zacheus</hi> climb the Sycamore to ſee Jeſus; but the Curioſity of the Eye, gave occaſion for the belief of the Heart; he that deſires to ſee Jeſus is in the way to enjoy him, 'tis good to be near the place where Chriſt is, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Principle bring us thither.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And when Jeſus came to the place, he looked up and ſaw him, and ſaid unto him, Zacheus, make haſte and come down, for to day I muſt abide at thy Houſe, 6 And he made haſte and came down, and received him joyfully.</p>
               <p>What an inſtance is here of Chriſt's preventing Grace and Mercy; <hi>Zacheus</hi> climbs up into the Sycamore to ſee Jeſus, Jeſus firſt ſees him; little did <hi>Zacheus</hi> think, that Jeſus ſhould caſt up his Eyes to him; Chriſt's Looks are Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Looks, there went a Divine Power along with them, to change the Heart of him whom he look'd upon; he that could heal a Diſeaſe by the Hem of his Garment, could change an Heart with the glance of his Eye. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, Chriſt doth not only <hi>Note,</hi> but <hi>Name Zacheus; He bids him come down, for he muſt abide at his houſe;</hi> What a ſweet Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity was here, tho' the diſtance be infinitely great betwixt our Saviour and our ſelves, yet he treats us, not with a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Statelineſs, but with a gracious Affability. Some <hi>Note,</hi> That <hi>Zacheus</hi> was the firſt Man we read of to whoſe Houſe Chriſt invited himſelf. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, With what ſpeed <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> haſtens down, and with what Alacrity he entertains our Saviour; Curioſity carried him up, but Love brings him down, and he entertains Chriſt joyfully; but alas! it was but for a few Hours. Lord! How great is the Happineſs of that Man that Receives and Entertains thee, not for a Day or a Year, or for Millions of Years, but for Everlaſting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? Oh let us welcome thee into our Hearts by Faith, whilſt we are here on Earth, and then thou wilt make us welcome with thy ſelf Everlaſtingly in thy Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And when they ſaw it, they all murmured ſaying, That he was gone to be a Gueſt with a Man that is a ſinner.</p>
               <p>That is, the Phariſees who were there, were highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that Chriſt went to a Publican's Houſe, whom they look'd upon as the worſt of Men; their Eye was Evil, becauſe Chriſt's was good: Whither ſhould the Phyſician go, but to the Sick, the whole need him not.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And Zacheus ſtood and ſaid unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my Goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any Man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four-fold.</p>

As to his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The freeneſs of it; not <hi>I lend,</hi> but <hi>I give:</hi> (2.) The readineſs of it, not I will, but <hi>I do give.</hi> (3.) The juſtneſs and honeſty of it, <hi>my Goods,</hi> not my Spoyls; what is my own, and not rent from others by Rapine or Extortion. (4.) The largeneſs, and extenſiveneſs of this Charity, <hi>half of my Goods,</hi> not an inconſiderable pittance. (5.) The fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Charity, <hi>to the Poor;</hi> not to the rich, not to his rich Heirs, but to his poor Neighbours. Again, as his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was large, ſo his Reſtitution was juſt; as he gave half to the Poor, ſo he <hi>Reſtored fourfold to the wronged;</hi> What an evidence was here of a true Penitent, Confeſſion and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction are both found with him.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This day is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation come unto this houſe, foraſmuch as he alſo is the Son of Abraham.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Zacheus</hi> gave to the Poor, was nothing to what Chriſt gave to him: it was but droſs he gave to them, it was Salvation Chriſt gave to him: Where is the Man that can ſay God is in his Debt for Acts of Charity and Mercy? Where is he that will not own God the beſt and quickeſt Pay-maſter? <hi>This day is Salvation come to this houſe;</hi> 'tis thine in Title, and e're long it ſhall be thine in Poſſeſſion; <hi>Foraſmuch as he alſo is the Son of Abraham;</hi> that is, either a natural Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Jew, or a Spiritual Son a Believer; the Heir of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, which was alſo imputed to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Oh happy <hi>Zacheus!</hi> thou haſt climbed up from thy Sycamore to Heaven, and by thy Charity and Juſtice haſt purchaſed to thy ſelf a Kingdom that fadeth not away.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) A Deſcription of Man's deplorable State and undone Condition, he is <hi>Loſt.</hi> (2.) The Care of Chriſt to Seek and Recover Man out of that loſt State; <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt. Learn</hi> (1.) That Man's Condition is a Loſt Condition, and every unregenerate Man is a loſt Man; he has loſt his God, his Soul, his Happineſs, his Excellency, his Liberty, his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. (2.) That the great Errand that Chriſt came into the World upon, it was to ſeek and to ſave loſt Sinners; this he does by his Blood, by his Word, by his Spirit, and by his Rod.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And as they heard theſe things, he added and ſpake a Parable, becauſe he was nigh to Jeruſalem, and becauſe they thought the king. dom of God ſhould immediately appear. 12 He ſaid therefore, A certain Noble-man went into a far Country, to receive for himſelf a Kingdom, and to return. 13 And he called his Ten Servants, and delivered them Ten Pounds, and ſaid unto them occupy till I come. 14 But his Citizens hated him, and ſent a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger after him, ſaying, We will not have this Man to Reign over us. 15 And it came to paſs when he was returned, having received the Kingdom, that he commanded thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the Money, that he might know how much every man had gained by Trading. 16 Then came the firſt, ſaying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten Pounds. 17 And he ſaid unto him, Well, thou good Servant, Becauſe thou haſt been Faithful in a very little, have thou Authority over Ten Cities. 18 And the ſecond came, ſaying, Lord, Thy pound hath gained Five pounds. 19 And he ſaid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to him, Be thou alſo over Five Cities. 20 And another came, ſaying, Lord, Behold, here is thy pound which I have laid up in a Napkin. 21 For I feared thee, becauſe thou art an auſtere Man, thou takeſt up that thou laid'ſt not down, and reapeſt that thou didſt not ſow. 22 And he ſaith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked Servant; Thou kneweſt that I was an auſtere Man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not ſow. 23 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then gaveſt not thou my money into the Bank, that at my coming I might have received my own with Uſury. 24 And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that ſtood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath Ten pounds. 25 And they ſaid unto him, Lord, he hath Ten pounds. 26 For I ſay unto you, that unto every one which hath ſhall be given; and from him that hath not, even that which he hath ſhall be taken away. 27 But thoſe mine enemies, that would not that I ſhould Reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this Parable, we muſt (1.) Conſider the occaſion of it, (2.) The Deſign and Scope of it, (3.) The Leſſons of Inſtruction which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour intended us by it. As to the former; the occaſion of our Saviour's uttering this Parable, ſeems to be this, he was now going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to dye, ſome of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were of Opinion, that he would immediately enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Kingdom, and Act as a Temporal Prince, delivering them from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and deſtroying his and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; he lets them underſtand the quite contrary, that he muſt dye and riſe again, and aſcend into Heaven, and then return again and receive the Kingdom; and that he was now taking his laſt Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in order to that End. The Deſign, (2.) and Scope of the Parable, together with the Interpretation of it is thus, <hi>The Noble-man</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is our Saviour himſelf, who in his State of great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation was but like a Noble-man; <hi>His going into a far Country,</hi> ſignifieth his return from Earth to Heaven; <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again,</hi> ſignifieth his Coming to Judgment; <hi>his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Servants, and delivering them their Talents,</hi> intimates to us, the various Gifts which he beſtows upon the Sons of Men, all which are to be employed in his Service, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his Glory, <hi>his calling his Servants to an Account</hi> plainly ſignifies, that when Chriſt comes to Judgment, he will have an account of every Individual Perſon, how they have uſed the Gifts, and improved the Tallents entruſted with them; and that they may expect to be impartially Rewarded according to their Works, for God will appear a Righteous God, and will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Sinners out of their own Mouths, and a moſt certain and final Ruine will be their Portion, whilſt thoſe that were Faithful in his Service ſhall be crowned with his Rewards. Now from the whole we may <hi>Learn</hi> theſe Leſſons of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (1.) That our Lord's State of Humiliation and great Abaſement on Earth, being paſt and over, a glorious State of Exaltation he is now arrived at in Heaven; God has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him with great Triumph to his Kingdom in Heaven. (2.) That Cloathed with infinite Majeſty and Power, and attended with an innumerable Hoſt of Glorified Angels and Saints, this exalted Saviour will come to Judge Angels and Men. (3.) That in the mean time Chriſt variouſly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to his Servants particular Talents, to be employed and improved for his own Glory and his Churches good. (4.) That there will moſt certainly be a Reckoning-day, or a time when our Lord will take an Account of Mens improving thoſe Gifts and Graces which were given them as ſo many Talents to be improved by them. (5.) That there will be degrees of Happineſs and Miſery in the other World, according to Mens Degrees of Faithfulneſs or Negligence in this. (6.) That it is abominably Falſe and Impious to charge God, as being rigid and ſevere with Men, and requiring Impoſſibilities at their Hands, <hi>For out of their own Mouths will God condemn them. Laſtly,</hi> That the Condition of God's Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants will be unſpeakably Happy, and that of the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant intolerably Miſerable, both in this World, and in the next; the Righteous ſhall enter into the joy of their Lord, and be confirmed therein, with an utter impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:46556:114"/> of loſing that Happineſs. The Wicked who would not ſubmit to Chriſt's Authority, ſhall not be able to reſiſt his Power. They that would not ſuffer Chriſt to Reign over them, they ſhall at the laſt Day be brought forth and ſlain before him, <hi>Theſe mine Enemies that would not that I,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And when he had thus ſpoken, he went Before aſcending up to Jeruſalem. 29 And it came to paſs when he was come nigh to Bethpage and Bethany, at the Mount called the Mount of Olives, he ſent two of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. 30 Saying, Go ye into the Village over-againſt you, in the which at your entering ye ſhall find a Colt tyed, whereon yet never man ſate, looſe him, and bring him hither, 31 And if any man ask you why do you looſe him? thus ſhall ye ſay unto him, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath need of him. 32 And they that were ſent, went their way, and found even as he had ſaid unto them. 33 And as they were looſing the Colt, the Owners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſaid unto them, Why looſe ye the Colt? 34 And they ſaid, The Lord hath need of him. 35 And they brought him to Jeſus, and they caſt their Garments upon the Colt, and they ſet Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus thereon. 36 And as he went, they ſpread their Cloaths in the way. 37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the mount of Olives, the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Diſciples, began to rejoyce, and praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had ſeen. 38 Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord; peace in Heaven, and glory in the Higheſt. 39 And ſome of the Phariſees from among the Multitude, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Maſter, rebuke thy Diſciples. 40 And he anſwered and ſaid unto them, I tell you, That if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out.</p>
               <p>Our Lord, (as is Noted before) was now upon his laſt Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he was to ſhed his Blood, and lay down his Life, for the Redemption and Salvation of a loſt World; and it is Obſervable, what a double Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he gives of his great Willingneſs and Forwardneſs to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there to dye. (1.) Both St. <hi>Luke</hi> here, and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> Ch. 10.32. tells us, That <hi>he went before</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, leading the way, when he went to Suffer: Lord! With what Alacrity and holy Chearfulneſs didſt thou manage the great Work of Man's Redemption. None ever went ſo willingly to a Crown, as thou to thy Croſs. (2.) Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who all his Life Travelled like a poor Man on Foot, now he goes up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to dye for us, he will Ride, to ſhew his great Forwardneſs to lay down his Life for us; but what was the Beaſt he rode upon, an Aſſes Colt, to Fulfil that Prophecy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Tell ye the Daughter of Sion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your King cometh, riding upon an Aſs;</hi> yea, it was a Colt upon which never man rode before; to let us ſee, how the moſt unruly and untamed Creatures become obedient and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious to Chriſt, and render themſelves ſerviceable to him at his pleaſure. It was alſo a borrowed Aſs, taken without the Owners Leave, whereby our Saviour's Right to all the Creatures was manifeſted; and accordingly he bids his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples tell the Owner, <hi>That the Lord had need of him;</hi> not your Lord, or our Lord, but the Lord, that is, he that is Lord of the whole Earth, <hi>whoſe are the Cattel upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hills.</hi> Here <hi>Note,</hi> What a clear and full Demonſtration Chriſt gave of his Divine Nature; of his Omniſciency in fore-ſeeing and fore-telling the Event; of his Omnipotency in inclining the Heart, and over-ruling the will of the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to let the Colt go, and of his Sovereignty, that as he was Lord of the Creatures, he could command and call for their Service whenever he needed them. The Colt being brought, and our Saviour ſet thereon; <hi>Obſerve</hi> next, the Actions of the Multitude in Acknowledging Chriſt to be their King, they ſpread their Cloaths in the way, caſting their Garments on the Ground, for him to ride upon, according to the Cuſtom of Princes when they ride in State; yea the Multitude do not only Diſrobe their Backs, but expend their Breath in ioyful Acclamations, and loud Hoſannah's, wiſhing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Proſperity to their Meek but Mighty Prince. In this Princely, yet poor and deſpicable Pomp, doth our Saviour enter the famous City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Oh how far was our Holy Lord from affecting Worldly greatneſs and grandeur? he deſpiſed that Glory which Worldly Hearts fondly admire; yet becauſe he was a King, he would be proclaimed ſuch; and have his Kingdom, Confeſt, Applauded, and Bleſt; but that it might appear that his Kingdom was not of this World, he abandons all Worldly Magnificence; Oh Glorious, yet Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pomp! oh Meek but Mighty Prince! <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, The peeviſh Envy of the wicked Phariſees who were then in Company, they grudge our Saviour this poor Honour, they Envy him this ſmall Triumph of coming into the City up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Aſſes Colt, attended by a Company of poor People, ſtrewing the way with Boughs of Trees, with Hoſannah's and joyful Acclamations in their Mouths: Theſe poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Mouths they would have ſtopped; <hi>Maſter, rebuke thy Diſciples;</hi> they did not like the Muſick: Chriſt tells them, that they Labour in vain to ſuppreſs the Teſtimony given him by his Diſciples, for <hi>if they ſhould be ſilent, the ſtones would cry out,</hi> yea cry ſhame of them for neglecting their Duty; as if Chriſt had ſaid, the Speechleſs Stones will ſpeak, and give witneſs to me if Men will not. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, They that are owned of God, ſhall not want ownings and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings from Man at one time or other, in one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; tho' the Envy and Malice of Men do never ſo much gainſay and oppoſe it.</p>
               <p n="41">41 And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it.</p>
               <p>No ſooner did our Saviour come within the ſight and view of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he burſt out into Tears, at the conſideration of their Obſtinacy, and wilful rejecting of the Offers of Grace and Salvation made unto them; and alſo he wept to conſider the dreadful Judgments that hung over their Heads for thoſe Sins, even the utter Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their City and Temple. <hi>Learn</hi> hence (1.) That good Men ever have been, and are Men of tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Diſpoſitions, ſorrowing not only for their own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but others Calamities. (2.) That Chriſt ſhed Tears as well as Blood, for a loſt World, <hi>Chriſt wept over Jeruſalem,</hi> as well as bled for her. (3.) That Chriſt was infinitely more concerned for the Salvation of poor Sinners, than for his own Death and Sufferings, not the ſight of his own Croſs, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Calamities made him weep.</p>
               <p n="42">42 If thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things belonging to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
               <p>By <hi>the things belonging to their peace,</hi> we are to underſtand the preſence of Chriſt amongſt them, the Preaching of the Goſpel to them; <hi>She did not know,</hi> that is, ſhe did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ſhe did not prize and improve her Priviledges as ſhe ought, but ſtopped her Ear againſt the words of Chriſt; and cloſed her Eyes againſt the miraculous Works of Chriſt, till at laſt they were hidden from her Eyes. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That the time of a Peoples enjoying the Light and Liberty of the Goſpel, it is a limited day, it is a ſhort day, <hi>If thou hadſt known in this thy day.</hi> (2.) That it is the ſad and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Lot of the Goſpel not to be embraced, and entertained by a People, to whom it is in Mercy ſent, till it be too late, and the time of their Viſitation be paſt and over, <hi>Oh that thou hadſt known, but now</hi> thou ſhalt never know, <hi>now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="43">43 For the day ſhall come, that thine enemies ſhall caſt a Trench about thee, and compaſs thee round, and keep thee in on every ſide. 44 And ſhall lay thee even with the ground, and thy Children within thee, and they ſhall not leave
<pb facs="tcp:46556:114"/> in thee one ſtone upon another, Becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy Viſitation.</p>
               <p>Here we have a Prophetical Prediction of the total and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deſtruction of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who begirt the City round, burnt the Temple, ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the People, and brought ſuch Ruine and Deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, as no Hiſtory could ever parallel; the reaſon is aſſigned, <hi>becauſe they knew not the time of their Viſitation;</hi> that is, the time when God viſited them with his Goſpel, firſt by the Miniſtry of <hi>John,</hi> then by the Preaching of Chriſt himſelf, and afterwards by his Diſciples and Apoſtles. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That when God gives his Goſpel to a People, he gives that People a merciful and a gracious Viſitation. (2.) That for a People not to know, but neglect the time of their gracious Viſitation, it is a God provoking, and a Wrath-procuring Sin, <hi>Becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy Viſitation, therefore the time ſhall come, that thine Enemy ſhall lay thee even with the Ground, and not leave one ſtone upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> which Hiſtory tells us was literally fulfilled, when <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Rufus</hi> with his Plough, ploughed up the very Foundation Stones upon which the Temple ſtood. Lord! how has ſin laid the Foundation of Ruine in the moſt Flouriſhing Cities and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="45">45 And he went into the Temple, and began to caſt out them that ſold therein, and them that bought. 46 Saying unto them, It is writ, My houſe is the houſe of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of Thieves. 47 And he taught daily in the Temple, but the chief prieſts, and the Scribes, and the chief of the People, ſought to deſtroy him. 48 And could not find what they might do; for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were very attentive to hear him.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was our Bleſſed Saviour entered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but his firſt walk was to the Temple, and his firſt Work was to Purge and Reform it from abuſes, not to ruine and deſtroy it, becauſe it had been abuſed. But what was the Prophanation of the Temple that ſo offended our Saviour: <hi>Anſwer,</hi> in the Court of the Gentiles, the outward Court of the Temple, there was a publick Mart or Market kept, where were ſold Oxen, Sheep and Doves for Sacrifice, which otherwiſe the People muſt have brought up along with them from their Houſes; as a pretended eaſe therefore to the People, the Prieſts ordered theſe things to be Sold hard by the Altar; but our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour being juſtly offended at this Prophanation of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, caſt the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple. Teaching us, That there is a ſpecial Reverence due to God's Houſe, both for the Owners ſake, and the Service ſake; nothing but Holineſs can become the place where God is Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Beauty of Holineſs; the Reaſon is added, <hi>My houſe is the houſe of Prayer,</hi> where by Prayer is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the whole Worſhip and Service of God, of which Prayer is an eminent and principal part; That which gives Denomination to an Houſe, is moſt certainly the chief work to be done in that Houſe; now God's Houſe being called <hi>An Houſe of Prayer,</hi> implies, that Prayer is a chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Work to be performed in this Houſe; yet take we heed that we ſet not the Ordinances of God at variance one with another; we muſt not Idolize one Ordinance, and vilify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but reverence them all, and pay an awful reſpect to all Divine Inſtitutions. Our Bleſſed Saviour here in his Houſe of Prayer, Preach'd daily to the People, as well as Prayed with them; and all the People were as attentive to hear his Sermons, as he was conſtant at their Prayers. Prayer Sanctifies the Word, and the Word fits us for Prayer, if we would Glorify God, and Edify our ſelves, we muſt put Honour upon all the Ordinances of God, and diligently attend them upon all occaſions.</p>

               <p n="1">1 AND it came to paſs, that on one of thoſe days, as he taught the people in the Temple, and preached the Goſpel, the chief Prieſts and the Scribes came upon him with the Elders. 2 And ſpake unto him, ſaying, Tell us by what Authority thou doſt theſe things? or who is he that giveth thee this Authority? 3 And he anſwered and ſaid unto them, I will alſo ask you one thing and anſwer me. 4 The Baptiſm of John, Was it from Heaven? or of men? 5 And they reaſoned with themſelves, ſaying, If we ſhall ſay from Heaven, he will ſay, Why then believed ye him not? 6 But and if we ſay of men, all the people will ſtone us, for they be perſwaded that John was a Prophet. 7 And they anſwered, that they could not tell whence it was. 8 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, neither tell I you, By what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I do theſe things.</p>
               <p>The Phariſees having often quarrelled at our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine before, they call in queſtion his Miſſion and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now: Altho' they might eaſily have underſtood his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Miſſion by his Divine Miracles, for Almighty God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impowered any to work Miracles, that were not ſent by him. Our Bleſſed Saviour underſtanding their Deſign, gives them no direct Anſwer, but Replies to their Queſtion, by asking them another; <hi>The Baptiſm of John, was it from Heaven? or of men?</hi> that is, was it of Divine Inſtitution or of Humane Invention? plainly implying, that the calling of them who call themſelves the Miniſters of God, ought to be from God; <hi>No man ought to take that honour upon him, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron, Heb.</hi> 5.8. The Phariſees Reply, that they could not tell, whence <hi>John</hi> had his Miſſion and Authority; which was a manifeſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; they knew it, but durſt not own it. By refuſing to tell the Truth, they fall into a Lye againſt the Truth; thus one Sin enſnares and draws men on to the Commiſſion of more: Such as will not ſpeak exact Truth, according to their Knowledge, they fall into the ſin of Lying againſt their Knowledge, and their Conſcience; our Saviour anſwers them, <hi>Neither tell I you by what Authority I do theſe things;</hi> he doth not ſay, I cannot, or I will not tell you, but I do not, I need not tell you; becauſe the Miracles which I work before you, are a ſufficient Demonſtration of my Divine Commiſſion, that I am ſent of God amongſt you; becauſe God never ſet the Seal of his Omnipotency to a Lye, nor impowered any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor to work real Miracles.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Then began he to ſpeak to the People this parable; A certain man planted a Vineyard, and let it forth to Husbandmen, and went into a far Country for a long time. 10 And at the ſeaſon he ſent a Servant to the Husbandmen, that they ſhould give him of the fruit of the Vineyard, but the Husbandmen beat him, and ſent him away empty. 11 And again he ſent another Servant, and they beat him alſo, and entreated him ſhamefully, and ſent him away empty. 12 And Again he ſent the the third, and they wounded him alſo, and caſt him out. 13 Then ſaid the Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, What ſhall I do? I will ſend my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, it may be they will Reverence him, when they ſee him. 14 But when the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen ſaw him, they reaſoned among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, This is the Heir, come let us kill him, that the Inheritance may be ours. 15 So they caſt him out of the Vineyard, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him: What therefore ſhall the Lord of the Vineyard do unto them? 16 He ſhall come and deſtroy theſe Husbandmen, and ſhall give the Vineyard unto others; and when they heard it, they ſaid, God forbid. 17 And he
<pb facs="tcp:46556:115"/> beheld them and ſaid, What is this then that is written? The ſtone which the Builders reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the ſame is become the head of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 18 Whoſoever ſhall fall on this ſtone ſhall be broken, but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will grind him to powder. 19 And the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes the ſame hour ſought to lay hands upon him; but they feared the People; for they perceived, that he had ſpoken this Parable againſt them.</p>
               <p>In the Parable before us, the Jewiſh Church is compared to a Vineyard, God the Father to <hi>an Houſeholder,</hi> his <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pruning</hi> and <hi>fencing his Vineyard,</hi> denotes his Care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his Church with all needful Helps, and Means, to make it Fruitful; his <hi>Letting it out</hi> to Husbandmen, ſignifies the committing the Care of his Church to the Prieſts and Levites, the publick Paſtors and Governors of the Church; his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> are the Prophets and Apoſtles whom he ſent from time to time to admoniſh them to bring forth anſwerable Fruits to the Coſt which God had expended on them; <hi>his Son,</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Rulers of the Jewiſh Church ſlew and Murthered. So that the Deſign and Scope of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is to diſcover to the Jews, particularly to the Phariſees, their obſtinate impenitency, under all the means of Grace, their bloody Cruelty towards the Prophets of God, their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Guilt in Crucifying the Son of God; for all which God would unchurch them fiinally, Ruine their Nation, and ſet up a Church among the Gentiles, that ſhould bring forth better Fruits then the Jewiſh Church ever did. From the whole <hi>Note</hi> (1.) That the Church is God's Vineyard, a Vineyard is a place encloſed, a place well planter, well fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and exceeding dear and precious to the Planter, and the Owner of it. (2.) That as dear as God's Vineyard is unto him, in caſe of Barrenneſs and unfruitfulneſs, it is in great danger of being deſtroyed, and laid waſte by him. (3.) That the only way and courſe to engage God's Care over his Vineyard, and to prevent its being given to other Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it is to give him the Fruits of it; it is but a Vineyard that God lets out; it is no Inheritance; no People ever had ſo many Promiſes of God's Favour as the Jews; nor ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſo many Priviledges whilſt they continued in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as they did; but for rejecting Chriſt, and his Holy Doctrine, they are a deſpiſed, ſcattered People throughout the World. <hi>See the Notes on</hi> Mat. 21.39, 44.</p>
               <p n="20">20 And they watched him, and ſent forth ſpies which ſhould feign themſelves juſt men, that they might take hold of his words, that ſo they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the Governour. 21 And they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſaying, Maſter, We know that thou ſayeſt and teacheſt rightly, neither accepteſt thou the perſon of any, but teacheſt the way of God truly. 22 Is it lawful for us to give Tribute unto Ceſar, or not? 23 But he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their craftineſs, and ſaid unto them, Why tempt ye me? 24 Shew me a Penny; whoſe Image and Superſcription hath it? they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid Ceſar's. 25 And he ſaid unto them, Render therefore to Ceſar, the things which are Ceſars, and to God, the things that are God's. 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and they marvelled at his Anſwer, and held their peace.</p>
               <p>Both St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> tell us, that theſe Spies, ſent forth to enſnare our Saviour about paying Tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> were the Phariſees and <hi>Herodians;</hi> the former were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paying Tribute, looking upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour as an Uſurper, the latter were for it; Theſe two oppoſite Parties concluded, that let our Saviour anſwer how he would, they ſhould entrap him; if to pleaſe the Phariſees he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paying Tribute, then he is accuſed of Sedition; if to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the <hi>Herodians,</hi> he voted for paying Tribute, then he is pronounced an Enemy to the Liberty of his Country, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a popular Odium. But <hi>Obſerve</hi> with what wiſdom and caution our Lord Anſwers them: he calls for the <hi>Roman</hi> Penny, and asks them whoſe Superſcription it bare, <hi>they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Ceſar's; then ſays he, Render to Ceſar the things that are Ceſar's;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Your admitting the <hi>Roman</hi> Coyn amongſt you, is an Evidence that you are under Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; becauſe the Coyning and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Money is an Act of Sovereign Authority; therefore you having owned <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Authority over you, by accepting of his Coyn amongſt you, give unto him his juſt dues, and <hi>Render to Ceſar the things that are Ceſar</hi>'s. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That our Saviour was no Enemy to Magiſtracy and Civil Government; there was no truer Pay-maſter of the King's Dues, then he that was King of Kings; he preach'd it, and and he practiſed it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. (2.) Where a Kingdom is in Subjection to a Temporal Prince, whether by Deſcent, Election or by Conqueſt he derives his Title, the Subjects ought from a principle of Conſcience, to pay Tribute to him. (3.) That as Chriſt is no Enemy to the Civil Rights of Princes, and his Religion exempts none from paying their Civil Dues, ſo Princes ſhould be as careful not to rob him of his Divine Honour, as he is not to wrong them of their Civil Rights. As Chriſt requires all his Followers <hi>to render to Ceſar, the things that are Ceſar</hi>'s; ſo Princes ſhould oblige all their Subjects, <hi>To render unto God the things that are Gods.</hi>

               <p n="27">27 Then came unto him certain of the Sadduces which ſay there is no Reſurrection, and they asked him. 28 Saying, Maſter Moſes wrote unto us, if any mans Brother dye, having a wife, and he dye without chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that his Brother ſhould take his Wife, and raiſe up Seed unto his Brother. 29 There were therefore ſeven Brethren, and the firſt, took a wife, and dyed without Children. 30 And the ſecond took her to wife, and he dyed childleſs. 31 And the third took her, and in like manner the ſeventh alſo; and they left no Children, and dyed. 32 Laſt of all the Woman dyed alſo. 33 Therefore in the Reſurrection whoſe wife of them is ſhe, for ſeven had her to wife? 34 And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto them, The children of this World marry, and are given in marriage. 35 But they which ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the Reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. 36 Neither can they dye any more, for they are equal unto the Angels, and are the Children of God, being the Children of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. 37 Now that the dead are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, even Moſes ſhewed at the Buſh, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob. 38 For he is not a God of the Dead, but of the Living, for all live unto him.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having put the Phariſees and <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to ſilence in the foregoing Verſes, here the Sadduces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him, This Sect denied the Immortality of the Soul, and the Reſurrection of the Body, and as an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt both, they propound a Caſe to our Saviour, of a Woman that had Seven Husbands; they demand whoſe Wife of the Seven this Woman ſhall be at the Reſurrection? as if they had ſaid, if there be a Reſurrection of Bodies at the great Day, ſurely there will be a Reſurrection of Relations too, and the other World will be like this, in which Men will marry as they do here; and if ſo, <hi>whoſe wife of the ſeven ſhall this Woman be?</hi> they all having an equal claim to her? Now our Saviour for reſolving of this queſtion, firſt ſhews
<pb facs="tcp:46556:115"/> the different State of Men in this and in the other World; <hi>The Children of this World,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>marry and are given in Marriage,</hi> but in the Reſurrection they do neither; as if our Lord had ſaid, after Men have lived a while in this World, they dye, and therefore Marriage is neceſſary to maintain a Succeſſion of Mankind; but in the other World, Men ſhall become Immortal, and live for ever; and then the Reaſon of Marriage will wholly ceaſe; for when Men can dye no more, there will be no need of any new Supplies of Mankind. Secondly, Our Saviour having got clear of the Sadduces Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, by taking away the Ground and Foundation of it, he produces an Argument for the proof of the Soul's Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and the Bodies Reſurrection, thus, Thoſe to whom Almighty God pronounces himſelf a God, are alive, but God pronounces himſelf a God to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years after their Bodies were dead, therefore their Souls are yet alive, otherwiſe God could not be their God, <hi>For he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living:</hi> From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) That there is no Opinion ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, no error ſo monſtrous, that having had a Mother, will dye for lack of a Nurſe; the Beaſtly Opinion of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and of the Annihilation of the Body finds Sadduces, to profeſs and propagate it. <hi>Learn</hi> (2.) The certainty of another Life after this, in which Men ſhall be Eternally Happy, or Intolerably Miſerable, according as they behave themſelves here: Tho' ſome Men live like Beaſts, they ſhall not dye like them, neither ſhall their laſt End be like theirs. <hi>Note,</hi> (3.) The Glorified Saints in the Morning of the Reſurrection, ſhall be like unto the Glorious Angels; not like them in Eſſence and Nature, but like them in their Properties and Qualities, namely, in Holineſs and Purity, in Immortality and Incorruptibility; and alſo like them in their way and manner of Living. They ſhall no more ſtand in need of Meat or Drink, than the Angels do; but ſhall live the ſame Heavenly and Immortal Lives that the Angels live. <hi>Note</hi> (4.) That all thoſe that are in Covenant with God, whoſe God the Lord is, their Souls do immediately paſs into Glory, and their Bodies at the Reſurrection, ſhall be ſharers in the ſame Happineſs with their Souls; if God be juſt the Soul muſt Live, and the Body muſt Riſe; for Good Men muſt be Rewarded, and Wicked Men Puniſhed; God will moſt certainly, one time or other, plentifully Reward the Righteous, and Puniſh the Evil doers; but this being not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done in this Life, the juſtice of God requires it be done in the next.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Then certain of the Scribes anſwering, ſaid, Maſter, thou haſt well ſaid. 40 And after that they durſt not ask him any queſtion at all. 41 And he ſaid unto them, How ſay they that Chriſt is David's Son? 42 And David himſelf ſaith in the Book of Pſalms, the Lord ſaith unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand. 43 Till I make thine enemies thy Footſtool. 44 David therefore calleth him Lord, How is he then his Son.</p>
               <p>The Deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour in propounding this Queſtion to the Phariſees, how Chriſt could be <hi>David</hi>'s Son, when <hi>David</hi> by Inſpiration called him Lord, it was two-fold, (1.) To confute the People's Erroneous Opinion, touching the Perſon of the Meſſias, who they thought ſhould be a meer Man, of the Stock and Lineage of <hi>David</hi> only, and not the Son of God. (2.) To ſtrengthen the Faith of his Diſciples touching his Godhead, againſt the time that they ſhould ſee him Suffer and Riſe again: The place Chriſt alludes to, is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand; The Lord,</hi> That is, God the Father, <hi>ſaid to my Lord,</hi> that is to God the Son, who was to be Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, whom <hi>David</hi> calleth his Lord, both as God, and as Mediatour, his Lord by a Right of Creation and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo: now the queſtion our Saviour puts to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees is this, how Chriſt could be both <hi>David's</hi> Lord, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Son? No Son being Lord to his own Father; therefore if Chriſt were <hi>David</hi>'s Sovereign, he muſt be more than Man, more than <hi>David</hi>'s Son. As Man, ſo he was <hi>David</hi>'s Son; as God Man, ſo he was <hi>David</hi>'s Lord. <hi>Note</hi> hence, (1.) That altho' Chriſt was truly and really Man, yet was he more than a meer Man; he was Lord unto, and the Salvation of his own Fore-fathers. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) That the only way to reconcile the Scriptures, which ſpeak concerning Chriſt, is to believe and acknowledge him to be both God and Man in one Perſon: The Meſſiah as Man, was to come forth out of <hi>David</hi>'s Loyns, but as God man he was <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, his Sovereign and Saviour; as Man he was <hi>David</hi> s Son, as God man he was Lord to his own Father.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Then in the audience of all the people, he ſaid unto his Diſciples. 46 Beware of the Scribes, which deſire to walk in long Robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Seats in the Synagogues, and the chief Rooms at Feaſts. 47 Which devour widows houſes, and for a ſhew make long prayers, the ſame ſhall receive greater Damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, What it is that our Saviour condemns, not Civil Salutations in the Market-place, not the chief Seats in the Synagogue, not the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts, but their fond affecting of theſe things, and their ambitious aſpiring after them; it was not their Taking, but their loving the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts which our Saviour condemns, God is the God of Order; there may and ought to be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency among Perſons; God commands us to give Honour to whom Honour is due, but Pride and Ambition are dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and hateful Vices, eſpecially in ſuch as are Preachers, and ought to be Patterns of Humility. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) How our Saviour condemns the Phariſees for their groſs Hypocriſy, in colouring over their abominable Covetouſneſs with a ſpecious pretence of Religion, making long Prayers in the Temple and Synagogues for Widows, and thereupon perſwading them to give Bountifully to <hi>Corban,</hi> that is, the Common Treaſury for the Temple; ſome part of which was employed for their Maintenance. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is no new thing for Deſigning Hypocrites, to cover the fowleſt Tranſgreſſions with the Cloak of Religion; thus the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees made their Prayers a cloak and cover for their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</p>

               <p>At the door of the Temple, thro' which all the People paſſed in and out, who came up three times a Year at the Solemn Feaſts, to Worſhip Almighty God in his own Houſe, there was a Cheſt ſet, <hi>(like the poor Mans Box in ſome of our, Churches)</hi> into which all Perſons caſt in their Free Will Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Oblations, which were employed either for the uſe of the Poor, or for the Service of the Temple; and what was thus given our Saviour calls an Offering to God, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Theſe of their abundance have caſt in unto the Offering of God.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That what we rightly give to the Relief of the Poor, or for the Service, and towards the Support of God's publick Worſhip, is Conſecrated to God, and as ſuch is accepted of him, and ought to be eſteemed by us. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (2.)

Oh Bleſſed Saviour, while now thou ſitteſt at thy Father's Right Hand in Glory, thou ſeeſt every hand that is ſtretched forth to the relief of thy poor Members here on Earth,</p>
               <p>But a certain poor widow caſt in two mites.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:116"/>
               <p>Several Circumſtances relating both to the Perſon and the Action are here <hi>Obſervable,</hi> as (1.) The Perſon that offered was a Widow, the Married Woman is under the careful Proviſion of her Husband, if ſhe ſpends, he earns, but the Widow has no hands but her own to work for her. (2.) She was <hi>a poor Widow,</hi> poverty added to the Sorrow of her Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood; ſhe had no rich Joynture to live upon; it is ſome alleviation of the Sorrow that attends Widow-hood, when the Hand is left full, tho' the Bed be left empty; this Widow was needy and deſolate, but yet gives; ſome in her Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would have look'd upon themſelves as having Right to receive what was given by others, rather than to give any thing themſelves. (3) <hi>Obſerve</hi> her Bounty and Munificence in giving, <hi>her two Mites</hi> are proclaimed by Chriſt, to be more <hi>then all the rich Mens</hi> Talents; more in reſpect of the mind and affection of the Giver, more with reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Gift; a Mite to her being more than Pounds to others, Pounds were little to them, two Mites were all to her, ſhe leaves her ſelf nothing; ſo that the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave not only more than any of them all, but more then they all. Chriſt's Eye look'd at once into the bottom of her Purſe, and into the bottom of her Heart, and judge of the Offering, rather by the Mind of the Giver, than by the value of the Gift. From this inſtance we <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That the Poorer, yea the pooreſt ſort of People, are not exempted from good Works; but even they muſt and ought to exerciſe Charity according to their Ability. This poor Widow that had not a Pound, nay not a Penny, preſents God with a Farthing. (2.) That in all Works of pious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which we perform, God looks at the Heart, the Will, and the Affection of the Giver; more then at the largeneſs and liberality of the Gift; it is not ſaid, the Lord loveth a Liberal Giver, but a chearful Giver; <hi>He accepteth the Gift according to what a Man hath, and not according to what he hath not;</hi> Oh our God, the pooreſt of us thy Servants have our two Mites alſo, a Soul and a Body, perſwade and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to offer them both unto thee, tho' they are thine own already, yet wilt thou graciouſly accept them, and oh how happy ſhall we be in thy acceptation.</p>

               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being now ready to depart from the Temple, never more after this Entering into it, and his Diſciples ſhewing him with Wonder and Admiration, the magnificent Structures and Buildings thereof, apprehending that in regard of its Invincible Strength, it could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; not conſidering, that Sin will undermine and blow up the moſt magnificent and famou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That Sin has laid the Foundation of Ruine in the moſt flouriſhing Cities and Kingdoms; <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Glory of the World, is here by ſin threatned to be made a Deſolation. (2.) That the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God are to be feared, and ſhall be Fulfilled, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appearing Improbabilities there may be to the contrary.

               <p n="20">20 And when ye ſhall ſee Jeruſalem compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Armies, then know that the Deſolation thereof is nigh. 21 Then let them which are in Judea flee to the Mountains, and let them which are in the midſt of it, depart out, and let not them that are in the Countries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereinto. 22 For theſe be the days of Vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 23 But wo unto them which are with Child, and to them that give Suck in thoſe days, for there ſhall be great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs in the Land, and wrath upon this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 24 And they ſhall fall by the edge of the Sword, and ſhall be led away Captive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations, and Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 25 And there ſhall be Signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the Earth, diſtreſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with perplexity, the Sea, and the Waves roaring. 26 Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the Earth, for the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken. 27 And then ſhall they ſee the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 And when theſe things come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your Heads, for your Redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe is this, As ſoon as ye ſhall ſee the <hi>Roman</hi> Army appear before the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (called by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark, The abomination of Deſolation,</hi> that is, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which is ſuch an abomination to you, and the occaſion of ſuch Deſolation wherever it goes) then let every one that values his own Safety, fly as far and as faſt as he can, as <hi>Lot</hi> fled from the Flames of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and be glad, if by flight he can ſave his Life, tho' he loſes all beſides. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That when Almighty God is pouring forth his Fury upon a ſinful People, it is both lawful and a neceſſary Duty, by flight to endeavour to ſhelter our ſelves from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Calamity and Deſolation; <hi>When ye ſee Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem compaſſed with Armies, flee to the Mountains. Obſerve</hi> farther, the dreadful Relation that our Saviour here gives of thoſe Deſolating Calamities which were coming upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> partly from the <hi>Roman</hi> Army without, and partly from the Seditions and Factions of the Zealots within, who committed ſuch outrages and ſlaughters, that there were no leſs than an Hundred thouſand Jews ſlain, and Ninety ſeven thouſand taken Priſoners. They that bought our Saviour for Thirty Pence, were now themſelves ſold Thirty for a Penny. Now did the Temple it ſelf become a Sacrifice, a whole Burnt-offering, and was conſumed to Aſhes. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, What Encouragement Chriſt gives to all his Faithful Diſciples and Followers, he bids them look up, and lift up their Heads when theſe Calamities came upon others; look up with Confidence and Joy, for your Redemption, Salvation, and Deliverance then approacheth. God had a Remnant which he deſigned ſhould ſurvive that Deſtruction, to be an Holy Seed; theſe are called upon to look up with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and joy, when the hearts of others were failing them for fear. And thus ſhall it be at the General Day of Judgment (of which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Viſitation was a Type) Lord! how will the Glory and Terror of that Day dazzle the Eyes, and terrify the Hearts of all the Enemies of Chriſt, but delight the Eyes, and rejoyce the Heart of all that love and fear him, that ſerve and obey him? then may the friends of Chriſt <hi>look up, and lift up their heads, for their full Redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh.</hi>

               <p n="29">29 And he ſpake to them a Parable, Behold the Fig-tree, and all the Trees. 30 When they now ſhoot forth, ye ſee and know of your ſelves, that Summer is now nigh at hand. 31 So likewiſe ye, when ye ſee theſe things come to paſs, know ye, that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. 32 Verily I ſay unto you, This generation ſhall not paſs away till all be fulfilled. 33 Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour declares the certainty of his Coming to viſit <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for all her barbarous and bloody Cruelty towards himſelf, his Prophets and Apoſtles; he is pleaſed to ſet forth this by the Similitude of the Fig-Tree, whoſe beginning to bud, declares the Summer at hand; thus our Saviour tells them, that when they ſhould ſee the Fore-mentioned Signs, they might conclude the Deſtruction of their City and Temple to be nigh at hand; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome of that Generation then Living, did ſee theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions Fulfilled. <hi>Learn,</hi> that God is no leſs punctual in the Execution of his Threatnings upon Incorrigible Sinners, then he is faithful in the performance of his promiſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own People: The Truth and Veracity of God, is as much concerned to execute his Threatnings, as it is to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="34">34 And take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your Hearts be over-charged with Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drunkenneſs, and the cares of this Life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares. 35 For as a ſnare it ſhall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole Earth; 36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>Here our Lord cautions his Diſciples againſt ſuch a Diſtemper and Indiſpoſition of Mind, as may render them unfit and unready for his Coming and Appearance, and to take heed of two dangerous Sins, namely, Voluptuouſneſs and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, which above any other Sins will indiſpoſe us for the Duty of Watchfulneſs. There is a three-fold Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our Saviour fore-warns us of theſe Sins, with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Day of Judgment, (1.) Becauſe they are <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata praecurrentia,</hi> certain prognoſticks of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approaching; as it was in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of Man be. (2.) Becauſe they are <hi>peccata Accelerantia,</hi> they do not only fore-tell, but haſten the Coming of Chriſt, to ſee the World drowned in volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs and earthly-mindedneſs, in ſecurity and ſenſuality, is not only a Sign to fore-tell, but a ſin that haſtens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pulls down Vengeance upon a wicked World.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:117"/> (3) Chriſt bids us beware of theſe Sins with reference to the Day of Judgment, becauſe theſe Sins they are <hi>deriſioria judicii,</hi> they beget in Men a prophane Spirit of Scoffing and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, at the Notices of Chriſt's appearing to Judgment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. <hi>In the laſt days there ſhall come Scoffers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own Luſts, and ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming.</hi> Our Saviour having thus warn'd them of theſe Sins, he next exhorts them to Watchfulneſs, <hi>Watch ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for as a ſnare that day will come upon you;</hi> that is, very ſuddenly, and very unexpectedly; a ſnare has a threefold Property, to catch ſuddenly, to hold ſurely, to deſtroy certainly. Our Lord's coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was very unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and his coming to us by Death and Judgment, will ſteal upon us if we be not watchful. <hi>Watch</hi> we then, for our Lord will come, at what hour he will come cannot certainly be known; there is no time in which we can promiſe or aſſure our ſelves that our Lord will not come; the time of our whole Life is little enough to prepare for his Coming. Our Preparation for, will be no acceleration or haſtning of our Lord's Coming. And oh, how dreadful will his Coming be, if we be found off our Watch, and altogether unready for his Appearance? Appear we muſt in Judgment, but ſhall not be able to ſtand in the Judgment; ſee Chriſt we ſhall as a Judge, but not behold him as a Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="37">37 And in the day-time he was Teaching in the Temple, and at Night he went out and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the Mount called the Mount of Olives. 38 And all the people came early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in the Temple, for to hear him.</p>
               <p>Our Lord had exhorted his Diſciples in the fore-going Verſes, to Diligence and Prayer, here he ſets an Example of both before them. Buſying himſelf in God's Service all the day, and at Night ſpending much time in Prayer; in the Day-time he was in the Temple Preaching, in the Evening he was on the Mount of Olives Praying. Lord! What an Example of indefatigable Zeal and Diligence haſt thou ſet before thy Miniſters and Members. Oh that when our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comes we may be found Working, our People Watching, and both they and we waiting for the joyful Coming of our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
               <p n="1">1 NOW the Feaſt of unleavened Bread, drew nigh which is called the Paſſover. 2 And the chief Prieſts and Scribes ſought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.</p>
               <p>This Chapter gives a ſad and ſorrowful Relation of the Chief Prieſt's Conſpiracy againſt the Life of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in which we have Three Particulars <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) The Perſons making this Conſpiracy, <hi>The Chief Prieſts, Scribes and Elders,</hi> that is, the whole Jewiſh Sanhedrin, or General Council; they all lay their malicious Heads together, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the Deſtruction of the Holy and Innocent Jeſus. Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That General Councils have erred, and may Err Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally, both in matters of Doctrine and Practice; ſo did this General Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> conſiſting of Chief Prieſts, Doctors and Elders, with the High Prieſt their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; They did not believe Jeſus to be the Meſſias, after all the Miracles wrought before their Eyes, but ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly put him to Death. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The manner of this Conſpiracy againſt the Life of our bleſſed Saviour, it was Clandeſtine, Secret and Subtle, <hi>They conſulted how they might take him by craft, and put him to Death. Learn</hi> thence, That Satan makes uſe of the ſubtilty of crafty men, and abuſeth their Parts as well as their Power, for his own Purpoſes and Deſigns; the Devil never ſends a Fool of his Errand. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Circumſtance of Time when this Conſpiracy was managed <hi>at the Feaſt of the Paſſover;</hi> It was a Cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, to Execute Malefactors at their Solemn Feaſts, at which time all the Jews came up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Sacrifice, and then they put Malefactors to Death, that all Iſrael might ſee and fear, and not do ſo wickedly. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Feaſt of the Paſſover was waited for by the Jews, as a fit opportunity to put our Saviour to Death. The only Objection was, that it might occaſion a Tumult and Uproar amongſt the People, there being ſuch a mighty Concourſe at that Time in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But <hi>Judas</hi> making them a proffer, they readily comply with the Motion, and reſolve to take the firſt Opportunity to put our Saviour to Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then entered Satan into Judas, ſirnamed Iſcariot, being of the number of the Twelve. 4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief Prieſts and Captains, how he might betray him unto them. 5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him Money. 6 And he promiſed, and ſought opportunity to betray him unto them, in the abſence of the Multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) The Perſon Betraying our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Judas; Judas</hi> a Profeſſor, <hi>Judas</hi> a Preacher, <hi>Judas</hi> an Apoſtle, and one of the Twelve, whom Chriſt had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the World to be his deareſt Friend, one of his Family and Houſhold; ſhall we wonder to find Friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly or unfaithful to us, when our Saviour had a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in his own Family. (2.) <hi>Obſerve</hi> The heinous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Judas</hi> his Sin, he <hi>Betrayed Jeſus;</hi> Jeſus his Maker, Jeſus his Maſter. It is no ſtrange or uncommon thing, for the vileſt of ſins, and moſt horrid impieties, to be acted by ſuch Perſons as make the moſt Eminent Profeſſion of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Religion. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) What was the occaſion that led <hi>Judas</hi> to the Commiſſion of this Sin; it was his inordinate Love of Money. I do not find that <hi>Judas</hi> had any particular Malice, Spite, or Ill will againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but a baſe and unworthy Spirit of Covetouſneſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt him, and this made him ſell his Maſter. Covetouſneſs is the Root-ſin; an eager and inſatiable Thirſt after the World, is the Parent of the moſt monſtrous and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sins; for which Reaſon our Saviour doubles his Caution, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs;</hi> it ſhews us both the great danger of the Sin, and the great care that we ought to take to preſerve our ſelves from it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Then came the day of unleavened Bread, when the Paſſover was to be killed. 8 And he ſent Peter and John, ſaying, Go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us the Paſſover, that we may eat. 9 And they ſaid unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 10 And he ſaid unto them, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold when ye are entered into the city, there ſhall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him into the Houſe where he entereth in. 11 And ye ſhall ſay unto the good man of the Houſe, the Maſter ſaith unto thee, Where is the Gueſt-chamber, where I ſhall eat the Paſſover with my Diſciples? 12 And he ſhall ſhew you a large upper Room furniſhed, there make ready. 13 And they went and found as he had ſaid unto them, and they made ready the Paſſover.</p>
               <p>The time for the Celebration of the Paſſover being now at hand, Chriſt ſends two of his Diſciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to prepare what was needful in order thereunto; and here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) An eminent Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Chriſt's Divinity in Fore-telling his Diſciples all the particular Occurrences and Circumſtances which they ſhould meet with in the City, <hi>as a man bearing a pitcher of Water,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) How readily the Heart of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder was diſpoſed to receive our Saviour and his Diſciples, and to accommodate them with all things needful upon this occaſion. Our Bleſſed Saviour had not a Lamb of his own, and peradventure not Money wherewith to purchaſe one; yet he finds a more agreeable Accommodation in this poor Man's Houſe, then if he had dwelt in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Ivory Palace, and had the Proviſions of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Table. When Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:46556:117"/> has a Paſſover to Celebrate, he will diſpoſe the Hearts of his Children and Servants to a free Reception of himſelf. The Room that Chriſt will enter into, it muſt be a large Room, an upper Room, a Room furniſhed and prepared; <hi>a large Room</hi> is the Emblem of an enlarged Heart, enlarged with Love, with Joy and Thankfulneſs; <hi>an upper Room,</hi> is an Heart exalted, not puft up with Pride, but lifted up by Heavenly Meditations; and a <hi>Room furniſhed,</hi> is a Soul adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Graces of the Holy Spirit; into ſuch an Heart doth Chriſt enter, and there delight to dwell; <hi>Here is my reſt for ever,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 And when the hour was come, he ſate down, and the Twelve Apoſtles with him. 15 And he ſaid unto them, With deſire have I deſired to eat this Paſſover with you before I ſuffer. 16 For I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. 17 And he took the Cup and gave Thanks, and ſaid, Take this and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it among your ſelves. 18 For I ſay unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, until the kingdom of God ſhall come. 19 And he took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them ſaying, This is my Body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of me. 20 Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo the Cup after Supper, Saying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you. 21 For behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table. 22 And truly the Son of man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it was determined, but wo unto that Man by whom he is Betrayed. 23 And they began to enquire among themſelves, which of them it was that ſhould do this thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) What ardency of Deſire, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of Affection, our holy Lord expreſſes to Celebrate the Paſſover with his Diſciples, and to Adminiſter the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Supper to them before he left them; <hi>with deſire have I deſired to eat with you before I ſuffer.</hi> Thence <hi>Learn,</hi> That it is very neceſſary when Sufferings do appear, eſpecially when Death does approach, to have immediate Recourſe to the Table of the Lord, which affords both an Antidote againſt Fear, and is Reſtaurative to our Faith. Chriſt the Night before he Suffered, Communicated with his Diſciples. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The unexampled Boldneſs of the impudent Traitor <hi>Judas,</hi> tho' he had ſold his Maſter, he preſumes to ſit down at the Table with him, and with the other Diſciples; had the preſence of <hi>Judas</hi> polluted this Ordinance to any but himſelf, doubtleſs our Saviour would not have ſuffered him to approach unto it. It <hi>Teaches</hi> us, That altho' nothing be more ordinary then for unholy Perſons to preſs in to the Holy Ordinances of God, which they have no Right (whilſt ſuch) to approach unto, yet their Preſence pollutes the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances only to themſelves. Holy Perſons are not polluted by their Sins, therefore ought not to be diſcouraged from coming, by their preſence. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) Chriſt did not Name <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſay, Oh thou perfidious Traitor! but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Doubtleſs Chriſt did not name him, becauſe he would not provoke him; he did not name him, becauſe he would not drive him to deſpair, but draw him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But Lord thou knoweſt us, when thou nameſt us not: Oh how ſad is it for any of thy Family, who pretend Friendſhip with thee, to conſpire againſt thee! and after they have eat of thy Bread, to lift up the heel againſt thee? <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) That tho' <hi>Judas</hi> was not named, yet he ſaw himſelf pointed at by our Saviour; <hi>Behold the hand that Betrayeth me is on the Table;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> his Heart told him, whoſe hand that was; yea, tho' <hi>Judas</hi> heard that dreadful Sentence denounced againſt him, <hi>Wo to the Man by whom the Son of Man is Betrayed;</hi> yet is he no more Blank'd then Innocency it ſelf: This Shameleſs Man had the Impudence to ſay to our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> tho' St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays it not, the other Evangeliſts tell us, that Chriſt anſwered him, <hi>Thou ſayeſt it.</hi> Did not <hi>Judas,</hi> (think we) bluſh extremely, hang down his Guilty Head, at ſo galling an Intimation? nothing leſs, we read not of any thing like it. Lord! How does obſtinacy in Sinning Steel the Brow, and render it uncapable of all relenting Impreſſions. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Celebration of the Paſſover, followed the Inſtitution of the Lord's Supper; where we have <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,</hi> The Author, the Time, the Elements, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Actions: (1.) <hi>Obſerve</hi> the Author of this new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jeſus took Bread. Learn</hi> thence, That to inſtitute a Sacrament is the ſole Prerogative of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the Church has no power to make new Sacraments; it is only her Duty to Celebrate thoſe which our Saviour has made. (2.) The Time of the Inſtitution, the Night before the Paſſion, <hi>the Night in which he was Betrayed, he took Bread.</hi> (3.) The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Elements, <hi>Bread and Wine;</hi> Bread repreſenting the Body, and Wine the Blood of our Redeemer; Bread being an abſolutely neceſſary Food, a common and obvious Food, a ſtrengthning and refreſhing Food; and Wine being the moſt excellent drink, the moſt pleaſant and delightful, the moſt Cordial and Reſtaurative; for theſe Reaſons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others did Chriſt Conſecrate, and ſet theſe Creatures apart for thoſe Holy Purpoſes for which he deſigned them. (4.) The Miniſterial Actions, Breaking of the Bread, and Bleſſing of the Cup; <hi>Jeſus took Bread,</hi> that is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and ſet it apart, from common Uſe, for holy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; <hi>He bleſſed it,</hi> that is, he prayed for a Bleſſing upon it, and <hi>brake it,</hi> thereby ſhadowing forth his Body broken upon the Croſs; and <hi>he gave</hi> it to his Diſciples, ſaying, This broken Bread ſignifies my Body, which is ſuddenly to be broken upon the Croſs, for the Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Loſt World; <hi>Do you likewiſe this, in remembrance of my Death;</hi> as to the Cup, Chriſt having ſet it apart by Prayer and Thankſgiving, he commands his Diſciples to Drink all of it; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this Cup is the new Teſtament in my Blood;</hi> that is, The Wine in this Cup doth repreſent the ſhedding of my Blood, by which the New Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt GOD and Man is ratified and confirmed; <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> ſays our Saviour; whence we gather, That every Communicant has as undoubtedly a Right to the Cup, as he has to the Bread in the Lord's Supper; therefore for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to deny the Cup to the Common People is Sacriledge, and directly contrary to Chriſt's Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="24">24 And there was alſo a ſtrife amongſt them, which of them ſhould be accounted the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. 25 And he ſaid unto them, the Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them; and they that exerciſe Authority upon them are called Benefactors. 26 But ye ſhall not be ſo; For he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve. 27 For whether is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, He that ſitteth at meat? or he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth? Is not he that ſitteth at Meat? But I am among you as he that ſerveth.</p>
               <p>If theſe Words be not placed out of Order, by St. <hi>Luke here,</hi> it may ſeem very ſtrange, that the Apoſtles immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after their Receiving the Sacrament, ſhould entertain their Minds with thoughts of Precedency and Superiority, and much ſtranger yet, that they ſhould Diſcourſe openly of ſuch a Subject as this, eſpecially conſidering what our Saviour had juſt before told them, that <hi>he was betrayed into the hands of Sinners;</hi> but whether at this time or not, it is moſt certain, at ſome time or other a ſtrife was found amongſt them, <hi>which ſhould be the Greateſt;</hi> now that our Saviour might effectually quench theſe unhappy Sparks of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were kindled in his Apoſtles Minds, he tells them, that Supremacy and Dominion belongs to Secular Princes, not to Evangelical Paſtors, who ought to carry themſelves with Humility and Condeſcention, one towards another. Not that Chriſt directs to a parity and equality
<pb facs="tcp:46556:118"/> amongſt his Miniſters, or forbids the Preheminency of ſome over others; but the affecting of Superiority, and the love of Preheminency, is that which our Saviour diſalloweth. <hi>Learn</hi> (1.) That ſo far ought the Miniſters of Chriſt to be from affecting a Domination and Superiority of Power over their Fellow Brethren, that in imitation of Chriſt, their Lord and Maſter, they ought to account themſelves Fellow-Servants; <hi>I am among you as one that ſerveth.</hi> (2.) That ſuch Miniſters as do Love and Affect Preheminency and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority are moſt unfit for it, and they deſerve it beſt which ſeek it leaſt. (3.) That the Dignity and Honour which the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould chiefly and only affect, is in another World; and the way to be greateſt and higheſt there, is to be low and humble here; mean in our own Eyes, and little in our own eſteem; <hi>Whoſoever is chief,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>let him be your Servant.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, What an Honourable Acknowledgment Chriſt makes of the Conſtancy of his Diſciples Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards him; <hi>Ye are they that have continued with me in my Temptations;</hi> that is, in my Afflictions, Tryals, and Sufferings. It is an eaſy matter to abide with Chriſt in days of Peace, in times of Conſolation, but when we are under Afflictions, Temptations and Troubles, then to abide and keep cloſe to Chriſt, this is the proof of Love and Friendſhip: And as Chriſt makes an honourable mention of their conſtancy towards him, ſo he preſently aſſures them of an honourable Reward; <hi>I appoint unto you a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Learn</hi> hence, That ſuch as are Sharers with Chriſt in his Sufferings, ſhall certainly Communicate with him in his Glory; <hi>If we Suffer with him, we ſhall Reign with him.</hi> And whereas our Saviour promiſes his Apoſtles, <hi>To ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Thrones with him, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael;</hi> we may gather, That ſuch Miniſters as do moſt Service for Chriſt and forſake moſt to follow him, and continue in Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tribulation with him, ſhall in his Kingdom partake of moſt Honour and Dignity with him and from him; <hi>You ſhall eat and drink in my Kingdom, and ſit on Thrones judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Twelve Tribes of Iſrael;</hi> poſſibly the Apoſtles, and all the Zealous, Faithful, and Laborious Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be nearer his Throne in Heaven, than either Saints or Angels; nearer than the Angels, becauſe by Chriſt's aſſuming the Humane Nature, they are more nearly allyed to him; he is their Friend, but our Brother; and nearer than other Saints, as having done more eminent Service for Chriſt, and brought more Honour and Glory to him by a Laborious Diligence in their Place and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that turn many to Righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat. 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not, and when thou art Converted, ſtrengthen thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall give (1.) The general ſenſe of the words; (2.) The particular Matters contained in them. (3.) The ſpecial Obſervations from them. The Senſe of the Words is this; As for you my Diſciples in general, and for thee <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, I muſt tell thee, that Satan hath accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you all before God; and deſired that he may have the ſifting of you all, by his winnowing Winds of Temptation and Perſecution, that he may ſhake your Faith, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken your Confidence. But I have prayed for you all, and particularly for thy ſelf, who art in greateſt danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe ſo confident of thine own Strength and Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thy Faith, tho ſeverely ſhaken, may not utterly fail; and when by Repentance thou art Recovered from thy Fall, be careful to confirm and ſtrengthen others, that they fall not in like manner. The particular matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe words are three, a Chriſtians Danger, a Chriſtians Safety, and a Chriſtians Duty: (1.) a Chriſtians Danger, <hi>Satan hath deſired to ſift you.</hi> Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Perſon particularly warned of the Danger, <hi>Simon, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> the Doubling of the Word doubtleſs carries a ſpecial intimation with it; it denotes the greatneſs and nearneſs of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Danger, his own ſecurity and inſenſibleneſs of that danger, and the great affection of Chriſt his Monitors to give him warning of his Danger. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, and that is of a Deviliſh Conſpiracy againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all the Apoſtles; <hi>Satan hath deſired to have you;</hi> to have you for his own, if it might be; to have you, as Believers, rather then other Men; to have you as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Believers, rather than other Chriſtians; and to have you, as Apoſtles and Miniſters, rather than other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Believers. And as Satan has deſired to have you, ſo <hi>to ſift you too, to winnow you as Wheat.</hi> Here <hi>Note,</hi> That Satan has his Winnowing Winds of Temptation, and his Tempeſtuous Winds of Perſecution, for the ſifting of God's Children. <hi>Note</hi> further, That it is the Wheat, the good Corn, that Satan Winnows; not Chaff, not Droſs; Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are all Chaff, and nothing but Droſs, Satan will not be at the pains to ſift and winnow them: But what is this Sifting? Anſwer, in ſifting two things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, (1.) The agitation, ſhaking, and toſſing of the Corn from ſide to ſide. (2.) The Separation of the Corn from the Chaff and Duſt; Satan intends the former, GOD effects the latter; <hi>Cribratione non perditur, ſed purgatur fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum; The Corn is improved, not impaired by Winnowing.</hi> The Saints of God ſhall be no loſers in the end, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Temptations, how many and ſtrong ſoever they may be in the way. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Chriſtians Safety; <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The Care that Chriſt had of <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him of all Believers; <hi>I have prayed for thee;</hi> for thee as a Believing Chriſtian, and for thee as a Tempted Chriſtian: and it is not ſaid, I will pray for thee, but I have Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee: Chriſt prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he had need of Chriſt's Prayer; Chriſt Prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> as ſoon as ever Satan deſired to ſift <hi>Peter:</hi> Our Interceſſor is full as nimble and ſpeedy in his Suit for us, as Satan is in his Accuſations againſt us; he has deſired, but I have prayed; he is a potent Aſſailant, but thou haſt a powerful Aſſiſtant. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Subject Matter Prayed for, <hi>That thy Faith fail not;</hi> not that thy Faith be not aſſaulted, not that thy Faith be not ſhaken, but that thy Faith may not fail by an abſolute and total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency. The third Particular is the Chriſtians Duty; <hi>When thou art Converted, strengthen thy Brethren: When Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> that is, when Recovered from thy Fall, when Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon thy Repentance to the Divine Favour; (This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is not from a State of Sin; <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo Converted before, but it was from an Act of Sin, into which he ſhould Lapſe and Relapſe; <hi>Strengthen thy Brethren,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſtabliſh others in the Faith from which thou art ſhamefully fallen thy ſelf: Now the Leſſons of Inſtructions from the whole, are theſe; (1.) That Temptations are like ſiftings, God ſifts to purge away our duſt and droſs, Satan ſifts, not to get out the Chaff, but to boult out the Flower, his Temptations are Levelled againſt our Faith. (2.) That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan has a continual Deſire to be Sifting and Winnowing God's Flower. Satan's own Children are all Bran, all Chaff, theſe he ſifts not: God's Children have Flower mix'd with Bran, good Wheat mix'd with Chaff; theſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſift, winnow and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n; not to ſeparate the Bran and Droſs, but to deſtroy the Flower. <hi>Learn</hi> (3.) That the interceſſion of Chriſt gives Security, Satisfaction and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to all Believers; that tho' their Faith may by Temptations be ſhaken and aſſaulted, yet that it ſhall never be finally vanquiſh'd and overcome; <hi>I have prayed that thy Faith fail not.</hi> (4.) That lapſed Chriſtians when Recovered and Reſtored, ought to endeavour to Reſtore and Recover, to ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh others; <hi>When thou art Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:118"/>33 And he ſaid unto him, Lord, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go with thee; both into priſon, and to death. 34 And he ſaid, I tell thee Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Cock ſhall not Crow this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thou ſhalt thrice deny that thou knoweſt me.</p>
               <p>St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Reſolution to accompany Chriſt, both to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to Death, was Holy and Good; but his too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Opinion of his own Strength and Ability ſo to do, without a Divine Aid and Aſſiſtance, was his failing and infirmity. Self-confidence is a ſin too too incident to the holieſt and beſt of Men. Little did <hi>Peter</hi> think, What a Feather he ſhould be in the Wind of Temptation, if once God left him to himſelf, and to Satan's Aſſaults. <hi>Learn</hi> farther, How hard a matter it is for a Chriſtian to excel in Gifts, and not to be over-confident and conceited. To ſee a Man eminent in Gifts, and yet exemplary in Humility, is a rare ſight; if we ſtand in the Evil Day, 'tis an humble fear of Falling that muſt enable us to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="35">35 And he ſaid unto them, When I ſent you without Purſe, and Scrip, and Shoes, Lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 36 Then ſaid he unto them, But now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his Scrip; and he that hath no Sword, let him ſell his Garment and buy one. 37 For I ſay unto you, That this that is written muſt yet be accompliſhed in me; And he was reckoned among the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; For the things concerning me have an end. 38 And they ſaid, Lord, behold, here are two Swords, and he ſaid unto them, It is enough.</p>
               <p>As if our Lord had ſaid, Hitherto I have been with you, and you have had my ſpecial Protection, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proviſion, tho' you went without Purſe, Scrip or Sword. But the Time is now at hand when I muſt leave you; when your Friends will be few, and your Enemies many; therefore make ſuch Preparation for your ſelves, as Prudence ſhall direct: Indeed my Sufferings will be firſt; I muſt be numbred with the Tranſgreſſors, and all things that are written of me muſt be accompliſhed, and will ſuddenly be fulfilled; and after me you will next come upon the Stage, therefore prepare and provide for it. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſt having fore-warned his Members, but eſpecially his Miniſters, of the Dangers, Diſtreſſes and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that they are to conflict and encounter with; it is their Duty, by Faith and Patience, with Courage and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reſolution, to be well armed and prepared againſt them.</p>
               <p n="39">39 And he came out, and went as he was wont to the Mount of Olives; and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples alſo followed him. 40 And when he was at the place, he ſaid unto them, Pray that ye enter not into Temptation. 41 And he was withdrawn from them about a ſtones caſt; and kneeled down and prayed, ſaying. 42 Father, if thou be willing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Cup from me; nevertheleſs, not my Will, but thine be done. 43 And there appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, ſtrengthning him. 44 And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his Sweat was as it were great drops of Blood, falling down to the Ground. 45 And when he roſe up from Prayer, and was come to his Diſciples, he found them ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sorrow. 46 And he ſaid unto them, Why ſleep ye? riſe and pray, leſt ye enter into Temptation.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being now come to the Mount of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> and having entered with his Diſciples into the Garden near it, whither he uſed to retire and pray. In this place he falls into a bitter and bloody Agony, in which he prayed with wonderful Fervour and Importunity; his Sufferings were now coming on a great pace, and he meets them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees, and would be found in a Praying poſture. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Prayer is the beſt Preparative for, as well as the moſt powerful Support under the heavieſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that can befal us. As to this Prayer of our Saviour in his Agony, many particulars are very <hi>Obſervable,</hi> As (1.) The Time when he Prayed thus extraordinarily, it was the Evening before he Suffered, juſt before <hi>Judas</hi> with his Black Guard came to Apprehend him; and when he did come, he found him in a praying Poſture; our Lord Teaching us by his Example, That when Eminent Dangers are before us, eſpecially when Death is apprehended by us, it is our Duty to be very much in Prayer to God, and very fervent in our Wreſtlings with him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Subject Matter of our Lord's Prayer, <hi>That, if poſſible, the Cup might paſs from him;</hi> That is, he might eſcape that Dreadful Wrath, at which he was ſo ſore amazed. But what! Did Chriſt now begin to repent of his Undertaking for Sinners? Did he ſhrink and give back when it came to the pinch? No, nothing like this; but as he had Two Natures, being GOD and Man, ſo he had two diſtinct Wills; as Man he feared and ſhunned Death; as God-man he willingly ſubmitted to it. The Divine Nature, and the Humane Spirit of Chriſt did now aſſault each other with diſagreeing Intereſts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, This Prayer was not abſolute, but Conditional; Father, if it may be, if thou wilt, if it pleaſe thee, let the Cup paſs, if not, I will drink it. The Cup of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we ſee is a very bitter and diſtaſtful Cup, a Cup which Humane Nature abhors; yet doth God oft-times put this Bitter Cup of Affliction into the hands of thoſe whom yet he does ſincerely Love; and when he doth do ſo, it is their Duty to drink it with Silence and Submiſſion, as here their Lord did before them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The manner of our Lord's Prayer in this his Agony; and here we may Remark (1.) It was a Solitary Prayer; he went by himſelf alone, out of the Hearing of his Diſciples. The Company of our beſt and deareſt Friends is not always Seaſonable; there are Times and Seaſons when a Chriſtian would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that the moſt intimate Friend he has in the World ſhould be with him, to hear what paſſes in Secret betwixt him and his God. Again (2.) it was an humble Prayer, that appears by the Poſtures in which he caſt himſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kneeling, ſometimes lying Proſtrate upon his Face; he lyes in the very Duſt, and lower he could not lye, and his Heart was as low as his Body. (3.) It was a vehement, fervent, and importunate Prayer; Such was the Fervour of his Spirit, that he Prayed himſelf into an Agony: Oh let us bluſh to think, how unlike our Praying-frame of Spirit is to Chriſt's. Lord! What Coldneſs, Deadneſs, Drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Formality and Lazineſs is found in our Prayers? how often do our Lips move when our Hearts ſtand ſtill. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Poſture which the Diſciples were found in, when our Lord was Praying in his Agony, they were faſt aſleep. Good God! Could they poſſibly ſleep at ſuch a time as this? When Chriſt's Soul was exceeding ſorrowful, could their Eyes be thus heavy? <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That the very beſt of Chriſt's Diſciples may be, and oft-times are, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with great Infirmities; when the moſt important Duties are performing; <hi>Then cometh he to his Diſciples, and find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Mild, Meek, and Gentle Rebuke which he gives his Diſciples for their Sleeping; he ſaid unto them, <hi>Why ſleep ye? could you not Watch with me one hour?</hi> What, not Watch when your Maſter was in ſuch Danger? Could you not Watch with me, when I am going to lay down my Life for you? What, not one hour, and that the parting Hour too? <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That
<pb facs="tcp:46556:119"/> the holieſt and beſt Reſolved Chriſtians, who have willing Spirits for Chriſt and his Service, yet in regard of the Weakneſs of the Fleſh, and frailty of Humane Nature, it is their Duty to Watch and Pray, and thereby Guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Temptations, <hi>Riſe and pray, leſt ye enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Lord! How ought the greateſt Profeſſors to look well to themſelves, and to the Grounds and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Profeſſion: For a Profeſſion begun in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, will certainly end in Apoſtacy. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The occaſion of the Treaſon, Covetouſneſs, or the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love of Worldly Wealth; and accordingly the Devil lays a Temptation before him, exactly ſuited to his Temper and Inclination, and it inſtantly over-came him. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Perſons are never in ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of falling into Sin, as when they meet with Temptations exactly ſuited to their Maſter Luſts. Oh pray we, That God would keep us from a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſuited to our predominant Luſt and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Treaſon of <hi>Judas, He led on</hi> an armed Multitude to the place where Chriſt was, gave them a ſignal to diſcover him by, and bids them <hi>lay hands upon him, and hold him faſt;</hi> Which Treaſon of <hi>Judas</hi> was attended with theſe black and helliſh Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. He had been a Witneſs of our Saviour's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, an Hearer of our Holy Lord's Doctrine; What he did was not by Sollicitation; the Chief Prieſts did not ſend to him, but <hi>he went to them.</hi> Lord! How dangerous is it, to allow our ſelves in any Secret Sin; none can ſay, how far that one Sin may in time lead us: Should any one have told <hi>Judas</hi> that his Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would at laſt make him deny his Maſter, and Sell his Saviour, he would have ſaid with <hi>Hazael, Is thy Servant a Dog that I ſhould do this thing? Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Endeavours uſed by the Diſciples for their Maſter's Reſcue, <hi>One of them</hi> (St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays it was <hi>Peter) drew a Sword, and cut off the Ear of Malchus;</hi> But why not the Ear of <hi>Judas</hi> rather? Becauſe, though <hi>Judas</hi> was moſt Faulty, yet <hi>Malchus</hi> might be moſt forward to Arreſt and carry off our Saviour. Oh how does a pious Breaſt boyl with Indignation at the ſight of any open Affront offered to its Saviour: Yet tho' St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heart was ſincere, his hand was too raſh; good Intentions are no warrant for irregular Actions; and accordingly Chriſt, who accepted the Affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Action: To reſiſt Authority, even in Chriſt's own Defence, is raſh Zeal, and diſcountenanced by the Goſpel. <hi>Peter</hi> did well to ask his Maſter, <hi>If he ſhould ſmite with the Sword;</hi> but he ought to have ſtayed his hand till Chriſt had given him his Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="54">54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the High-prieſts Houſe; and Peter followed afar off. 55 And when they had kindled a Fire in the midſt of the Hall, and were ſet down together, Peter ſate down amongſt them. 56 But a certain Maid beheld him as he ſate by the fire, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly looked upon him, and ſaid, This Man was alſo with him, 57 And he denied him, ſaying, Woman I know him not. 58 And after a little while, another ſaw him, and ſaid, Thou art alſo of them, And Peter ſaid, Man I am not. 59 And about the ſpace of an hour after, Another confidently affirmed, ſaying, Of a truth that fellow alſo was with him. 60 And Peter ſaid, Man, I know not what thou ſayeſt; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Cock Crew, while he yet ſpake. 61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter; And Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he ſaid unto him, before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>This Paragraph of the Chapter gives us an account of the Fall and Riſing of <hi>Peter;</hi> of his Sin in denying his Maſter, and of his Recovery by Repentance; both muſt be conſidered diſtinctly. Firſt, touching his Sin and Fall; there are Four Particulars <hi>Obſervable</hi> relating thereunto; namely, the Sin it ſelf, the Occaſion of that Sin, the Re-iteration and Repetition of it, and the aggravating Circumſtances attending it. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Sin it ſelf, the denyal of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: <hi>I know not the Man;</hi> and this back'd with an Oath, he Sware that he knew him not. Lord! How may the ſlaviſh fear of Suffering drive the Holieſt and beſt of Men to commit the fouleſt and the worſt of Sins. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Occaſions leading to this Sin, and they were theſe, Firſt, his <hi>Following of Chriſt afar off:</hi> To follow Chriſt was the Effect of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith, but to follow him afar off at this time, was the fruit of Fear, and the Effect of Frailty. Wo unto us when Temptation comes, if we be far from Chriſt's gracious Preſence and Aſſiſtance. (2.) His being in bad Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, amongſt Chriſt's Enemies: Would we eſcape Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Sin, we muſt then decline ſuch Company as would allure and draw us into Sin. <hi>Peter</hi> had better have been a cold by himſelf alone, then warming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a Fire which was Compaſſed in with the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Multitude; where his Conſcience, though not ſeared, was yet made hard. (3.) Another grand oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Falling, was a preſumptuous Confidence of his own Strength and Standing; <hi>Though all Men forſake thee, yet will not I.</hi> Oh Lord! to preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, is the ready way to provoke thee to leave us to our ſelves; if ever we ſtand in the day of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, 'tis the fear of Falling muſt enable us to ſtand; we ſoon Fall, if we believe it impoſſible to Fall. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Re-iteration and Repetition of this Sin, he denied Chriſt again and again; he denies him firſt with a Lye, then with an Oath, and next with a Curſe. Lord! How dangerous is it, not to reſiſt the firſt Beginnings of Sin? If we yield to one Temptation, Satan will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
<pb facs="tcp:46556:119"/> us with more and ſtronger; <hi>Peter</hi> proceeded from a Denyal to a Lye; from a Lye to an Oath, from an Oath to an Imprecation and Curſe; It is our Wiſdom vigorouſly to Reſiſt Sin at the Beginning; for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Character of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Diſciple, an Apoſtle, a chief Apoſtle, a ſpecial Favourite, who, with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had the ſpecial Honour to be with Chriſt at his Transfiguration; yet he denies Chriſt. (2.) The Perſon whom he denies, <hi>his Maſter,</hi> his Saviour and Redeemer, he that in great Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had waſhed <hi>Peter</hi>'s Feet, had eat the Paſſover with <hi>Peter,</hi> had given but juſt before the Holy Sacrament to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet is this kind and condeſcending Saviour denied by <hi>Peter.</hi> (3.) Conſider the Perſons before whom he denied Chriſt, the Chief Prieſts Servants. Oh how ſurprizing, and yet very pleaſing was it to them, to ſee one Diſciple Betray and Sell his Maſter, and another diſown and deny him. (4.) Conſider the Time when he denied him; it was but a few Hours after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Sacrament from Chriſt's own hands: how unreaſonable then is their Objection againſt coming to the Lord's Table, That ſome who go to it, diſhonour Chriſt: as ſoon as they come from it: Such Examples ought: not to diſcourage us from Coming to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but ſhould excite and encreaſe our Watchfulneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have been there; that our After-deportment may be ſuitable to the Solemnity of a Sacramental Table. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) What a ſmall Temptation he lay under, thus ſhamefully to deny his Lord and Maſter; a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel only at firſt ſpake to him; had a Band of Armed Soldiers appeared to him, and apprehended him: Had he been Bound and led away to the Judgment-Hall, and there Threatned with the Sentence of an ignominious Death, ſome Excuſe might have been made better for him; But to diſown his Relation to Chriſt upon a word ſpoken by a ſorry Maid that kept the door; the ſmallneſs of the Temptation was an high aggravation of the Crime. Ah <hi>Peter,</hi> How little didſt thou anſwer thy Name at this time? Thou art not now a Rock but a Reed, a Pillar blown down by a Womans Breath. Oh frail Humanity, whoſe Strength is Weakneſs and Infirmity. <hi>Note</hi> here, That in moſt of the Saints Falls Recorded in Scriptures, the firſt enticers to Sin, or the accidental occaſions of it, were Women; Witneſs (beſides the firſt Fall, that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s, where the Woman was firſt in the Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Fall of <hi>Lot, Samſon, David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> theſe are ſad inſtances of the Truth of what I ſpeak. A weak Creature may be a ſtrong Tempter; nothing is too impotent or uſeleſs for the Devil's Service; it was a great Aggravation of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sin, that the voice of a poor Maid that kept the door, ſhould be of more Force to over-come him, then his Faith in Jeſus to ſuſtain him. But what ſhall we ſay, ſmall things are ſufficient to caſt us down, if God doth not hold us up; we ſink under any Burthen, if God ſuſtains us not, and yield to the leaſt Temptation, if he leaves us to our ſelves; a Damſel ſhall then make a Diſciple ſhrink; and a Door-keeper ſhall be able to drive an Apoſtle before her. This is the Account in ſhort of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall, conſidered in it ſelf, and with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relating to it. Now follows his Recovery and Riſing again by Repentance; and here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> the Suddenneſs of his Repentance, the Means of his Repentance, and the Manner of his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) The Suddenneſs of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; as his Sin was ſad, ſo was his Repentance ſpeedy: Sins committed by Surprize, and through the prevalency of a Temptation that ſuddenly Aſſaults us, are much ſooner Repented of, then where the ſin is preſumptuous and deliberate; <hi>David</hi>'s Murther and Adultery were Deliberate Acts of Sin, in which he lay almoſt Twelve Months, without any Solemn Repentance for them. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denyal was haſty and ſudden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a violent pang and paſſion of Fear, and he takes the warning of the Cock's Crowing, to go forth ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and weep for his Tranſgreſſion. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Means of his Repentance, which was Two-fold; the leſs Principal-means, <hi>was the Crowing of the Cock,</hi> the more principal Means were <hi>Chriſt's looking upon Peter,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Remembring the word of Chriſt.</hi> (1.) The leſs principal Means of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Riſing and Recovery by Repentance, was <hi>the Crowing of the Cock;</hi> as the voice of the Maid occaſioned him to Sin, ſo the voice of the Cock occaſioned him to Reflect, That God who always can work without Means, can ever, when he pleaſe, work by weak and contemptible Means, and open the Mouth of a Bird or a Beaſt for the Converſion of a Man. But why doth our Lord make uſe of the Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cock, as a Means of bringing St. <hi>Peter</hi> to Repentance? There is ever ſome Myſtery in Chriſt's Inſtitutions and Inſtruments; The Cock was a Preacher to call St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his Duty, there being ſomething of Emblem between a Cock and a Preacher; The Preacher ought to have the Wings of the Cock, to rouze up himſelf from Drowſineſs and Security, and to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken others to a ſenſe of their Duty: He muſt have the Watchfulneſs of the Cock, to be ever ready to diſcover, and fore-warn Danger; He muſt have the voice of the Cock to cry aloud, to tell <hi>Iſrael</hi> of their Sin, to terrify the Roaring Lyon of Hell and make him Tremble, as they ſay the natural Lyon does; in a word, he muſt obſerve the Hours of the Cock, to Crow at all Seaſons; to Preach the Word in Seaſon and out of Seaſon. Again (2.) The more principal Means of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Recovery were, <hi>Chriſt's looking upon Peter, and Peter's remembring the word of Chriſt.</hi> (1.) <hi>Chriſt's looking upon Peter;</hi> our Saviour look'd upon <hi>Peter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either <hi>Peter</hi> look'd upon our Saviour, or upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Oh wonderful Act of Love and Grace towards this fallen Diſciple. Chriſt was now upon his Tryal for his Life (a time when our Thoughts would have been wholly taken up about our ſelves) but even then did Chriſt find Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to think upon <hi>Peter,</hi> to Remember his Diſconſolate Diſciple, to turn himſelf about, and give him a pittiful but piercing Look, even a Look that melted and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him into Tears; We never begin to lament our Sins, but we are firſt Lamented by our Saviour; <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, looked upon Peter,</hi> that was the firſt more principal Means of his Repentance. But (2.) the other Means was, <hi>Peter remembring of the word of the Lord, Before the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck Crow thou ſhalt deny me.</hi> Now this Remembrance was an Applicative and Feeling Remembrance; he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Prediction of Chriſt, and apply'd it ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to himſelf; Teaching us, That the efficacy of Chriſt's Word, in order to a ſound Repentance, depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hiſtorical Remembrance of it, but upon the cloſe Application thereof to every Man's Conſcience. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Manner of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance, it was Secret, it was Sincere, it was Laſting and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding. (1.) It was ſecret; <hi>He went out and wept, Verè dolet qui ſine Teſte dolet;</hi> He ſought a place of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where he might mourn in Secret: Solitarineſs is moſt agreeable to an afflicted Spirit; Yet muſt I add, that as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sorrow, ſo probably his Shame might cauſe him to go forth and weep. Chriſt looked upon him, and how aſhamed muſt he be to look upon Chriſt, ſeeing he had ſo lately denied that he had ever ſeen him. (2.) St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance was Sincere, <hi>He wept bitterly;</hi> His Grief was extraordinary, and his Tears abundant; There is always a weeping that muſt follow Sin; Sin muſt coſt the Soul Sorrow, either here or in Hell; We muſt now either Mourn a while, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ever. Doubtleſs with <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tears there was joined hearty Confeſſion of Sin to God, and ſmart Reflections upon himſelf after this manner; Lord! What have I done? I a Diſciple, I an Apoſtle, I that did ſo lately acknowledge my Maſter to be Chriſt the Lord; I that ſpoke with ſo much Aſſurance, <hi>Though all Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thee, yet will not I;</hi> I that promiſed to lay down my Life for his ſake, yet have I denied him, yet have I with Oaths and Imprecations Diſowned him, and this at the Voice of a Damſel, not at the ſight of a Drawn Sword preſented at my Breaſt. Lord! What weakneſs? what wickedneſs, what unfaithfulneſs have I been guilty of? Oh that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep all my days
<pb facs="tcp:46556:120"/> for the Fault of this one Night. Thus may we ſuppoſe our Lapſed Apoſtle to have bemoaned himſelf: And happy was it for him that he did ſo, for Bleſſed are the Tears of a Converted Revolter, and happy is the Miſery of a Mourning Offender. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance was not only Secret and Sincere, but Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Abiding; He retained a very quick Senſe, and lively Remembrance of this Sin upon his Mind all his Life after. <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> Reports, that ever after when St. <hi>Peter</hi> heard the Crowing of the Cock, he fell upon his Knees and wept: Others ſay, That he was wont to riſe at Mid-night, and ſpend the Time in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Humiliation, between Cock-Crowing and Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: And the Papiſts who delight to turn every thing into Folly and Superſtition, firſt began that Practice of ſetting up what we call Weather-Cocks upon Towers and Steeples, to put People in mind of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall and Repentance by that Signal. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance was attended with an extraordinary Zeal and Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Service of Chriſt, to the end of his Days. He had a burning Love towards the Holy Jeſus ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is now improved into a Seraphick Flame; <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> ſays himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 21.17. And as an Evidence of it, he fed Chriſt's Sheep; For in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles we read of his Extraordinary Diligence to ſpread the Goſpel, and his Travels in order thereunto are Computed by ſome to be Nine hundred and Fifty Miles. To end all, have any of us fallen with <hi>Peter;</hi> though not with a formal Abjuration, yet by a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal denying of him, let us go forth and weep with him, let us be more vigilant and watchful over our ſelves for the time to come, let us expreſs more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Love and Zeal for Chriſt, more diligence in his Service, more Concernedneſs for his Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: This would be an Happy Improvement of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; God grant it may have that Bleſſed Effect.</p>
               <p n="63">63 And the Men that held Jeſus mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and ſmote him. 64 And when they had Blind-folded him, they ſtroke him on the Face, and asked him, ſaying, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy who he is that ſmote thee. 65 And many other things blaſphemouſly ſpake they againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, The vile Affronts, the horrid Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Injuries and Indignities which were put upon the Holy and Innocent Jeſus, in the day of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; the rude Officers and Servants ſpit in his Face, Blind-fold his Eyes, ſmite him with their Hands, and in Contempt and Scorn, bid him <hi>Prophecy, who it was that ſmote him.</hi> Verily, There is no degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, no mark of Shame, no kind of Suffering, which we ought to Decline for Chriſt's ſake, who hid not his Face from Shame and Spitting upon our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="66">66 And as ſoon as it was day, the Elders of the people, and the Chief Prieſts, and Scribes came together, and led him into their Council. 67 Saying, Art thou the Chriſt?

And he ſaid unto them, Ye ſay that I am. 71 And they ſaid, What need we any far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Witneſs? for we our ſelves have heard of his own Mouth.</p>
               <p>Our Lord is now Arraigned by the Chief Prieſts, and <hi>Obſerve</hi> the Indictment of Blaſphemy is brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; <hi>What need we any farther Witneſs? we have heard his Blaſphemy.</hi> Abominable Wickedneſs! It is not in the Power of Innocency it ſelf; nay, not in the Power of the greateſt and unſpotted Innocency, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect from Slander and falſe Accuſation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, The great Meekneſs of our Saviour under all theſe ill Suggeſtions, and falſe Accuſations, as a Lamb before the Shearer, ſo is he Dumb, and opened not his Mouth. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That to bear the Revilings, Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and falſe Accuſations of Men, with a Silent and Submiſſive Spirit, is an excellent and Chriſt-like Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Though a Tryal for his Innocent Life was now Managed moſt Maliciouſly and Illegally againſt him; yet <hi>When he was Reviled, Reviled not again, when he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he Threatned not:</hi> Oh may the ſame Meek and Humble Mind be in us which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, who inſtead of Reviling his Accuſers, Prayed for his Murtherers, and Offered up his Blood to God on the Behalf of them that ſhed it.

               <p>In this Chapter we have a Relation of the Black and Saddeſt Tragedy that ever was Acted upon the Stage of the World, Namely, the Barbarous and Bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Holy and Innocent Jeſus, by the Jews his
<pb facs="tcp:46556:120"/> own Country-Men; the Beſt of Kings put to Death by his own Subjects. And the firſt ſtep towards it is his Arraignment before <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod;</hi> they Poſt him from one to another; <hi>Pilate</hi> ſends him to <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> having made ſufficient Sport with him, Remands him to <hi>Pilate:</hi> Neither of them find any Fault in him worthy of Death, yet neither of them would Releaſe him. Here <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That our Saviour being before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> Anſwers him Readily and Cautiouſly, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> ſays <hi>Pilate; Thou ſayeſt it,</hi> ſays our Saviour. <hi>Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi> He Replied, <hi>I am.</hi> Hence ſays the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good Confeſſion. Teaching</hi> us, That though we may, and ſometimes ought to hold our Peace when our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is Concerned; yet muſt we never be Silent, when the Honour of God and his Truth may be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually promoted, by a Free and a Full Confeſſion; yet is it farther <hi>Obſervable,</hi> That our Saviour being before <hi>Herod,</hi> would neither Anſwer him to any Queſtion, nor Work any Miracle before him. This was an Inſtance and Evidence of our Lord's great Humility in refuſing to Work Miracles before <hi>Herod,</hi> who deſired it only to gratify his Curioſity. Thus do vile Men abuſe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power of God, deſiring to ſee it exerted for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Paſtime; not to be Convinced, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by it. And as Admirable was the Patience, as the Humility of Chriſt, and his preſent Silence, who neither at <hi>Herod</hi>'s Requeſt, nor at the <hi>Jews</hi> Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and falſe Accuſations, could be moved to Anſwer any thing. <hi>Obſerve</hi> Laſtly, That though <hi>Herod</hi> had Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Chriſt's Fore-runner, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's own Life was in danger by <hi>Herod</hi> heretofore, yet now he had him in his Hands, he lets him go; only he firſt abuſes him, and mocks him, and Arrays him in a Gorgeous Robe, like a Mock King. Thus were all the Marks of Scorn imaginable put upon our Dear Redeemer; yet all this Jearing and ſportful Shame did our Lord undergo, to ſhew what was due unto us for our Sins; and alſo to give us an Example to bear all the Shame and Reproach imaginable for his ſake; <hi>Who for the Joy that was ſet before him, deſpiſed the Shame, Hebr.</hi> 12.2.</p>

What Evil hath he done? I have found no Cauſe of Death in him; I will therefore Chaſtiſe him, and let him go. 23 And they were inſtant with loud Voices, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that he might be Crucified: And the voices of them, and of the Chief Prieſts prevailed. 24 And Pilate gave Sentence that it ſhould be as they Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 25 And he Releaſed unto them, him that for Sedition and Murder was caſt into Priſon, whom they had deſired; But he delivered Jeſus to their Will.</p>

                  </gap> Chriſt met with from <hi>Pilate</hi> an Heathen, then from the Chief Prieſts, and People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> profeſſing the true Religion. Oh how deſperate is the Hatred that grows upon the Root of Religion. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites within the Church may be guilty of ſuch Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Acts of Wickedneſs, as the Conſciences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Pagans without the Church may Boggle at, and Proteſt againſt. <hi>Pilate</hi> a Pagan Abſolves Chriſt, whilſt the Hypocritical Jews that heard his Doctrine, and ſaw his Miracles, do condemn him. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) How <hi>Pilate</hi> at laſt ſuffers himſelf to be over-come, with the Importunity of the Jews, and delivers the Holy and Innocent Jeſus, contrary to his Judgment and Conſcience, to the Will of his Murtherers. It is a vain Apology for Sin, when Perſons pretend that they are not committed with their own Conſent; but at the Inſtigation and Importunity of others: For ſuch is the Frame and Conſtitution of Man's Soul, that none can make a Perſon wicked without his own Conſent; It was no Extenuation of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Sin, no Alleviation of his Puniſhment, that to pleaſe the People he delivered up our Saviour, contrary to the Direction of his own Conſcience, to be Crucified. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.)

But whence ſprang the Malice and Hatred of the High Prieſts, and People of the Jews againſt our Saviour? Why plainly from hence, Chriſt Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law of God more ſtrictly than their Luſts could bear; and he lived a more Holy, Uſeful, and Excellent Life than they could endure. Now nothing enrages the Men of the World more againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, but eſpecially the Preachers of the Goſpel, then Holineſs of Doctrine and Strictneſs of Life and Converſation. Such as Preach, and Live well, let them expect ſuch Enmity and Oppoſition, ſuch Malice and Perſecution, ſuch Sufferings and Tryals as will ſhock an ordinary Patience and Conſtancy of Mind.

It is very probable, That the Tears and Lamentations of many of theſe Mourners, were but the fruits of tender Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not the Effects of Faith, and flowing from a Principle of Grace. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That melting Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Sorrows, even from the Senſe of Chriſt's Sufferings, are no infallible Marks of Grace. The Hiſtory of Chriſt's Sufferings is very Tragical and Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and may melt ingenuous Nature, where there is no Renewed Principle of Grace.</p>

               <p>Here we ſee the Infamous Company that our holy Lord Suffered with; <hi>Two Thieves:</hi> It had been a ſufficient Diſparagement to our Bleſſed Saviour, to be Sorted with the beſt of Men; But to be numbered with the Scum of Mankind, is ſuch an Indignity as Confounds our Thoughts: This was deſigned by the <hi>Jews</hi> to diſhonour and diſgrace our Saviour the more; and to perſwade the World, that he was the greateſt of Offenders: But God over ruled this, for Fulfilling an Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy concerning the Meſſiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. laſt, <hi>and he was Numbered with the Tranſgreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34 Then ſaid Jeſus, Father, Forgive them, for they know not what they do.</p>
               <p>Chriſt had often Preach'd the Doctrine of Forgiving Enemies, and Praying for them, he Practiſes it here himſelf in a moſt Exemplary manner. Where <hi>Note,</hi> (1.) The Mercy deſired and Prayed for, and that is, <hi>Forgiveneſs.</hi> (2.) The Perſon deſiring that Mercy, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Dying Jeſus. (3.) The Perſons for whom it is Deſired, his Bloody Murtherers; <hi>Father, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them.</hi> (4.) The Argument uſed, or Motive ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to procure the Mercy; Forgive them, <hi>For they know not what they do. Learn</hi> hence, (1.) That Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the uſual Cauſe of Enmity againſt Chriſt. (2.) That there is Forgiveneſs with God for ſuch as oppoſe, yea Perſecute Chriſt out of Ignorance. (3.) That to Forgive Enemies, and to beg Forgiveneſs for them, is an Evidence of a Chriſt-like Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <hi>Father, Forgive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35 And the People ſtood beholding, and the Rulers alſo with them derided him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He ſaved others, let him ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he be Chriſt the choſen of God. 36 And the Soldiers alſo mocked him, coming to him, and offering him Vinegar. 37 And ſaying, If thou be the King of the Jews, ſave thy ſelf. 38 And a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was written over him in Hebrew, in Greek, and Latin; This is the King of the Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) A mighty Aggravation of our Lord's Sufferings upon the Croſs, Namely, The mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deriſion which he met with in his Dying Moments. As he endured the Pain, ſo he deſpiſed the Shame: Cruel Mockings was our Lord Tryed with, both from the Common People, and from the Chief Prieſts; yet the Common People's Reviling him, and wagging their Heads at him, was not ſo much to be taken Notice of, as the Chief Prieſts, who were Men of Age and Gravity, and the Miniſters of Religion; For them Barbarouſly to Mock him in his Miſery, and which was worſe, Atheiſtically to Jear and Scoff at his Faith and Affiance in God; Saying, <hi>He truſted in God that he would deliver him, let him deliver him if he will have him.</hi> This was ſuch an Indignity as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds our Thoughts. But from hence we <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That Perſecutors are generally Atheiſtical Scoffers; the Chief Prieſts and Elders who Perſecuted Chriſt, do Blaſpheme God; they mock at his Power, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride his Providence, which was as wicked as to deny his Being. (2.) We <hi>Learn</hi> from this Example, That ſuch as Miniſter to God in Holy things, by way of Office, if they be not the Beſt, they are generally the worſt of Men; no ſuch bitter Enemies to the Power of Godlineſs, as ſuch Preachers, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Experimentally Acquainted with the Efficacy and Power of it, upon their own Hearts and Lives. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (2.) The Inſcription wrote by <hi>Pilate</hi> over our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saviour, <hi>This is Jeſus, the King of the Jews.</hi> It was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Malefactor, to publiſh the Cauſe of his Death, in Capital Letters placed over the Head of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now it is <hi>Obſervable</hi> how wonderfully the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God over-ruled the Heart and Pen of <hi>Pilate,</hi> to draw this Title, which was truly Honourable, and fix it to his Croſs. <hi>Pilate</hi> is Chriſt's Herald, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims him <hi>King of the Jews. Learn</hi> hence, That the Kingſhip and Regal Dignity of Chriſt was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Enemy, and that in a time of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sufferings and Reproaches. <hi>Pilate</hi> without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did our Saviour an eminent piece of Service; Verily he did that for Chriſt, which none of his own Diſciples durſt do; not that he did it deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and with any intent to put Honour upon Chriſt, but from the ſpecial over-ruling Providence of God: No thanks to <hi>Pilate</hi> for all this, Becauſe the Higheſt Services performed to Chriſt undeſignedly ſhall never be Accepted nor Rewarded by him.</p>
               <p n="39">39 And one of the Malefactors which were hanged, Railed on him, ſaying, If Thou be Chriſt, Save thy ſelf and us. 40 But the other Anſwering, Rebuked him,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:121"/> ſaying, Doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame Condemnation? 41 And we indeed juſtly; For we receive the due Reward of our Deeds. But this Man hath done nothing amiſs. 42 And he ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, Remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Here we have a farther Aggravation of our Lord's Sufferings upon the Croſs, from the Company he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with, the Two Thieves who Reviled him with the reſt. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark</hi> ſay, They both Reviled him, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſays One of them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled; poſſibly both of them might do it at firſt, and one of them Repent, which if ſo, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the wonder of the Penitent Thiefs Converſion: From the Impenitent Thiefs Reviling of Chriſt, when he was at the very point of Death, and even in the Suburbs of Hell, we <hi>Learn,</hi> That neither Shame nor Pain, will change the Mind of a Reſolute Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but even then, when he is in the Suburbs of Hell will he Blaſpheme. From the Penitent Thief's Confeſſing of Chriſt, and Praying to him, <hi>Lord, Remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom;</hi> We <hi>Learn,</hi> Both the Efficacy and Freeneſs of Divine Grace. (1.) The efficacious Power of it: Oh how Powerful muſt tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Grace be, which wrought ſuch a Change in an inſtant, which ſupplied that Heart in a Moment, which had been hardning in Sin for ſo many Years. (2.) The Freeneſs of it; which takes hold of his Heart, when he was at the height of Sin, and was not only void of Grace, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſt Grace. Oh the powerful Efficacy, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Freeneſs of the Heart-changing Grace of God in this vile Perſon; it diſpoſed him to own his Sin, to confeſs the juſtneſs of his Puniſhment, to juſtify Chriſt's Innocency, to Reprove his Fellow-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, to pray to a Crucified Chriſt, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with him, not for preſent Deliverance from Death, but for a place in Chriſt's Kingdom. Where we <hi>Learn,</hi> (1.) That true Converſion is never too late for obtaining Mercy and Salvation. (2.) That True Converſion, how late ſoever, will have its Fruits: The Fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Fruits of Faith and Repentance, were found with this penitent Thief; yet muſt not this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Caſe be drawn into Example: This Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and Miraculous Grace of God is not to be expected ordinarily; We have no warrant to expect an over-powering degree of God's Grace, to turn our Hearts in an inſtant at the Hour of Death, when we have Lived in Forgetfulneſs of God, and in a Supine neglect of our Soul's Concerns all the days of our Life: For it is evident, as to this Caſe of the Penitent Thief's Converſion at the laſt Hour, (1.) It is an Example without a Promiſe; (2.) It is but a ſingle Example; (3.) It is an Example Recorded but by one Evangeliſt, the Spirit of God fore-ſeeing what an ill uſe ſome would make of this Inſtance, leaves one Example upon Record, that none might deſpair, and but one, that none might Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. (4.) This Thief probably never had any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt before. (5.) This was a Miracle with the Glory whereof Chriſt would Honour the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy of his Croſs. So that we have no more ground to expect ſuch another Converſion, then we have to expect a Second Crucifixion. This Converted Perſon was the firſt Fruits of the Blood of the Croſs. From whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> That God can, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth, though very ſeldom, prepare Men for Glory, immediately before their Diſſolution by Death.</p>
               <p n="43">43 And Jeſus ſaid unto him, verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, To Day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words are our Saviour's Gracious Anſwer to the Penitent Thief's Humble Prayer, <hi>Lord, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me in thy Kingdom,</hi> ſays the Thief, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in my Kingdom;</hi> ſays our Saviour: Where <hi>Note</hi> (1.) The Immortality of the Souls of Men is without all doubt: Our deſires after, and hopes for Immortality, do prove our Souls Immortal, and capable of that State. (2.) That there is a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eternal State into which Souls paſs at Death. Death is our paſſage out of the ſwift River of Time, into the Boundleſs and Bottomleſs Ocean of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. (3.) That the Souls of all the Righteous at Death, are immediately Received into a State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Glory; <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me;</hi> not after thy Reſurrection, but immediately after thy Diſſolution. That Man's Soul is aſleep, or worſe, that Dreams of the Soul's ſleeping till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For why ſhould the Believers Happineſs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, when they are immediately capable of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it? Why ſhould their Salvation ſlumber, when the Wicked's Damnation ſlumbereth not? How do ſuch delays conſiſt with Chriſt's ardent Deſires, and his Peoples vehement Longings to be together.</p>
               <p n="44">44 And it was about the ſixth Hour, and there was a Darkneſs over all the Earth until the Ninth Hour. 45 And the Sun was Darkned, and the Veil of the Temple was Rent in the midſt. 46 And when Jeſus had cryed with a loud Voice, he ſaid, Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit: And having ſaid thus, he gave up the Ghoſt. 47 Now when the Centurion ſaw what was done, he Glorified God; ſaying, Certainly this was a Righteous Man. 48 And all the People that came together to that ſight, beholding the things which were done, ſmote their Breaſts and Returned. 49 And all his Acquaintance, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that followed him from Galilee, ſtood afar off beholding theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, (1.) What Prodigies in Nature hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and fell out at the Crucifixion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; The Sun was Darkened, at the Setting of the Son of Righteouſneſs; And the Veil of the Temple was Rent, ſignifying, That God was now about to Forſake his Temple, that the Ceremonial Law was now Aboliſhing, and the Partition-Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Jew and Gentile, being now pulled down, all may have Acceſs to God, through the Blood of a Mediator. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The laſt Prayer of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, before his Death, <hi>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit:</hi> They are words full of Faith and Comfort, fit to be the laſt Breathings of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gracious Soul in this World. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Dying Believers are both Warranted and Encouraged by Chriſt's Example, Believingly to Commend their precious Souls into the Hands of God, as a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father; <hi>Father into thy Hands. Obſerve</hi> (3.) What influence our Saviour's Death had upon the Centurion, <hi>He Glorified God, ſaying, Verily this was a Righteous Man.</hi> Here <hi>Note,</hi> That Chriſt had a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Innocency and Righteouſneſs given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from all ſorts of Perſons whatſoever; <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> pronounced him <hi>Innocent; Pilate</hi>'s Wife proclaimed him <hi>a Righteous Perſon; Judas</hi> the Traitor declared <hi>it was innocent Blood;</hi> the Thief on the Croſs affirmed, he had <hi>done nothing amiſs;</hi> and the Centurion owned him <hi>to be a Righteous Man;</hi> yea,

               <p n="50">50 And behold there was a Man Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Joſeph, a Counſellor, and he was a good Man, and a juſt. 51 (The ſame had not conſented to the Counſel and Deed of them) he was of Arimathea, a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Jews; who alſo himſelf wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for rhe Kingdom of God. 52 This Man went unto Pilate, and begged the Body of Jeſus. 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in Linnen, and laid it in a Sepulchre, that was hewn in Stone, wherein never Man before was laid, 54 And that Day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on. 55 And the Women alſo which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the Sepulchre, and how his Body was laid. 56 And they Returned and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Spices and Oyntments; and reſted the Sabbath-day, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances of our Lord's Funeral, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Interrment are here Recorded by our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt; ſuch a Funeral as never was, ſince Graves were firſt Digg'd. Where <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) Our Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt be Begg'd before it could be Bury'd; The Dead Bodies of Malefactors being in the Power, and at the Diſpoſal of the Judge that Condemns them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (2.) The Perſon that Begg'd this Body, and beſtowed a Decent and Honourable Buryal upon it, <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> a worthy, though a cloſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Grace doth not always make a publick and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Shew where it is: But as there is much ſecret Riches in the Bowels of the Earth, though unſeen; ſo is there much Grace in the Hearts of ſome Saints, which the World takes little Notice of. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) The Mourners that followed our Saviour's Hearſe to the Grave; The Women which came out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> a poor Train of Mourners; The Apoſtles who ſhould have been moſt officious to bear his Holy Body to the Ground, were ſometime ſince all Scattered, afraid to own their Maſter, either Dying, or Dead. Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pomo had been no way ſuitable, either to the End or Manner of our Lord's Death, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here is is nothing like. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (4.) The Grave or Sepulchre in which our Holy Lord lay; it was in a Sepulchre <hi>Hewn out of a Rock;</hi> That ſo his Enemies might have no occaſion to ſay, that his Diſciples ſtole him away by ſecret Holes, and unſeen Paſſages under Ground; It was in a New Sepulchre, <hi>Wherein never Man was laid before,</hi> leſt his Adverſaries ſhould ſay, it was another that was Riſen, who was Bury'd there before him: And has Buryed in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. As by the Sin of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Garden of Pleaſure, the Earthly Paradiſe, ſo by the Sufferings of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who lay Buryed in a Garden, we may hope for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Heavenly Paradiſe. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (5.) The manner of our Lord's Funeral, it was Haſty, Open and Decent. Haſty, becauſe of the Preparation for the Sabbath; Open, that all Perſons might be Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, and none might ſay, He was Buryed before he was Dead. Decent, being wrapt in fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and Perfumed with Spices. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (6.) The Reaſons why our Lord was thus Buryed; Seeing he was to Riſe again in as ſhort a Time as other Men lye by the Walls, doubtleſs it was to declare the Certainty of his Death, to Fulfil the Types and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which went before of him, <hi>As Jonas being Three days and three nights in the Whales Belly;</hi> He was alſo Bury'd to Compleat his Humiliation; This was the loweſt ſtep to which he could Deſcend in his Abaſed State. In a word, Chriſt went into the Grave, that he might Conquer Death in its own Territories and Dominions. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (7.) Of what Uſe our Lord's Buryal is to us his Followers; it ſhews us the amazing Depths of his Humiliation, from what, and to what his Love brought him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the Boſom of his Father, to the Boſom of the Grave. It may Comfort us againſt the fears of Death, and the Terrors of the Grave: The Grave could not long keep Chriſt, it ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep Chriſtians: It was a Loathſome Priſon before, it is a Perſumed Bed now: He whoſe Head is in Heaven, need not fear to put his Feet into the Grave. Awake and Sing, thou that dwelleſt in the Duſt, for the Enmity of the Grave is ſlain by Chriſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> This Laſt Chapter of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, contains the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Reſurrection, and gives us an Account of what he did upon Earth, between the Time of his glorious Reſurrection and Triumphant Aſcenſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 NOW upon the firſt day of the Week, very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they came unto the Sepulchre; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. 2 And they found the Stone Rolled away from Sepulchre. 3 And they entered in, and found not the Body of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. 4 And it came to paſs as they were much perplexed thereabout; Behold Two Men ſtood by them, in ſhining Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their Faces to the Earth, they ſaid unto them, Why ſeek ye the Living among the Dead? 6 He is not here, but is Riſen: Remember how he ſpake unto you, when he was yet in Galilee. 7 Saying, The Son of Man muſt be delivered into the Hands of Sinful Men, and be Crucified, and the Third day Riſe Again. 8 And they Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his Words. 9 And Returned from the Sepulchre, and told all theſe things unto the Apoſtles, and to all the Reſt. 10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and Mary the Mother of James, and other Women that were with them which told theſe things unto the Apoſtles. 11 And their words ſeemed to them as Idle
<pb facs="tcp:46556:122"/> Tales, and they believed them not. 12 Then aroſe Peter and ran unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and ſtooping down, he beheld the Linnen Cloaths laid by themſelves, and departed, wondering in himſelf at that which was come to paſs.</p>
               <p>The Lord of Life, who was put to Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Fryday,</hi> was Buryed in the Evening of the ſame Day; and his Holy Body Reſted in the ſilent Grave, all the next Day, being the Jewiſh Sabbath, and ſome part of the Morning Following. Thus Roſe he again the Third Day, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, neither ſooner nor later; Not ſooner, leſt the Truth of his Death ſhould have been queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he did not Dye at all; not later, leſt the Faith of his Diſciples ſhould have failed: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, when the Sabbath was paſt, <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> getting the other Women together, ſhe and they ſet out very early in the Morning, to Viſit the Holy Sepulchre, and about Sun-riſing they get to it, intending with their Spices and Odours farther to Embalm their Lord's Body. <hi>Obſerve</hi> here (1.) That although the Hearts of theſe Holy Women did burn with an Ardent Zeal and Affection to their Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord; Yet the Commanded Duties of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath are not omitted by them; they keep cloſe, and ſilently ſpend that Holy Day in a Mixture of Grief and Hope; A good Pattern of Sabbath-Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and worthy of our Chriſtian Imitation. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (2.) Theſe Holy Women go, but not empty-handed: She that had beſtowed a coſtly Alablaſter upon Chriſt, whilſt alive, prepares no leſs Precious Odours for him now Dead; thereby paying their laſt Homage to our Saviour's Corpſe. But what need of Odours to perfume a precious Body which could not ſee Corruption? True, his Holy Body did not want them, but the Love and Affection of his Friends could not withhold them. <hi>Obſerve</hi> (3.) How great a Tribute of Reſpect and Honour is due and payable to the Memory of theſe Holy Women, for their great Magnanimity and Courage: They followed Chriſt when his Cowardly Diſciples left him; they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to his Croſs, they attended his Herſe to the Grave, when his Diſciples did not, durſt not appear; And now very early in the Morning they Viſit his Sepulchre, Fearing neither the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Night, nor the Preſence of the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though a Band of rude Soldiers. <hi>Learn</hi> hence, That Courage and Reſolution is the ſpecial Gift of God; if he gives it to the feebler Sex, even to timerous and fearful Women, it ſhall not be in the power of Armed Men to make them afraid. But to come to a cloſe Conſideration of the ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relating to the Reſurrection of our Holy Lord. <hi>Note</hi> (1.) With what Pomp and Triumph our Holy Lord Ariſes; Two Men, that is, Two Angels in the Shape of Men, <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>are ſent from Heaven to roll away the Stone.</hi> But could not Chriſt have Riſen then without the Angels help? Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; he that Raiſed himſelf, could eaſily have Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away the Stone himſelf; But God thinks fit to ſend an Officer from Heaven, to open the Priſon-door of the Grave; and by ſetting our Surety at Liberty, proclaims our Debt to the Divine Juſtice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>y Satisfied. Beſides it was fit that the Angels who had been Witneſſes of our Saviour's Paſſion, ſhould alſo be Witneſſes of his Reſurrection. <hi>Note</hi> (2.) our Lord's Reſurrection declared, <hi>He is Riſen, he is not here.</hi> Almighty God never intended, that the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Soul ſhould be left in an obſcure Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; <hi>He is not here,</hi> ſaid the Angels, where you laid him, where you left him; Death has loſt its Prey, and the Grave has loſt its Priſoner. <hi>Note</hi> (3.) It is is not ſaid, <hi>He is not here,</hi> for he is Raiſed, but <hi>he is Riſen, V.</hi> 6. The Original Word imports, the Active Power of Chriſt, or the Self-quickning Principle by which Chriſt Raiſed himſelf from the Dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. <hi>He ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion.</hi> Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That it was the Divine Nature, or God-head of Chriſt, which Raiſed the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Death to Life, others were Raiſed from the Grave by Chriſt's Power, but he Raiſed himſelf by his own Power. <hi>Note</hi> (4.) The Perſons to whom our Lord's Reſurrection was firſt declared and made known, to Women, to the two <hi>Mary's:</hi> But why to Women? and why to theſe Women? To Women firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſometimes makes choice of weak Means, for producing great Effects; knowing, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Inſtrument Redounds to the greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Agent: In the whole Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, God intermixes Divine Power with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Weakneſs: Thus the Conception of Chriſt was by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, but his Mother a poor Woman, a Carpenter's Spouſe; So the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of Chriſt was in much Meanneſs and outward Baſeneſs, being Crucified between two Thieves; But the Powers of Heaven and Earth Trembling, the Rocks Rending, the Graves opening, ſhewed a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Divine Power. Thus here, God Selects Women, to declare that he will Honour what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he pleaſes, for the Accompliſhment of his own Purpoſes. But why to theſe Women, the two <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's,</hi> is the firſt Diſcovery made of our Lord's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection? Poſſibly it was a Reward for their Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity and Maſculine Courage. Theſe Women cleave to Chriſt, when the Apoſtles forſook him: They Aſſiſted at his Croſs, they Attended at his Funeral, they Waited at his Sepulchre; Theſe Women had more Courage than the Apoſtles, therefore God makes them Apoſtles to the Apoſtles. This was a Tacit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, a Secret Check given to the Apoſtles, that they ſhould be thus out-done by Women: Theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Women went before the Apoſtles in the laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that were done for Chriſt; and therefore the Apoſtles here come after them in their Rewards and Comforts. <hi>Note</hi> (5.) The quick Meſſage which theſe Holy Women carry to the Diſconſolate Diſciples, of the Joyful news of our Saviour's Reſurrection; They Returned from the Sepulchre, and told all theſe things to the Eleven, <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. And the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts ſay, That they were ſent and bidden to go to the Apoſtles with the Notices of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Go tell the Diſciples,</hi> ſays the Angel, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.7. <hi>Go tell my Brethren,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. A moſt endearing Expreſſion; Chriſt might have ſaid, Go tell my Apoſtate Apoſtles, my Cowardly Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that left me in my Danger, that durſt not own me in the High Prieſt's Hall, that durſt not come within the Shadow of my Croſs, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of my Sepulchre. But not one Word of all this, by way of upbraiding them for their late ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cowardice, but all words of Divine Indulgence, and of endearing Kindneſs, <hi>Go tell my Brethren:</hi> Where <hi>Mark,</hi> that Chriſt calls them Brethren after his Reſurrection and Exaltation, thereby ſhewing, that the Change of his Condition, had wrought no Change in his Affection towards his poor Diſciples; But thoſe that were his Brethren before, in the Time of his Humiliation and Abaſement, are ſo ſtill, after his Exaltation and Advancement; <hi>Go tell my Brethren.</hi> One thing more muſt be Noted with Reference to our Lord's Reſurrection, and that is, Why he did not firſt chooſe to appear to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> his Diſconſolate Mother, whoſe Soul was pierced with a quick and lively ſight and Senſe of her Son's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? But to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> who had been a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sinner? Doubtleſs this was for the Comfort of all true Penitents, and Adminiſters great Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them; As the Angels in Heaven Rejoyce, much more doth Chriſt Joy in the Recovery of one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinner, then in Multitudes of Holy and Juſt Perſons (ſuch was the Bleſſed Virgin) who need
<pb facs="tcp:46556:123"/> no Repentance: For the ſame Reaſon did our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our particularly Name <hi>Peter, Go tell my Diſciples, and Peter;</hi> He being for his Denyal of Chriſt, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with Sorrow, and ſtanding moſt in need of Conſolation; therefore ſpeak particularly to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, Be ſure that his ſad Heart be Comforted with this joyful News, that I am Riſen; and let him know, that I am Friends with him, notwithſtanding his late Cowardice.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And behold two of them went the ſame day to a Village called Emmaus, which was from Jeruſalem about Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Furlongs. 14 And they talked together of all thoſe things which had happened. 15 And it came to paſs, that while they Communed together, and reaſoned, Jeſus himſelf drew near and went with them. 16 But their Eyes were holden, that they ſhould not know him. 17 And he ſaid unto them, What manner of Communications are theſe, that ye have one to another as ye walk, and are ſad? 18 And one of them, whoſe Name was Cleopas, anſwering ſaid unto him, Art thou only a Stranger in Iſrael, and haſt not known the things which are come to paſs there in theſe Days? 19 And he ſaid unto them, What things? And they ſaid unto him, Concerning Jeſus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet mighty in Deed and Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and all the People. 20 And how the Chief Prieſts and our Rulers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him to be Condemned to Death, and have Crucified him. 21 But we truſted that it had been he which ſhould have Redeemed Iſrael; and beſides all this, To Day is the Third Day ſince theſe things were done. 22 Yea, and certain Women of our Company made us Aſtoniſhed, which were early at the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. 23 And when they found not his Body, they came, ſaying, That they had alſo ſeen a Viſion of Angels, which ſaid that he was Alive. 24 And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of them which were with us, went to the Sepulchre, and found it even ſo as the Women had ſaid, but him they ſaw not.</p>
               <p>Here we have <hi>Obſervable,</hi> (1.) The Journey which Two of the Diſciples took to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> a Village not far from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> The Occaſion of their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is not told us, but the Scripture Acquaints us with their Diſcourſe in their Journey, and as they were walking by the way: It was Holy and Uſeful, Pious and Profitable Diſcourſe that they entertained one another with as they walk'd; They Diſcours'd of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, a good Pattern for our Imitation, when Providentially caſt into ſuch Company as will bear it; <hi>That our Lips drop as the Honey-comb,</hi> and <hi>our Tongue be as choice Silver. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (2.) How our Holy Lord preſently made one in the Company, when they were Diſcourſing Seriouſly about the Matters of Religion; he over-took them, and joined himſelf to them: The way to have Chriſt's Preſence and Company with us, is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of Chriſt, and the things of Chriſt. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (3.) Tho' Chriſt came to them, it was <hi>Incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito;</hi> he was not known to them, for their Eyes were holden by the Power of God, their Sight was reſtrained, that they could not Diſcern who he was, but took him for another Perſon, though his Body had the ſame Dimenſions that it had before. Whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> The Influence which God has upon all our Powers and Faculties, upon all our Members and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and how much we depend upon God for the Uſe and Exerciſe of our Faculties and Members; <hi>Their Eyes were holden that they could not ſee him. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> (4.) That the Notion of the Meſſias being a Temporal Saviour, was ſo deeply Rooted in the minds of the Diſciples, that it remained here with them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after he was Riſen from the Dead; They here Own and Acknowledge him, <hi>To be a Prophet, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Deed and in Word,</hi> but they Queſtion whether he were the Meſſias the Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> They could not Reconcile the Ignominy of his Death with the Grandeur of his Office; nor Conceive how the Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of a Croſs was Conſiſtent with the Glory of a King; <hi>We truſted that it had been he which ſhould have Redeemed Iſrael:</hi> As if they had ſaid, we were full of Hopes that this had been the Meſſias ſo long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by us; but this being the Third Day ſince he Dyed, we fear we ſhall find our ſelves miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Then ſaid he unto them, O Fools and ſlow of Heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken; 26 Ought not Chriſt to have Suffered theſe things, and to enter into his Glory? 27 And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Moſes, and all the Prophets, he Expounded unto them in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the things concerning himſelf. 28 And they drew nigh unto the Village whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went, and he made as though he would have gone farther. 29 But they conſtrained him, ſaying, Abide with us for it is towards Evening, and the day is far ſpent; And he went in to tarry with them. 30 And it came to paſs as he ſate at Meat with them, he took Bread, and Bleſſed it, and Brake, and gave to them. 31 And their Eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he Vaniſhed out of their Sight. 32 And they ſaid one to another, Did not our Hearts burn within us, while he talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> (1.) our Saviour Reproves, and then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them, he Reproves them for being Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Senſe of Scripture: They thought the Death of the Meſſias, a ſufficient Ground to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Truth of his Office, when it was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to confirm and eſtabliſh it: <hi>Oh Fools, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Why then do you think your ſelves deceived in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Suffered three Days ago, when his Death doth ſo well agree with the Predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who fore-told that the Meſſias ſhould be cut off, but not for himſelf, and be ſmitten for the iniquities of his People. Here we may <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The
<pb facs="tcp:46556:123"/> great Wiſdom and Grace of God, who makes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Diffidence of his People, an occaſion of farther clearing up the choiceſt Truths unto them: Never did theſe Diſciples hear ſo Excellent an Expoſition of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; concerning the Meſſiah, as now, when their ſinful diſtruſt had ſo far prevailed over them. (2.) <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The Doctrines which Chriſt inſtructs his Diſciples in, namely, in the Neceſſity of his Death and Paſſion, and of his Glory and Exaltation; <hi>Ought not Chriſt to Suffer, and to enter into his Glory. Learn</hi> (1.) That with Reſpect to God's Decree, and with Relation to Mans Guilt, the Death of Chriſt was Neceſſary and Indiſpenſable. (2.) That his Reſurrection and Exaltation was as Neceſſary as his Paſſion. (3.) That there was a Meritorious Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Chriſt's Sufferings and his Glory; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation was Merited by his Paſſion; <hi>He was to drink of the Brook in the way, and then he ſhould lift up his head. Obſerve</hi> (4.) Chriſt did not only put Light into theſe his Apoſtles Heads, but Heat alſo into their Hearts, which burned all the while he Communed with them; <hi>Did not our Hearts burn within us, while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> Oh what an efficacious Power is there in the word of Chriſt, when ſet home upon the Hearts of Men by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>The Fourth and laſt of the <hi>Holy Goſpels</hi> falls now under Conſideration: Namely, That which was written by the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John;</hi> concerning which we have Obſervable, the <hi>Writer,</hi> the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of this Sublime Book. <hi>Obſ. 1.</hi> The Writer of it St. <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Diſciple, that lay in the Boſom of Chriſt; he that lay in Chriſt's Boſom, reveals the Secrets of Chriſt's Heart. <hi>John,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> drew out of the Boſom of Chriſt, the very Heart of Chriſt, and made it known to a loſt World. <hi>Obſ. 2.</hi> The Occaſion of St <hi>John</hi>'s writing this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and that was the Hereſie of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> which denied the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. When God ſuffers Hereticks to vent their blaſphemous Opinions, he takes Occaſion from thence to make a clearer Diſcovery of Divine Truth. We had perhaps wanted St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel,</hi> if <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> had not broach'd their Hereſie againſt Chriſt's Divinity. <hi>Obſ. 3.</hi> The Deſign and Scope of this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is to deſcribe the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his two Natures, <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> as the Object of our Faith: This he doth in a Sublime and Lofty Manner; upon which Account he was compared by the Ancients to the Eagle that ſoars aloft, and maketh her Neſt on high; and was alſo called <hi>John the Divine.

His Eternal Exiſtence: <hi>In the beginning was the Word;</hi> in the beginning when all Things received their Being, then the Word was and did actually ſubſiſt, even from all Eternity. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Antecedent to his Incarnation, but even before all Time and the Beginning of all Things, had an Actual Being and Subſiſtence. 2. His Perſonal Coexiſtence with the Father, <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> that is, eternally and inſeparably with him; in the ſame Eſſence and Nature, being in the Father, as well as with him, ſo that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was never without him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. <hi>I was by him, as one brought up with him,</hi> I was by his Sides, ſays the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Interpreter. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Son is a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, but of the ſame Eſſence and Nature with the Father; he is God of God, very God of very God; being of one Subſtance with the Father, by whom all things were made. <hi>The Word was with God.</hi> 3. His Divine Eſſence: <hi>The Word was God.</hi> Here St. <hi>John</hi> declares the Divinity, as he did before the Eternity of our Bleſſed Saviour. He was with God, and exiſted in him; therefore he muſt be God, and a Perſon diſtinct from the Father. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Eternity, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality and the Divinity of Chriſt are of neceſſity to be believed, if we will worſhip him aright.

That <hi>we muſt worſhip the Son, even as we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father.</hi> Now unleſs we acknowledge the Eternity and Divinity of Chriſt, the Second Perſon, as well as of God the Father, the Firſt Perſon, we honour neither the Father nor the Son. There is this Difference between Natural Things and Supernatural. Natural Things are firſt underſtood, and then believed; but Supernatural Myſteries muſt be firſt believed, and then will be better underſtood. If we will firſt ſet Reaſon on work, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no more than we can comprehend, this will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Faith: But if after we have aſſented to Goſpel My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, we ſet Reaſon on work, this will help Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3 All things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was not any thing made, that was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The Argument which St. <hi>John</hi> uſes to prove Chriſt to be God; it is taken from the Work of Creation. He that made all things is truly and really God; but Chriſt made all Things, and nothing was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, therefore is Chriſt truly and really God. <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. An Affirmation of as large and vaſt an Extent as the whole World. <hi>All Things</hi> were made by him; not this or that particular Being, but <hi>All</hi> Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings received their Exiſtence and Being from Chriſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That to prevent the leaſt Imagination of any Things having another Author than Chriſt, here is the moſt poſitive and particular Negation that can be. That without Him was not any thing made that was made; not without him as an Inſtrument, but without him as an Agent. Chriſt being a Co-worker with the Father and the Spirit in the Work of Creation. He was the Author of the Creation, not an Inſtrument in Creating. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt as God, being the Creator and Maker of all Things himſelf, is excluded from being a Creature, or any thing that was made.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5. And the light ſhineth in darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehended it not.</p>
               <p>Here we have a farther Proof of Chriſt's Divinity, and an Evidence that he had a Being as God, before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; foraſmuch as all Life is center'd in him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by him, and derived from him. In him was Life <hi>Formaliter &amp; Cauſaliter.</hi> Life was formally in Chriſt, as the Subject of it; and alſo cauſally in him as the Fountain of it. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That Chriſt is the Author and Diſpenſer of all Life, unto his Creatures. He is Original Life in the Order of Nature, becauſe by him Man was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. He is ſpiritual Life in the Order of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.</hi> He is Eternal Life in the Order of Glory, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>This is the True God and Eternal Life. Learn,</hi> 2. That all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures receiving Light and Life from Chriſt, not as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, but as the Fountain from whence it floweth, and in which it is preſerved, is an evident Proof of his Divinity, and an Argument that he is truly and really God. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 ¶ There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name <hi>was</hi> John: 7 The ſame came for a witneſs, to bear witneſs of the light, that all men through him might believe. 8 He was not that light, but <hi>was ſent</hi> to bear witneſs of that light. 9 <hi>That</hi> was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>
               <p>Here the Evangeliſt proceeds in declaring Chriſt to be really God, becauſe he was that Original, that Eſſential Light, which had no Beginning, ſuffers no decay, but is ſo diffuſive as in ſome kind, and in ſome meaſure or other, to enlighten every Man that cometh into the World. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Conceit that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as appears by <hi>Luke</hi> 3.15. <hi>The People were in Expectation, and all Men muſed in their Hearts of</hi> John, <hi>whether he were the Chriſt or not.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to undeceive the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Evangeliſt adds, That <hi>John</hi> was not <hi>That Light; John</hi> was a great Light, a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a ſhining Light, but not ſuch a Light as the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be. <hi>John</hi> was a Light Inſtrumentally, Chriſt Efficiently: <hi>John</hi> was a Light enlightened, Chriſt was a Light enlightening: <hi>John</hi>'s Light was by <hi>Derivation</hi> and Participation, Chriſt's was Eſſential and Original: <hi>John</hi>'s Light was as the Light of a Candle in a private Houſe, in and among the <hi>Jews</hi> only; but Chriſt's Light was as the Light of the Sun, ſpreading over the Face of the whole Earth. <hi>This is the True Light that lightens every Man that cometh into the World;</hi> that is, he enlightens all Mankind with the Light of Reaſon, and is the Author of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Illumination in them that receive it. Chriſt is called a <hi>Light</hi> in regard of his Office, which was to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and declare that Salvation to his Church which lay hid before in the purpoſe of God; and he is called the <hi>true Light,</hi> not ſo much in Oppoſition to all falſe Lights, but as oppoſed to the Types &amp; Shadows of the Moſaical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That every Man and Woman that comes into the World is enlightened by Chriſt in ſome Kind and Meaſure, or other. All are enlightned with the Light of Reaſon and a Natural Conſcience: Some with the Light of Grace and Supernatural Illumination. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That Chriſt's being the Eſſential, Original and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light, enlightening and enlivening the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is an evident and undeniable Demonſtration that he is truly and really God.</p>
               <p n="10">10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was in the World,</hi> that is, he that was God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, made himſelf viſible to the World in the fullneſs of Time. The Evangeliſt repeats it again, <hi>That the World was made by him,</hi> to ſhew his Omnipotency and Divinity; and then adds, <hi>That the World knew him not,</hi> as an Evidence of the World's Blindeſs and Ingratitude. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That notwithſtanding the Eternal Son of God appeared in the World, and the World was made and created by him; yet the generality of the World, did not know him; that is, did not own and acknowledge him, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obey him. They neither knew him as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor accepted him as Mediator: Yea, <hi>He came to his own;</hi> that is, his own Kindred and Country, the Church and People of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but the Generality of them gave him cold Entertainment. It was the ſin of the Jewiſh Nation, that though they were Chriſt's own peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; his own by Choice, his own by Purchaſe, his own by Covenant, by Kindred, yet the generality of them did reject him; and would not own him for the True and Promiſed Meſſias. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt met with manifeſt and ſhameful Rejection even at the hands of thoſe that were neareſt to him by Fleſh and Nature, <hi>John</hi> 11.5. <hi>Neither did his Brethren believe on Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, <hi>even</hi> to them that believe on his Name.</p>
               <p>That is, Although multitudes rejected him, yet ſome received and owned him for the True Meſſias; and thoſe that did ſo, he advanced to the high Dignity of Adoption and Sonſhip, giving them Power, that is, Right or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to become the Sons of God. <hi>Here Note,</hi> Firſt, The Nature of Juſtifying Faith, declared; it is to <hi>as many as received him.</hi> Now this Receiving of Chriſt implies theſe three Things, 1. The Aſſent of the Underſtanding to that Divine Teſtimony, which the Scripture gives Chriſt. 2. The Conſent of the Will to ſubmit to this Jeſus as Lord and King. 3. The Affiance and Truſt of the Heart in Chriſt alone for Salvation; for Faith is not a bare Credence, but a Divine Affiance; and ſuch an Affiance in Chriſt, and Reliance upon him, as is the Parent and Principle of Obedience to him. <hi>Note,</hi> 2dly, That it is the high &amp; honourable Privilege of all ſuch as receive Chriſt by Faith, to become the Sons of God by Adoption. This is a precious Privilege, a free Privilege, an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Privilege, an abiding Privilege, and calls for all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Returns of Gratitude and Thankfulneſs, of Love and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:126"/> Service, of Duty and Obedience, of Submiſſion and Self-Reſignation.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the bragging Jews did much boaſt of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth and Deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> as being his Blood and Off-ſpring: Therefore it is here aſſerted, that Men become not the Children of God by Natural Propagation, but by Spiritual Regeneration. They <hi>are not born of Blood.</hi> Grace runs not in a Blood, Piety is not Hereditary. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Parents propagate Corruption, not Regeneration. Were the Conveyances of Grace Natural, good Parents would not be ſo ill ſuited with Children as ſometimes they are. No Perſon then whatſoever, has the gracious Privilege of Adoption by the firſt Birth. <hi>They are not born of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man;</hi> that is, no Man by the utmoſt Improvement of Nature can raiſe himſelf up to this Privilege of Adoption, and be the Author and Efficient Cauſe of his own Regeneration. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Man in all his Capacities is too weak to produce the Work of Regeneration in himſelf. They, ſays Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who by the influence of the higheſt Rational Principles, live moſt exactly according to the Rule of Rational Nature, that is, of unregenerate Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are the Perſons here deſcribed. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That God alone is the Prime Efficient Cauſe of Regeneration. He works upon the Underſtanding by Illumination, and upon the Will by Sanctification; <hi>Which were born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 And the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father) full of grace and truth.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt having aſſerted the Divinity of Chriſt in the foregoing Verſes, comes now to ſpeak of his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Manifeſtation in our Nature, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh:</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Our Saviour's Incarnation for us. 2. His Life and Cenverſation here among us, <hi>He dwelt,</hi> or tabernacled for a Seaſon with us. In the Incarnation, or Aſſumption of our Nature, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Perſon Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, <hi>The Word;</hi> that is, the Second Perſon ſubſiſting in the glorious God-Head. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Nature Aſſumed, <hi>Fleſh:</hi> that is, the Humane Nature, conſiſting of Soul and Body. But why is it not ſaid, <hi>The Word was made Man?</hi> but, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh?</hi> Anſw. To denote and ſet forth the wonderful Abaſement and Condeſcenſion of Chriſt, there being more of Vileneſs, and Weakneſs and Oppoſition to Spirit, in the Word <hi>Fleſh,</hi> than in the Word <hi>Man:</hi> Chriſt's taking Fleſh, implies, that he did not only take upon him the Humane Nature, but all the Weakneſſes and Infirmities of that Nature alſo, (ſinful Infirmities and perſonal Infirmities excepted) he had nothing to do with our ſinful Fleſh: Tho' Chriſt loved Souls with an infinite and inſuperable Love, yet he would not ſin to ſave a Soul. And he took no perſonal Infirmities upon him, but ſuch as are common to the whole Nature, as Hunger, Thirſt, Wearineſs, <hi>&amp;c. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Aſſumption it ſelf, <hi>He was made Fleſh;</hi> that is, he aſſumed the Humane Nature into an Union with his God-head, and ſo became a True and Real Man by that Aſſumption. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt did really aſſume the true and perfect Nature of Man, into a perſonal Union with his Divine Nature, and ſtill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains True God, and True Man in one Perſon for ever. Oh bleſſed Union! Oh thrice happy Conjunction! As Man, Chriſt has an experimental Senſe of our Infirmities and Wants. As God, he can ſupport and ſupply them All. <hi>Note farther,</hi> 2. As our Saviour's Incarnation for us, ſo his Life and Converſation among us. <hi>He dwelt,</hi> or taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled amongſt us. The Tabernacle was a Type of Chriſt's Humane Nature. 1. As the out-ſide of the Tabernacle was mean, made of ordinary Materials, but it's inſide glorious, ſo was the Son of God. 2. God's ſpecial Preſence was in the Tabernacle, there he dwelt, for he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein. In like manner dwelt all the fulneſs of the God-head bodily in Chriſt; and the glory of his Divinity ſhined forth to the Eye and view of his Diſciples; for <hi>they beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only Begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that is, whilſt Chriſt appeared as a Man amongſt us, he gave great and glorious Teſtimonies of his Being the Son of God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That in the Day of our Saviour's Incarnation, the Divinity of his Perſon did ſhine forth through the Vail of his Fleſh, and was ſeen by all them that had a Spiritual Eye to behold it, and a mind diſpoſed to conſider it. <hi>We beheld his Glory, as the Glory of the only Begotten of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">¶ 15 John bare witneſs of him, and cried, ſaying, This was he of whom I ſpake, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me; for he was before me. 16 And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt. 18 No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten ſon which is in the boſom of the father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's firſt Teſtimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt the promiſed Meſſiah: And it conſiſts of four Parts, 1. <hi>John</hi> prefers Chriſt before himſelf, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurpaſſingly above himſelf. <hi>He that cometh after me is preferred before me,</hi> that is, in the Dignity of his Perſon, and in the Eminency of his Office, as being the eternal God. Now <hi>amongſt them that were born of Women, there was not a greater than John the Baptiſt:</hi> If Chriſt then was greater than <hi>John,</hi> it was in regard of his being God. He is therefore <hi>preferred before him, becauſe he was before him,</hi> as being God from all Eternity. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Eternity of Chriſt's Perſon as God, ſets him up above all his Miniſters, yea, above all Creatures, how excellent ſoever. <hi>He that cometh after me</hi> in Time, <hi>is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before me</hi> in Dignity, <hi>for he was before me,</hi> even from all Eternity. 2. <hi>John</hi> prefers Chriſt before all Believers in Point of Fulneſs and Sufficiency of Divine Grace: <hi>Of his Fulneſs do they receive.</hi> They have their Fillings, Chriſt has his Fulneſs; theirs is the fulneſs of a Veſſel, his is the Fulneſs of a Fountain; their fulneſs is Derivative, his Fulneſs is Original, yet alſo Miniſterial, on purpoſe in him to give out to us, that we may <hi>receive Grace for Grace;</hi> that is, Grace anſwerable for Kind and Quality, though not for Meaſure and Degree. As a Child in Generation receives from its Parents Member for Member, or as the Paper in the Printing-Preſs receives Letter for Letter, and the Wax under the Seal receives print for print: So in the Work of Regeneration whatever Grace is in Chriſt, there is the like for Kind inſtampt upon the Chriſtian's Soul. All the Members of Chriſt being made plentiful Partakers of his Spiritual Endowments. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That all fulneſs of Grace, by way of Supply for Believers is treaſured up in Chriſt, and communicated by him as their Wants and Neceſſities do require: His Fulneſs is inexhauſtible, it can never be drawn low, much leſs drawn dry. <hi>Of his Fulneſs do we receive Grace for Grace;</hi> that is, Grace freely, Grace plentifully. God grant that none of us may receive the Grace of Chriſt in vain. 3. <hi>John</hi> prefers Chriſt before <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> doated ſo much upon. <hi>The Law was given by Moſes,</hi> not as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but as the Diſpenſer of it. <hi>Moſes</hi> was God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by whom the Law which reveals Wrath, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but <hi>Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt. Grace</hi> in Oppoſition to the Condemnatory Curſe and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law; and <hi>Truth</hi> in Oppoſition to the Types, Shadows and Ceremonies of the Legal Adminiſtration. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That all Grace for Remiſſion of Sin, and for Performance of Duty, is given from Chriſt the Fountain of Grace: <hi>Grace came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Grace of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Reconciliation, the Grace of Holineſs and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, the Grace of Love and Adoption, even all that Grace that fits us for Service here and Glory hereafter, Chriſt is both the Diſpenſer and the Author of it. <hi>Grace came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Again, 4. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt here (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) doth not only prefer Chriſt before himſelf, before <hi>Moſes,</hi> before all Believers, but even before all Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in Point of Knowing and Revealing the Mind of God. <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi> that is, no meer Man hath ever ſeen God in his Eſſence, whilſt he was in this
<pb facs="tcp:46556:127"/> mortal State. Here God's Inviſibility is aſſerted; next Chriſt's Intimacy with the Father is declared. <hi>The only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that is in the Boſom of the Father.</hi> This Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion implies three Things, 1. Unity of Natures; the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom is the Child's Place, who is part of our ſelves and of the ſame Nature with our ſelves. 2. Dearneſs of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. None lye in the Boſom, but the Perſon that is very dear to us. A Boſom Friend is the deareſt of Friends. 3. It implies Communication of Secrets. Chriſt's lying in his Fathers Boſom intimates his being conſcious to all his Father's Secrets, to know all his Counſels, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his whole Will and Pleaſure. Now as Chriſt's lying in the Father's Boſom implies Unity of Nature, it <hi>teacheth</hi> us to give the ſame Worſhip to Chriſt, which we give to God the Father, becauſe he is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the Father; as it implies Dearneſs of Affection betwixt the Father and the Son, it <hi>teaches</hi> us to place our chief Love upon Chriſt the Son, becauſe God the Father doth ſo: He, who is the Son of God's Love, ſhould be the Object of our Love; as God hath a Boſom for Chriſt, ſo ſhould we have alſo; the nobleſt Object challenges the higheſt Affection. Again, as Chriſt's lying in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Boſom implies the Knowledge of his Mind and Will; it <hi>teaches</hi> us to apply our ſelves to Chriſt, to his Word and Spirit for Illumination. Whither ſhould we go for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to this Great Prophet, for Direction, but to this wonderful Counſellor? We can never be made wiſe unto Salvation, if Chriſt, the Wiſdom of the Father, doth not make us ſo.</p>
               <p n="19">¶ 19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews ſent prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem, to ask him, Who art thou? 20 And he confeſſed, and denied not; but confeſſed, I am not the Chriſt. 21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he ſaith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he anſwered, No: 22 Then ſaid they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an anſwer to them that ſent us: What ſayeſt thou of thy ſelf? 23 He ſaid, I <hi>am</hi> the voice of one crying in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Make ſtraight the way of the Lord, as ſaid the prophet Eſaias. 24 And they which were ſent, were of the Phariſees. 25 And they asked him, and ſaid unto him, Why bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeſt thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, neither that prophet? 26 John anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, ſaying, I baptize with water: but there ſtandeth one among you, whom ye know not; 27 He it is who coming after me, is preferred before me, whoſe ſhoes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe. 28 Theſe things were done in Beth-abara beyond Jordan, where John was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes we have a ſecond Teſtimony, which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt gave of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Jews ſent Prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem, ſaying, Who art thou?</hi> That is, the Sanhedrim, or Great Council at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to whom it belonged to judge who were True Prophets, ſent Meſſengers to the Baptiſt to know whether he was the Meſſias or not. <hi>John</hi> refuſes to take this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to himſelf, but tells them plainly, He was his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger and Forerunner, and that the Meſſias himſelf was juſt at hand. From hence <hi>Note,</hi> how very cautious and exceeding careful this Meſſenger of Chriſt was, and all the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to be, that they do not aſſume or arrogate to themſelves any part of that Honour which is due to Chriſt, but ſet the Crown of Praiſe upon Chriſt's own Head, acknowledging him to be All in All, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Who then is Paul? and who is Apollo? but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by whom ye believed. Obſerve farther,</hi> in this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, theſe two Things, 1. A Negative Declaration, who he was not: <hi>I am not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> whom you look for, <hi>nor Elias, nor that Prophet,</hi> you expect; not <hi>Elias,</hi> that is, in your Senſe, not <hi>Elias</hi> the Tiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, not <hi>Elias</hi> for identity of Perſon, but <hi>Elias</hi> for Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Gifts, Office and Calling. <hi>John</hi> came though not in the Perſon, yet in the Power and Spirit of <hi>Elias.</hi> He farther denies that he was <hi>That Prophet;</hi> that Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. nor any of the old Prophets riſen from the dead, nay, ſtrictly ſpeaking he was not any Prophet at all, <hi>but more than a Prophet:</hi> The Old Teſtament Prophets propheſied of Chriſt to come, but <hi>John</hi> pointed at, ſhewed and declared a Chriſt already come; and in this Senſe he was no meer Prophet, but more than a Prophet. 2. We have here the Baptiſt's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Affirmation, who he was, namely, Chriſt's He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld in the Wilderneſs, his Uſher, his Fore-runner, to prepare the People for the receiving of the Meſſias, and to make them ready for the Entertaining of the Goſpel, by preaching the Doctrine of Repentance to them. From hence <hi>Learn,</hi> That the preaching of the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is indiſpenſably neceſſary, in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of the Hearts of Sinners for the receiving of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Obſerve laſtly,</hi> The Great &amp; Exemplary Humility of the holy Baptiſt, the mean and lowly Opinion he had of himſelf. Although <hi>John</hi> was the greateſt among them that were born of a Woman, and ſo much eſteemed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and had the honour to go before Chriſt in the Exerciſe of his Office and Miniſtry, yet he judges himſelf unworthy to carry Chriſt's Shoes after him. <hi>He that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after me is preferred before me, whoſe Shoes I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to unlooſe. Learn hence,</hi> That the more eminent Gifts the Miniſters of the Goſpel have, and the more ready Men are to honour and eſteem them, the more will they abaſe themſelves, if they be truly Gracious, and account themſelves highly honoured in doing the meaneſt Offices of Love and Service for Jeſus Chriſt. Thus doth the holy Baptiſt here. <hi>His Shoes Latchet I am not worthy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 ¶ The next day John ſeeth Jeſus coming unto him, and ſaith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſin of the world. 30 This is he of whom I ſaid, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's third Teſtimony concerning Chriſt; in which he points out Chriſt as the True Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Expiation of Sin. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God;</hi> the Lamb of God's appointing to be an Expiatory Sacrifice; the Lamb of God's Election; the Lamb of God's Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Lamb of God's Acceptation; the Lamb of God's Exaltation; who, by the Sacrifice of his death, <hi>has taken away the ſin of the World.</hi> The ſin, not the ſins, in the plural Number, to denote Original Sin, as ſome think, or as others, to ſhew that Chriſt has univerſally taken upon himſelf the whole Burthen of our Sin and Guilt. And there ſeems to be a ſecret Antitheſis in the Word, <hi>World.</hi> In the Levitical Sacrifices only the ſins of the <hi>Jews</hi> were laid upon the ſacrificed Beaſt; but this Lamb takes away the ſin both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile. The Lord hath cauſed to meet on him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> And the Word, <hi>Taketh Away,</hi> being of the Preſent Tenſe, denotes a continued Act, and it intimates to us thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the daily Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, to take away our ſin by preſenting to the Father the Memorials of his Death. Chriſt takes away from all Believers the Guilt and Puniſhment of their ſins, the Filth and Pollution of them: the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion that is in them; and as St. <hi>John</hi> called upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> to behold this Lamb of God, with an Eye of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: ſo is it our Duty to behold him now with an Eye of Admiration, with an Eye of Gratulation, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with an Eye of Faith and Dependence, improving the Fruit of his Death to our own Conſolation and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="31">31 And I knew him not: but that he ſhould be made manifeſt to Iſrael, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 32 And John bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 33 And I knew him not: but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, Upon
<pb facs="tcp:46556:127"/> whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he which bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth with the holy Ghoſt. 34 And I ſaw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, tho' a near Kinſman of Chriſt's according to the Fleſh; yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God ſo ordered it, that for thirty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they did not know one another, nor converſe with each other, nor probably ever ſaw the faces of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to be ſure he did not know him to be the Meſſiah. This no doubt was over-ruled by the wiſdom of God, to prevent all ſuſpicion, as if <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together to give one another Credit, that the World might ſuſpect nothing of the Truth of <hi>John</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony concerning Chriſt, or have the leaſt jealouſie that what he ſaid of Chriſt, was from any Bias of Mind to his Perſon; therefore he repeats it a ſecond time, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>I knew him not.</hi> Hence we may <hi>learn,</hi> That a Corporal ſight of Chriſt, and an outward Perſonal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, is not ſimply needful and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for enabling a Miniſter to ſet him forth, and repreſent him ſavingly to the World. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Means declared, by which <hi>John</hi> came to know Chriſt to be the true Meſſiah; it was by a Sign from Heaven, namely, the Holy Ghoſt deſcending like a Dove upon our Saviour. <hi>He that ſent me to Baptize with Water, the ſame ſaid unto me, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining, the ſame is he. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Chriſt taking upon him our Nature, did ſo cover his Glory with the Veil of our Fleſh and common Infirmities, that he could not be known by bodily ſight from another Man. Till <hi>John</hi> had a divine Revelation, and an evident Sign from Heaven, that Chriſt was the Son of God, <hi>he knew him not. Learn,</hi> 2. That Chriſt in his ſolemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon his Office, as Mediator, was ſealed unto the Work by the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt upon him; he was ſealed by the Holy Ghoſt's deſcending, and the Teacher's teſtifying, that this was his beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed. Now it was, that God gave not the Spirit to Chriſt by Meaſure, for the effectual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of his Mediatorial Office; now <hi>it pleaſed the Father that in Chriſt ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> He was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Extenſively with all Kinds of Grace, and filled Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively with all Degrees of Grace, in the Day of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration,</hi> when the Holy Spirit deſcended upon him.</p>
               <p n="35">¶ 35 Again, the next day after, John ſtood, and two of his diſciples: 36 And looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus as he walked, he ſaid, Behold the Lamb of God.</p>
               <p>It is evident that <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples were never very willing to acknowledge Jeſus for the Meſſias, becauſe they thought he did ſhadow and cloud their Maſter. See therefore the Sincerity of the Holy Baptiſt, he takes every Opportunity to draw off the Eyes of his own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from himſelf, and to fix them upon Chriſt; he ſaith to two of his Diſciples, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Turn your Eyes from me to Chriſt, take leſs Notice of me his Miniſter; but, behold your and my Lord and Maſter: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God. Learn hence,</hi> That the great Deſign of Chriſt's faithful Miniſters, is to ſet People upon admiring of Chriſt, and not magnifying themſelves. Oh! 'tis their great Ambition and Deſire, that ſuch as love and reſpect them, and honour their Miniſtry, may be led by them to Chriſt; to behold and admire him, to accept of him, and to ſubmit unto him: <hi>John ſaid to his Diſciples, Behold the Lamb of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37 And the two diſciples heard him ſpeak, and they followed Jeſus. 38 Then Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and ſaw them following, and ſaith unto them, What ſeek ye? They ſaid unto him, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, (which is to ſay, being interpreted, Maſter) where dwelleſt thou? 39 He ſaith unto them, Come and ſee. They came and ſaw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour. 40 One of the two which heard John <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother. 41 He firſt findeth his own brother Simon, and ſaith unto him, We have found the Meſſias, which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interpreted, the Chriſt. 42 And he brought him to Jeſus. And when Jeſus beheld him, he ſaid, Thou art Simon the ſon of Jona: thou ſhalt be called Cephas, which is by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſtone. 43 ¶ The day following, Jeſus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and ſaith unto him, Follow me. 44 Now Philip was of Bethſaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>
               <p>This latter part of the Chapter acquaints tis with the calling of five Diſciples; not to the Apoſtleſhip, for that was afterwards; nor yet ſimply by Converſion, for ſome of them were <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples already, and believed in the Meſſiah to come; but they are here called to own and acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah. The Diſciples here called, were <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> mean and obſcure Perſons, poor Fiſher-men, not any of the learned Rabbies and Doctors among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Hereby Chriſt ſhewed at once the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of his Grace, in paſſing by the knowing Men of the Age; the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of his Power, who by ſuch weak Inſtruments could effect ſuch mighty Things; and the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Wiſdom, in chuſing ſuch Inſtruments as ſhould not carry away the Glory of the Work from him; but cauſe the Intire, Honour and Glory of all their great Succeſſes to redound to Chriſt. As Chriſt can do, ſo he chuſes to do great things by weak means; knowing that the weakneſs of the Inſtrument redounds to the greater Honour of the Agent. For theſe Perſons called now to be Diſciples, were afterwards ſent forth by Chriſt as his Apoſtles, to convert the World unto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. <hi>Obſerve</hi> farther, The Order according to which the Diſciples were called; firſt <hi>Andrew,</hi> then <hi>Peter;</hi> which may make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſhamed of the Weakneſs of their Argument for <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, that he was firſt called; whereas <hi>Andrew</hi> was before him, and <hi>Peter</hi> was brought to Jeſus by him. <hi>Andrew findeth his own Brother Simon, brought him to Jeſus.</hi> Such as have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any Knowledge of Chriſt themſelves, and are let into Acquaintance with him, will be very diligent to invite, and induſtrious to bring in others to him. <hi>Peter</hi> being brought to Chriſt, our Saviour names him <hi>Cephas,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Stone,</hi> a <hi>Rock;</hi> to intimate to him his Duty, to be firm and ſteady in the Chriſtian Profeſſion, full of Courage and Conſtancy. <hi>Thou ſhalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="45">45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and ſaith unto him, We have found him of whom Moſes in the law, and the prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth, the ſon of Joſeph. 46 And Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael ſaid unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip ſaith unto him, Come and ſee. 47 Jeſus ſaw Nathanael coming to him, and ſaith of him, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</p>
               <p>The laſt Perſon mentioned in this Chapter, who was called to own and embrace Chriſt for the Meſſiah, is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael:</hi> Who this <hi>Nathanael</hi> was, doth not certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; but, it is evident, he was a ſincere, good Man, tho' prejudiced for the preſent againſt Chriſt, becauſe of the Place of his ſuppoſed Birth and Reſidence, <hi>Nazareth: Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</hi> That is, can any worthy or excellent Perſon, much leſs the promiſed and long expected Meſſias, come out of ſuch an obſcure Place as <hi>Nazareth</hi> is? Whereas Almighty God, when ever he pleaſes, can raiſe worthy Perſons out of contemptible Places. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> How mercifully and meekly Chriſt paſſes over the Miſtakes and Failings, the Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
<pb facs="tcp:46556:128"/> and Prejudices of <hi>Nathanael;</hi> but takes notice of and publickly proclaims his Sincerity: <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</hi> That is, no Guile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, no Guile concealed, no prevailing Guile: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only true of Chriſt, in a ſtrict and abſolute Senſe, that there was no Guile found in his Lips. But in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Senſe it is true of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> and every upright Man, they are true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> like their Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> plain Men, Men of great ſincerity and uprightneſs of Heart, both in the ſight of God and Man. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Saviour ſpeaks of him with a ſort of Admiration: <hi>Behold an Iſraelite in whom is no guile. We learn,</hi> That a Perſon of great Sincerity and Uprightneſs of Heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Man, a true <hi>Nathanael,</hi> an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, is a rare and a worthy ſight. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed. Learn,</hi> 2. That ſuch as are indeed <hi>Nathanael</hi>'s, need not commend themſelves, Chriſt will be ſure to do it for them. <hi>Nathanael</hi> conceals his own worth, Chriſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes and proclaims it, and calls upon others to take notice of it. <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="48">48 Nathanael ſaith unto him, Whence know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou me? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou waſt under the fig-tree, I ſaw thee. 49 Nathanael anſwered and ſaith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael. 50 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-tree, believeſt thou? thou ſhalt ſee greater things then theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How <hi>Nathanael</hi> wondereth that Chriſt ſhould know him, having (as he thought) never ſeen him. Chriſt gives him to underſtand; that by his All-ſeeing Eye he had ſeen him, when he was not ſeen by him: <hi>When thou wert under the fig-tree, I ſaw thee.</hi> Chriſt's All-ſeeing, Eye is an infallible Proof of his Deity and Godhead. Chriſt ſeeth us where ever we are, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, tho' we ſee not him: He ſeeth the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Hearts, and will own it, and bear witneſs to it, if we are upright in his ſight. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> How Chriſt's Omnipreſence and Omniſcience convinces <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael,</hi> that he was more than Man, even the Meſſias, God and Man, in two diſtinct Natures and one Perſon. <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God. Philip</hi> called Chriſt the Son of <hi>Joſeph. Nathanael</hi> calls him, the Son of God. Such as believe Chriſt's Omniſciency, will never call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his Divinity. <hi>Obſerve, Laſtly,</hi> How Chriſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the Faith of this new Diſciple, <hi>Nathanael,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him, that he ſhould enjoy farther helps and means for the Confirmation of his Faith, than ever yet he had. All that Chriſt ſaid to him, was only this, That <hi>he ſaw him under the fig-tree before Philip called him.</hi> How ready art thou, Oh Lord! to encourage the beginnings of Faith in the Hearts of thy People, and to furniſh them with farther means of Knowledge, when they wiſely improve what they have received. Never wilt thou be wanting, either in Means or Mercy to us, if we be not wanting to thee and our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="51">51 And he ſaith unto him, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Hereafter you ſhall ſee heaven open, and the angels of God aſcending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending upon the Son of man.</p>
               <p>The Heavens were open to Chriſt, and the Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon him, firſt at his Baptiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> then at his Aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. Whether Chriſt alludes to the one or the other, or to both, I ſhall not poſitively ſay; but gather this <hi>Note,</hi> That the Miniſtry and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of the Holy Angels upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the time of his Humiliation, was very remarkable: An Angel foretels his Conception to the Virgin, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. an Angel publiſhes his Birth to the Shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. In his Temptations in the Wilderneſs, the Angels came and miniſtered unto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.11. In his Agony in the Garden, an Angel is ſent to Comfort him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. At his Reſurrection, an Angel rolls away the Stone, and proclaims him Riſen, to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſought for him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.6. At his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Angels attended upon him, and bear him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to Heaven. And at the Day of Judgment, he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels. Now, thus officious are the Holy Angels to our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and thus ſubſervient to him upon all Occaſions. 1. In Point of Affection and Singular Love to Chriſt. 2. In Point of Duty and Special Obligation to Chriſt. There is no ſuch chearful and delightful Service as the Service of Love. Such is the Angels Service to Chriſt; for the Services he has done them, he being an Head of Confirmation to them: For, that they are eſtabliſhed in that holy and glorious State in which they were at firſt created, is owing to the ſpecial Grace of the Redeemer. <hi>Glorifie him then all ye Angels, and praiſe him all his Hoſt.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 AND the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jeſus was there. 2 And both Jeſus was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and his diſciples, to the marriage.</p>
               <p>The former Part of this Chapter acquaints us with the firſt Miracle which our Saviour wrought, in turning Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine; the Occaſion of it was, his being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Marriage Feaſt. <hi>Here Note firſt,</hi> That when ever our Saviour was invited to a publick Entertainment, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refuſed the Invitation, but conſtantly went; not ſo much for the Pleaſure of Eating, as for the Opportunity of Converſing and doing Good; which was Meat and Drink unto him. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. What Honour Chriſt puts upon the Ordinance of Marriage; he Honours it with his Preſence and firſt Miracle. Some think it was St. <hi>John</hi> that was now the Bridegroom; others, that it was ſome near Relation of the Virgin Mothers: But, whoever it might be, doubtleſs Chriſt's Deſign was rather to put Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the Ordinance than upon the Perſon. How bold is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſpitting upon the Face of this Ordinance, by denying its Lawfulneſs to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Religion? when the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. affirms, <hi>that Marriage is honourable among all.</hi> Neither the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Old Teſtament, nor the Apoſtles of the New (St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf not excepted) did abhor the Marriage Bed, or judge themſelves too pure for an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their Maker. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. That it is an ancient and laudable Inſtitution, that the Rights of Marriage ſhould not want a ſolemn Celebration. Feaſting with Friends upon ſuch an Occaſion is both lawful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, provided the Rules of Sobriety and Charity, Modeſty and Decency be obſerved, and no ſinful Liberty aſſumed. But it muſt Be ſaid, That Feaſting in general, and Marriage Feaſts in particular, are ſome of thoſe lawful Things which are very difficultly managed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin. <hi>Note,</hi> 4. That our Saviour working a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle when he was at a Marriage-Feaſt, ſhould teach us by his Example, that in our chearful and free times, when we indulge a little more than ordinary to Mirth amongſt our Friends, we ſhould ſtill be mindful of God's Honour and Glory, and lay hold upon an Occaſion of doing all the Good we can. <hi>Note, Laſtly,</hi> As Chriſt was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally invited to, and bodily preſent at this Marriage-Feaſt when here on Earth; ſo he will not refuſe now in heaven to be ſpiritually preſent at his Peoples Marriages: They want his Preſence with them upon that great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, they deſire and ſeek it; he is acquainted with it, and invited to it, who ever is neglected: And where Chriſt is made acquainted with the Match, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make one at the Marriage. Happy is that Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, where Chriſt and his Friends (as here) are the invited, expected and enjoyed Gueſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jeſus ſaith unto him, They have no wine. 4 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:128"/> 5 His mother ſaith unto the ſervants, Whatſoever he ſaith unto you, do <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This want of Wine was probably ſo diſpoſed by the Providence of God, to give our Saviour an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to manifeſt his Divine Power in working a Miracle to ſupply it. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Virgin inquires into the Families Wants, and then makes them known to Chriſt. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is an Argument of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and an Evidence of Chriſtian Love, to inquire into the Wants, and to recommend the Neceſſities of others to Chriſt's Care and Conſideration; whoſe Bounty and Munificence can readily and abundantly ſupply them. Thus far the Virgins Action was Good, ſhe laid open the Caſe to Chriſt; <hi>they have no Wine:</hi> But Chriſt, who diſcern'd the Thoughts of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Heart, finds her guilty of Preſumption; ſhe thought by her motherly Authority ſhe might have expected, if not commanded a Miracle from him: Whereas Chriſt was ſubject to her, as Man, during his private Life; but now being entered upon his Office, as a Mediator, as God-Man, he gives her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſhe had no Power over him, nor any Motherly Authority in the Buſineſs of his Publick Office; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſays to her, <hi>Woman,</hi> not Mother, <hi>what have I to do with thee? Obſerve therefore,</hi> 2. Chriſt calls the Virgin, <hi>Woman,</hi> not <hi>Mother;</hi> but this not out of any Contempt, but to prevent her being thought more than a Woman, above and beyond a Woman, having brought forth the Son of God: <hi>Woman,</hi> ſays Chriſt, not <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would make her, and proclaim her free from Sin, even from Venial Sin: But Chriſt's reproving of her, ſhews that ſhe was not faultleſs. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. Chriſt would not bear with the Virgin's Commanding on Earth; will he then indure her Interceſſion in Heaven? Muſt ſhe not meddle with Matters pertaining to his Office here below<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and will it be indured by Chriſt, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by her, to interpoſe in the Work of Mediation, above? No, no; were it poſſible for her ſo far to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſelf in Heaven, ſhe would receive the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from Chriſt which ſhe had on Earth, <hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee?</hi> Or, Thou with me in my Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Office? But, inſtead of this, ſhe returns Anſwer from Heaven to her Idolatrous Petitioners here on Earth, What have I to do with you? get you to my Son, go you to Chriſt, he that was the Mediator of Redemption; he, and only he, continues the Mediator of Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And there were ſet there ſix water-pots of ſtone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 7 Jeſus ſaith unto them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 8 And he ſaith unto them, Draw out now, and bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the governour of the feaſt. And they bare <hi>it.</hi> 9 When the ruler of the feaſt had taſted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the ſervants which drew the water knew) the governour of the feaſt called the bridegroom, 10 And ſaith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth ſet forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worſe: <hi>but</hi> thou haſt kept the good wine until now. 11 This beginning of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee, and manifeſted forth his glory; and his diſciples believed on him.</p>
               <p>In this Miracle of our Saviour's turning Water into Wine, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The reality of the Miracle, and the ſincerity of Chriſt in the working of it: To evidence that there was no deceit in the Miracle, not Wine-Casks, but Water-Pots are called for; Wine-Veſſels, in which ſome Lees were remaining, might have given both a vinous colour and taſte to the Water; but Stone-Pots could contribute nothing of this nature; and being open Pots, there was no ſtealing Wine into them without Obſervation. <hi>Again,</hi> Our Saviour's employing of the Servants, and not his Diſciples, takes off any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of Colluſion; and his ſending it to the Ruler or Governor of the Feaſt, was an evidence that the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle would bear Examination. Our Saviour's Miracles were real and beneficial; they were obvious to Senſe, not lying Wonders, not fictitious Miracles, which the Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cheat the People with: The greateſt Miracle which they boaſt of, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> is ſo far from being obvious to Senſe, that it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind, and is the greateſt Affront to humane nature that ever the World was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Tho' Chriſt wrought a real Miracle, yet he would not work more of Miracle than needed; he would not create Wine out of nothing, but turned Water into Wine. Thus he multiplied the Bread, changed the Water, reſtored withered Limbs, raiſed dead Bodies, ſtill working upon that which was, and not creating that which was not: Chriſt never wrought a Miracle but when needful, and then wrought no more of Miracle than he needed. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and Bounty of Chriſt in the Miracle here wrought; <hi>ſix Water-pots are filled</hi> with Wine; enough, ſay ſome Writers, for an Hundred and fifty Men; had he turned but one of thoſe large Veſſels into Wine, it had been a ſufficient Proof of his Power; but to fill ſo many, was an Inſtance both of his Power and Mercy. The Lord of the Family furniſhes his Houſhold not barely for Neceſſity, but for Delight, giving richly all Things to enjoy. And as the Bounty of Chriſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Quantity, ſo in the Excellency of the Wine. <hi>Thou haſt kept the beſt Wine till now,</hi> ſays the Governor of the Feaſt: It was fit that Chriſt's miraculous Wine ſhould be more perfect than the natural. But, Oh <hi>Bleſſed Saviour!</hi> how delicate and delicious ſhall that Wine be, which we ſhall drink ere long with thee in thy Father's Kingdom! Let thy Holy Spirit fill the Veſſel of my Heart with Water, (with godly Sorrow and Contrition) and thou wilt turn it into Wine. For, <hi>bleſſed are they that mourn, they ſhall be comforted. Obſerve,</hi> 4. The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effect of this Miracle: Chriſt hereby <hi>manifeſted forth his Glory, and his Diſciples believed in him.</hi> 1. <hi>He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted forth his Glory;</hi> that is, the Glory of his God-head, as doing this by his own Power. Here ſhined forth his Omnipotency, his Bounty and Liberality, every thing that might beſpeak him both the Great and Good God. The ſecond Effect of this Miracle was, That <hi>the Diſciples believed on him.</hi> The great End of Miracles is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Faith; God never ſets the Seal of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency to a Lye: All the Miracles then that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, were as ſo many Seals, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel is true. <hi>If you believe not me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>believe the works which I do, for they bear witneſs of me,</hi> John 5.36.</p>
               <p n="12">12 ¶ After this, he went down to Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his diſciples, and they continued there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days. 13 ¶ And the Jews paſſover was at hand, and Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem, 14 And found in the temple thoſe that ſold oxen, and ſheep, and doves, and the changers of money ſitting: 15 And when he had made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the ſheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers money, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the tables; 16 And ſaid unto them that ſold doves, Take theſe things hence; make not my Fathers houſe an houſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How obedient in all things Chriſt was to the Ceremonial Law: He was not naturally ſubject to the Law, but to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, he kept the Paſſoever yearly, according to the Command of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. That <hi>all the Males ſhould appear before him</hi> in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Hence it is probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that Chriſt came up to the Paſſover continually
<pb facs="tcp:46556:129"/> during his private Life; and being now come up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to this firſt Paſſover after his Baptiſm, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn entrance upon his Office, his firſt Walk was to the Temple, and his firſt Work was to purge and reform it from Abuſes, and not to ruine and deſtroy it, becauſe it had been abuſed. Now the Abuſe and Prophanation of the Temple at that time was this; In the outward Court of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there was a publick Mart or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, where were ſold Oxen, Sheep and Doves, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; which otherwiſe the People with great Labour and Trouble muſt have brought up along with them for Sacrifice. Therefore as a pretended Eaſe to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Prieſts ordered theſe Things to be ſold hard by the Altar; the Intention was commendable, but the Action not juſtifiable. No pretences of good Ends can juſtifie that which is forbidden of God: A good End can never juſtifie an irregular Action. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's fervent Zeal in purging and reforming his Father's Houſe. The ſight of Sin in any Perſons, but eſpecially in and among Profeſſors, ought to kindle in our Hearts (as it did here in Chriſt's Breaſt) a burning Zeal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt it. Yet was not Chriſt's Zeal ſo warm as to devote the Temple to deſtruction, becauſe of its Abuſe and Prophanation. Places dedicated to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God, if idolatrouſly abuſed, muſt not be pulled down, but purged; not ruined, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. There is a ſpecial Reverence due to the Houſe of God, both for the Owners ſake and the Service ſake. Nothing but Holineſs becomes that Place where God is worſhipped in the Beauty of Holineſs. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The greatneſs of this Miracle, in the weakneſs of the Means, which Chriſt made uſe of to effect and work it: He drove the Buyers and Sellers before him out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but how, and with what? St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. ſays, That certain fiery Rays or Beams darting from Chriſt's Eyes, drove out theſe Merchants from this place. I dare not avouch this, but am ſatisfied that Chriſt drove them out, unarmed with any Weapons that might carry Dread and Terror with them, at moſt but with a Whip of ſmall Cords; which, probably, might be ſcattered by the Drovers that came thither to ſell their Cattle. Behold then the weakneſs of the Means on the one ſide, and conſider the greatneſs of the Oppoſition on the other: Here was a Confluence of People to oppoſe Chriſt, this being the moſt ſolemn Mart of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and here were Merchant Men whoſe Hearts were ſet upon Gain (the Worlds God) to oppoſe him. But neither the weakneſs of the Means, nor the greatneſs of the Oppoſition did diſmay him, or cauſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to deſiſt from the Attempt of reforming what was amiſs in the Houſe of God. <hi>Learn we hence,</hi> That it matters not how weak the Means of Church-Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, nor how ſtrong the oppoſite Power is; if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Chriſt in the Undertaking, the Work ſhall certainly be accompliſhed. Oh, how great was the Work, and how weak and unlikely were the Means here! A parcel of ſturdy Fellows, whoſe Hearts were ſet upon their Wealth, Chriſt no ſooner ſpeaks to them, and ſhakes his Whip at them, but like a company of fearful Hares they run before him. Chriſt in purging of his Church will make every thing yield and give way to his Power. Let it Comfort the Church under all unlikelyhood of Reformation. Who art thou, Oh great Mountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſpiritual <hi>Zerubbabel?</hi> Thou ſhalt become a Plain. I ſhall cloſe my Obſervations upon this Miracle of Chriſt's whipping the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, which both St. <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> do make the greateſt Miracle that ever Chriſt wrought, all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered; I ſhall cloſe it with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; <hi>viz.</hi> Was there ſuch Power and Terror in Chriſt's Countenance and Speech here in the Temple in the days of his Fleſh? Oh, how terrible then will his Face and his Appearance be to the wicked and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent World at the great Day! Lord! how fearful will his Iron Scourge then be! How terrifying that Voice, Depart, depart from me; depart accurſed; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part into Fire; depart into everlaſting Fire, into a Fire prepared for the Puniſhment of Apoſtate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Devil and his Angels. God grant we may wiſely conſider it, and timely flee from the Wrath to come.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How exceedingly offended the <hi>Jews</hi> were at the Reformation which our Saviour had made in the Houſe of God: They were awed indeed with the Majeſty of this great Work, and durſt not openly oppoſe, but ſecretly malign it. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> That a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of Abuſes in God's Worſhip, eſpecially if it croſſes our Eaſe, and controuls our Profit (as this did) is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtaſted. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How theſe <hi>Jews</hi> diſcover their old inveterate Diſeaſe of Infidelity; they require a Sign, and call for a Miracle to juſtifie Chriſt's Commiſſion. Why! had they not a Miracle before their Eyes? Was not the Work of purging the Temple, a wonderful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle? Yet they demand another Miracle to make this good. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That obſtinate Infidelity will not be ſatisfied with the moſt ſufficient means for Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſtill object, and oppoſe againſt the cleareſt, the fulleſt, and moſt convincing Evidence. <hi>What ſign ſheweſt thou us?</hi> ſay the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they had ſo many Signs and Wonders daily before their Eyes. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> demanding a Sign, our Saviour grants them one; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to his Death and Reſurrection, to prove that he was the true Meſſiah. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up.</hi> That is, I know you will deſtroy this Temple of my Body by putting me to death, but I will raiſe my ſelf again from the Grave the third Day. Chriſt did not command them to deſtroy his Body, but only foretold that they would do it. <hi>Non eſt verbum Praecepti, ſed Praedictionis.</hi> Chriſt fore-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Paſſion and his Reſurrection. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That all our Saviour's Sufferings were fore-known unto him, were foretold by him; he would not prevent them, but willingly permitted them, and chearfully underwent them. <hi>Deſtroy ye this Temple. Note here,</hi> 1. The State and Dignity of Chriſt's holy Body. 'Tis a Temple. <hi>He ſpake of the Temple of his Body.</hi> The Saints Bodies are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by ſpecial Sanctification: Chriſt's Body was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Subſtantial Inhabitation. The Divinity of Chriſt dwelt in his Humanity, perſonally and immediately. God
<pb facs="tcp:46556:129"/> dwells in his Saints by Regal Authority, he dwelt in Chriſt's Humanity by perſonal Reſidence. <hi>Note</hi> 2. The Violence and Indignity offered to this holy Temple at our Saviour's Death; it was pulled down and <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> Death diſſolved the Union betwixt our Saviour's Soul and Body; but there was a cloſer Union which no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Death could diſſolve, namely, the Union of his Godhead with his Manhood. This was incapable either of Diſſolution or Deſtruction. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. The repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſtoring and raiſing up of this Temple out of the Ruins of it by our Saviour's Reſurrection. <hi>In three Days I will raiſe it up. Obſerve,</hi> A full Proof of our Saviour's Divinity. To raiſe a dead Man exceeds the Power of Nature, but for a dead Man to raiſe himſelf, requires the Power of God. We read of dead Men raiſed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but none but Chriſt ever raiſed himſelf. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not ſay, He raiſed others from the Grave, himſelf he could not raiſe. <hi>Inference</hi> 1. Was Chriſt's Body a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? ſo ſhould ours be too. Temples for the Holy God to dwell in. Temples by ſpecial Appropriation. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by ſolemn Conſecration. Temples by actual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <hi>If any Man defiles this Temple of God, him will God deſtroy.</hi> 2. Was the Temple of Chriſt's Body pulled down by death and deſtroyed? ſo muſt alſo the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Bodies ere long. The Temple of his Body was pulled down for our ſin, the Temple of our Bodies is ruined by our own ſin. Sin brought Mortality into our Natures and the Wages of our ſin is death. 3. Was the Temple of Chriſt's Body repaired in the Morning of the Reſurrection? ſo ſhall the Temple of our Bodies alſo, if we be the Members of Chriſt by a vital Union. <hi>Thy dead Men,</hi> Oh bleſſed Redeemer! <hi>ſhall live, together with thy dead Body ſhall they ariſe.

               <p n="23">23 ¶ Now when he was in Jeruſalem at the Paſſover, in the feaſt-<hi>day,</hi> many believed in his name, when they ſaw the miracles which he did. 24 But Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all men,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> what Influence the ſight of our Saviour's Miracles had upon many of the common People, <hi>They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his Name, when they ſaw the Miracles which he did.</hi> That is, they were convinced by the Works which our Saviour wrought, that he came from God, and that what he ſaid and did was really True, and no Impoſture. <hi>But Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all Men.</hi> Our Saviour did not, and would not truſt them who yet believed on his Name. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> That a naked Aſſent to the Hiſtory of the Goſpel is not ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to ſaving Faith. We may aſſent to the Truth of all that we find there, and yet be far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Saving Faith implies more than the Aſſent of the Underſtanding to the Truths of the Goſpel. We cannot believe or diſbelieve what we pleaſe, but muſt needs aſſent to what is evident to our Underſtanding; ſo that it is poſſible for a Man to aſſent to the Truth of Chriſtianity, and yet remain in a ſtate of Damnation; if he doth not embrace it as Good, as well as aſſent to it as True; if our Faith be not the Parent and Principle of Obedience, if our Belief doth not influence our Practice, though we paſs for Believers amongſt Men, we are no better than Unbelievers in the Account of Chriſt. If we believe Jeſus to be the True Meſſias, and do not receive him in all his Offices; if we commit our ſelves to his ſaving Mercy, but do not ſubmit our ſelves to his ruling Power; if we deſire him for our Saviour, but diſown him for our Sovereign; if we expect Salvation by him, and do not yield Subjection to him: we put a Cheat upon our ſelves, for he only believes as he ſhould, that lives as he does believe.</p>
               <p n="25">25 And needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi>'s deſign in the writing of this Goſpel, being to aſſert the Divinity of Chriſt, he ſcatters Evidences of it in almoſt every Chapter. Here he declares his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciency. He knew what was in Man; that is, being God bleſſed for ever, he had an exact Knowledge of the Hearts of Men, not by any Revelation of Men's Hearts from God; but by immediate Intuitition from himſelf he knows all Men, and all that is in Men.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p n="1">1 THere was a man of the Phariſees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 The ſame came to Jeſus by night, and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doſt, except God be with him.</p>
               <p>The former part of this Chapter acquaints us with that famous Conference which our bleſſed Saviour had with <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> This Man was by Sect a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Perſon ſeparated and ſet a-part for the ſtudy of the Law of God, and to teach it unto others, and by Calling or Profeſſion a <hi>Ruler of the Jews,</hi> that is, probably one of the Jewiſh Sanhedrim: A chief Perſon in their Eccleſiaſtical Court and Council. Conſider we <hi>Nicodemus</hi> firſt as a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> which ſort of Men were filled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Prejudice and Enmity againſt Chriſt, yet from hence we may gather, that ſuch is the Efficacy of Divine Grace, that it ſometimes convinces and converts alſo thoſe that are the greateſt Enemies to Chriſt and the fierceſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of him. No ſuch bitter Enemies to Chriſt as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> yet behold <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a <hi>Phariſee</hi> coming to him, convinced and converted by him. Conſider him, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a Ruler of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a Perſon of Place and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, making a Figure in the World. Though they were generally the Poor which followed Chriſt, yet ſome of the Great and Rich Men of the World, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Maſter of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> an Honourable Counſellor, are called to Chriſt and received by him, leſt if he had admitted illiterate and ſimple Men <hi>only,</hi> the World might have thought that they were deceived thro' their Simplicity. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The Time when <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to Chriſt, it was <hi>by Night,</hi> partly out of Shame, leſt the World ſhould think that ſuch a knowing Man as he was, wanted Inſtruction; and partly out of Fear, he had ſomething to loſe, and therefore durſt not own Chriſt publickly. However, our dear Lord upbraids him not with his Timerouſneſs, but graciouſly condeſcends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in the Fundamental Principle of Chriſtianity, the great Doctrine of Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Verily verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Chriſt here acquaints <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and in him all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that there muſt be a Change from Nature to Grace, before there can be a Change from Grace to Glory; for tho' he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> a Doctor, and one that had good Thoughts of Chriſt, looking upon him as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Perſon, one that had received Power from God to work Miracles, yet Chriſt aſſures him, that nothing ſhort of the regenerating Change would bring him to Heaven; 'tis not enough that we be new-dreſs'd, but we muſt be new-made, that is, thoroughly and univerſally changed, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by Illumination, the Will by Renovation, the Affections by Sanctification, the Life by Reformation, or we can never come at Heaven. We muſt be like God, or we can never live with him: If we be not like him in the Temper of our Minds on Earth, we can never be happy in the Enjoyment of him in Heaven; for Heaven which is a place of the greateſt Holineſs, would be a place of the greateſt Uneaſineſs to an unregenerate and unholy perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb and be born?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:130"/>
               <p>Two things are obſervable in this Queſtion of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, How can a Man be born when he is old?</hi> 1. His Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Weakneſs in propounding of ſuch a Queſtion. So true is that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> What a groſs Conception had this learned Man of the Notion of Regeneration? How ignorant is Nature of the Workings of Grace? 2. Yet in this Queſtion of his there is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a great deal of Plainneſs and Simplicity: He did not come as uſually the Phariſees did, with an inſnaring Queſtion in his Mouth, but with a Mind fairly diſpoſed for Information and Conviction; with a pious deſire to be inſtructed. Whatever Ignorance we labour under, it is ſafeſt and beſt to diſcover it to our Spiritual Guide, that we may attain the Mercy of ſaving Knowledge, but how many had rather carry their Ignorance to Hell with them, then diſcover it to their Miniſter?</p>
               <p n="5">5 Jeſus anſwered, Verily verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> not rightly underſtanding Chriſt's meaning in the former Verſe, our Saviour is pleaſed to explain himſelf in this, and tells him that the Birth he ſpake of, was not Natural, but Spiritual, wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God, whoſe Working is like Water, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and purifying the Soul from all ſinful Defilement. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the regenerating Change is wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God, which purifies it from its Natural Defilement, and renews it after the Divine Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Image.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, As Men generate Men, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture begets Nature, ſo the Holy Spirit produceth Holy Inclinations, Qualifications and Diſpoſitions. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That as Original Corruption is conveighed by Natural Generation, ſo Saving Regeneration is the Effect and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Holy Spirit's Operation.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Marvel not that I ſay unto thee, Ye muſt be born again. 8 The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> making an Exception againſt our Saviour's Notion of Regeneration from the Abſurdity and Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it (as he thought) our Saviour therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to clear the Matter, by a Similitude taken from the Wind, which at once declares the Author and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Manner of Spiritual Regeneration: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it is the Holy Spirit of God, compared to the Wind, firſt for the Quality of its Motion, <hi>It blows when and where it liſteth.</hi> Secondly, From the Senſibleneſs of its Effects, <hi>Thou heareſt the ſound thereof.</hi> Thirdly, From the Intricacy or Myſteriouſneſs of its Proceedings, <hi>Thou knoweſt not whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.</hi> As the Natural Wind is not under the Power of Man, either to ſend it out, or to reſtrain it, It bloweth where it liſteth for all us, though not where it liſteth in regard of God. In like manner, the Holy Spirit is as Wind in the freeneſs of its Motion, and in the Variableneſs of its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Way and Work of the Holy Spirit of God in the Soul's Regeneration, it is oft-times very ſecret and uſually exceeding Various. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as to the time: Some are wrought upon in Youth, others in old Age. Various in his Methods of Working. Some are wrought upon by the Corroſives of the Law, others by the Lenitives of the Goſpel. Various in the Manner of his Working, and in the Means by which he works. Upon ſome by a powerful Ordinance, upon others by an awakening Providence. But though there be ſuch Variety in the Method of the Spirit's Working, yet is the Work in all ſtill the ſame. There is no Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in the Work wrought. The effect produced by the Holy Spirit in the Work of Regeneration is alike and the ſame in all, namely, Likeneſs to God; A Conformity in our Natures to the Holy Nature of God, and a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in our Lives to the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be? 10 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Art thou a Maſter of Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things? 11 Verily verily I ſay unto thee, We ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen; and ye receive not our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>

Learn hence,</hi> That the great Cauſe of Mens Ignorance in the Matters of Salvation and the Myſteries of Religion, is conſulting their own Natural Reaſon, without ſubmitting their Underſtandings to the Authority of Divine Revelation. Till they can give a Reaſon for every thing they believe, they cry out with <hi>Nicodemus, How can theſe things be?</hi> whereas though we cannot give a reaſon of all Goſpel Myſteries which we believe, we can give a good reaſon why we believe them, namely, Becauſe God has revealed them. No Man can be a Chriſtian who refuſes to ſubmit his Underſtanding to the Authority of Divine Revelation. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 2. How our Saviour reproves <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for, and upbraids him with his Ignorance, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and his Infidelity, <hi>v.</hi> 12. 1. His Ignorance is reproved. <hi>Art thou a Maſter of Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, Ignorance in any as to the Fundamentals of Religion is ſhameful, tho' but a common Learner, much more in a Teacher and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and he a Teacher and Maſter in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> now art thou one of them, and yet knoweſt not theſe things? <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That a Man may be very knowing himſelf and take upon him to teach and inſtruct others, and yet be very ignorant of the Nature, and much unacquainted with the Work of Regeneration upon his own Soul. A Man may be ſharp-ſighted as the Eagle in the Myſteries of Art and Nature, and yet blind as a Mole in the things of God. 2. That Ignorance, in the Fundamentals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſpecially, is very culpable and ſhameful in any that enjoy the means of Knowledge, but eſpecially in thoſe that undertake to teach and inſtruct others. <hi>Art thou a Teacher, thou a Maſter of Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> Next our Saviour upbraids him for his Infidelity, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not.</hi> This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity received its Aggravation from the Facility and Perſpicuity of our Saviour's Doctrine. I have told you earthly Things, that is, I have ſet forth Spiritual Things, by Earthly Similitudes; not in a Stile ſuitable to the Sublimity of their own Nature. Let the Miniſters of Chriſt learn from their Maſter's Example, in all their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoures to accommodate themſelves and deſcend as low as may be to the Capacities of their People. <hi>I have told you earthly things.</hi> 2. That even Spiritual Things when they are ſhadowed forth by earthly Similitudes and brought down in the plaineſt manner to the Capacities of our People, yet are they very ſlow to underſtand them, and very backward to believe them. <hi>I have told you of earthly things, and ye believe them not.</hi>

               <p n="13">13 And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <hi>even</hi> the ſon of man which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour declares to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſcended up into Heaven, to fetch down from thence the Knowledge of Divine Myſteries. And to reveal the Way of Life and Salvation to Mankind by a Mediator, but only Chriſt himſelf, who tho' he took upon him the human Nature and was then Man upon Earth, yet was he at the ſame time in his Divine Nature actually in heaven as God. This Text evidently proves two diſtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> namely, a Divine Nature as he was God, and an Humane Nature as Man. In his Humane Nature, he was then upon Earth, when he ſpake theſe Words; in
<pb facs="tcp:46556:130"/> his Divine Nature he was at that Inſtant in Heaven. <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> That the Son of God hath taken the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into ſo cloſe and intimate an Union with his God-head, that what is proper to either Nature is aſcribed unto the Perſon of our Saviour. The ſame Perſon who was on Earth as the Son of Man, was then in Heaven as God, and yet but one Perſon ſtill. Lord! what Love haſt thou ſhewen to our Humane Nature, that under that Name thou aſcribeſt to thy ſelf what is proper to thy God-head. <hi>The Son of Man which is in Heaven.</hi>

               <p n="14">14 ¶ And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the ſon of man be lifted up: 15 That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</p>
               <p>Chriſt having inſtructed <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the Doctrine of Regeneration in the former Verſes, here he inſtructs him in the Death of the Meſſiah, and in the Neceſſity of Faith in his Death. <hi>The Son of Man muſt be lifted up;</hi> that is, upon his Croſs, and dye; <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh. Obſerve here,</hi> 1. An Old Teſtament Type which our Saviour refers to, and that is the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Wilderneſs, the Hiſtory of which is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.7, 8. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Antitype, or the Subſtance of what that Type did ſhadow forth, the Brazen Serpent's lifting up upon the Pole, prefiguring Chriſt's Exaltation or lifting up upon his Croſs. <hi>So muſt the Son of Man be lifted up. Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is of the ſame Uſe and Office to a Sin-ſtung Soul, which the Brazen Serpent was of old to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent-ſtung <hi>Iſraelite. Here obſerve,</hi> Firſt, Wherein the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent and Chriſt do agree. And Secondly, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ. They agree thus, In the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of their <hi>Inſtitution;</hi> they were both appointed for Cure and Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Were they Serpent-ſtung? We are Sin-ſtung; Devil-bitten: Was the Sting of the fiery Serpents infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? Was it ſpreading? Was it killing? So is ſin, which is the Venom and Poiſon of the old Serpent. They agree in this, that they both muſt be <hi>lifted up</hi> before Cure could be obtained; the Brazen Serpent upon the Pole; Chriſt upon his Croſs: They both muſt be <hi>lookt unto</hi> before Cure could be obtained. The looking up of the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was as neceſſary unto Healing as the lifting up of the Serpent. Faith is as neceſſary to Salvation, as the Death of Chriſt. The one rendered God reconcilable unto Sinners, the other renders him actually reconciled. Again, did the Brazen Serpent heal <hi>All</hi> that lookt upon it, and lookt up unto it, though all had not Eyes alike, ſome with a weak, others with a ſtronger Eye? In like manner doth Chriſt juſtifie and ſave <hi>All,</hi> that with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith, though weak, do rely upon him for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Whoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh.</hi> Further, the Brazen Serpent was effectual for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Cure after many Stingings; if after they were healed, they were ſtung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and did look up to it, they were healed by it. Thus the Merit of Chriſt's Death is not only effectual for our Cure and Healing at our firſt Converſion, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter involuntary Relapſes and Backſlidings, if by Faith we have recourſe to the Blood of Chriſt, we ſhall find it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious for our farther Benefit and future Healing. In a Word, as the Brazen Serpent had the <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of a Serpent, the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Figure,</hi> the <hi>Name,</hi> the <hi>Colour</hi> of a Serpent, but nothing of the Venom and Poiſon of the Serpent in it. Thus Chriſt did take upon him our Natures; but ſin, the Venom and Poiſon of our Natures he had nothing to do with; though Chriſt loved Souls with an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inſuperable Love, yet he would not ſin to ſave a Soul. This was the Similitude and Reſemblance between Chriſt and the Brazen Serpent. The Diſparity or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude follows. The Brazen Serpent had no Power in its ſelf or of its ſelf to heal and cure, but Chriſt has a Power inherent in himſelf for the Cure and Healing of all that do believe in him. Again, the Brazen Serpent cured only one particular Nation and People, <hi>Jews</hi> only. Chriſt is for the healing of all Nations, and his Salvation is to the ends of the Earth. Farther, the Brazen Serpent cured only one particular Diſeaſe, namely, the Stingings of the fiery Serpents; had a Perſon been ſick of the Plague or Leproſie, he might have died for all the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent. But Chriſt pardons all the Iniquities and heals all the Diſeaſes of his People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. Yet again, though the Brazen Serpent healed all that lookt up unto it, yet it gave an Eye to none to look up unto it: Whereas Chriſt doth not only heal thoſe that look up to him, but beſtows the Eye of Faith upon them to enable them to look unto him that they may be ſaved. In a Word, the Brazen Serpent did not always retain its heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue, but in time loſt it, and was it ſelf deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. But now the healing Vertue and Efficacy of Chriſt's Blood is Eternal. All Believers have and ſhall experience the healing Power of our Redeemer's Death to the end of the World. Laſtly, The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were cured by looking up to the brazen Serpent, dyed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; ſome Diſtemper or other ſoon carried them to their Graves; but the Soul of the Believer that is healed by Chriſt, ſhall never dye more; <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have eternal Life.</hi>

                  <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1.

               <p>In theſe Words our Saviour acquaints us with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature of Sin and Holineſs. It is the Nature of Sin and the Property of Sinners to hate the Light, becauſe it diſcovers the Evil and Sinfulneſs of their Ways unto them and condemns them for them; as the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are ſaid to curſe the Sun for its bright and hot ſhining; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as holy and gracious Perſons, that walk uprightly, do love the Light; that is, they delight to have their Thoughts, Words and Actions, tried by the Light of the Word, becauſe <hi>they are wrought in God;</hi> that is, performed as in the ſight of God. According to the Direction of the VVord of God, and with a ſingle Eye and ſincere Aim at the Glory of <hi>God. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Word of God, or the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, it has all the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Great and True Light. It is of a pure and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Nature, it is manifeſtative, and of a diſcovering Nature. It has a piercing Power and penetrating Vertue. It enters the darkeſt Receſſes of the Soul, and detects the Errors of Mens Judgments, as well as diſcovers the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities of their Lives. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That nothing is ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to, and hated by a wicked Man, as the diſcovering and reproving Light of the Word of God; for at the ſame time that it diſcovers the ſin, it condemns the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3. That a truly gracious Perſon, who acteth agreeably to the Will of God, is not afraid to examine his Actions by the VVord of God; but deſires and delights that what he does may be made manifeſt both to God and Man. <hi>He that doth Truth cometh to the Light,</hi> and rejoyceth <hi>that his Deeds may be made manifeſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>they are wrought in God.</hi>

               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having now finiſhed his excellent Sermon, preached to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he departs thence with his Diſciples into the Country of <hi>Judea</hi> to make Proſelytes by the Ordinance of Baptiſm.

Which cauſes them to look upon the exalted Parts and Gifts of Others, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution and debaſing of their own; but why ſhould the proſpering of the Work of God in one Miniſters Hand, be Matter of repining unto others? ſhall not God honour what Inſtruments he pleaſeth? and will he not reward all his faithful Labourers, according to their Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not according to their Succeſs?</p>

He tells them Chriſt was the Maſter, <hi>John</hi> but his Miniſter; and that he had told them ſo from the beginning; <hi>Ye your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt: but ſent before him.</hi> The faithful Miniſters of Chriſt think it honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be Servants to him, and would not have their Followers attribute the leaſt part of that honour and glory to him, which is due to Jeſus Chriſt. 2. <hi>John</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints his Diſciples that Chriſt was the Bridegroom of his Church, to whom the Chriſtian Church was to be ſolemnly eſpouſed and married; and that he had honour enough in being one of the Bridegroom's Friends and Servants; and accordingly inſtead of envying, he rejoyced at the Succeſs which the Bridegroom had, and took great pleaſure in it. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Relation betwixt Chriſt and his Church, is a Conjugal Relation, a Relation of Marriage; yet ſet forth under the Name of Bride and Bridegroom, rather than under the Notion of a compleat Marriage, becauſe it is but begun here, and to be conſummate in Heaven; and alſo to ſhew that Chriſt's and his People's Affections are as warm and freſh, as ſtrong and vehement each towards other, as the Affections of eſpouſed or newly-married Perſons are to one another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. <hi>As the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee. Learn,</hi> 2. It is honour ſufficient to the Miniſters of Chriſt that they as Friends of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom are imployed by him to farther the Marriage-Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt him and his Spouſe. Their Office is to woe for Chriſt, to commend his Perſon, and to invite all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to accept of him for their Head and Husband, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt. Learn,</hi> 3. That there is no greater Joy to the Miniſters of Chriſt, than to ſee themſelves honoured by him, as his Inſtruments in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a People for Chriſt, and happily uniting them unto him. Oh! how little do our People know, and leſs conſider, how much of the Comfort of their poor Miniſters Lives lies at their Mercy: We live as we ſee any of them ſtand faſt in the Lord. We die as we ſee others ſtick faſt in their Sins. This was the ſecond Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which <hi>John</hi> acquaints his Diſciples was found betwixt Chriſt and himſelf. The third follows, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe:</hi> He muſt increaſe; that is, in Honour and Dignity, in Eſteem and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Diſcovery, and Manifeſtation. He ſhall ſhine forth as the riſing Sun, and I muſt diſappear like the morning Star. Not that <hi>John</hi>'s Light was diminiſhed, but by a greater Light obſcured only: As all the Stars diſappear at the appearance of the Sun. Yet obſerve what matter of Joy it was to <hi>John</hi> to ſee himſelf out-ſhined by Chriſt: Let him increaſe, tho' I decreaſe. That Miniſter has true Light in himſelf, that can Rejoyce when he is out-ſhined by others: Who is content to be abaſed and obſcured, if he may but ſee Chriſt dignified and exalted in the Lives of his People, whoever the Perſon is, whom God honours as his Inſtrument in that Service. The fourth Difference wherein Chriſt excels <hi>John</hi> and all his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is in the Divine Original of his Perſon, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>He that cometh from above, is above all,</hi> ſays <hi>John.</hi> Now Chriſt is from above, his Original is from Heaven; I am from the Earth (tho' I had my Commiſſion from Heaven) and accordingly my Words and Actions are Earthly. My <hi>Maſter</hi> therefore infinitely ſurpaſſeth and excels me in the Dignity of his Perſon, and in the Sublimity of his Knowledge. From the whole, <hi>Note,</hi> How much it is the Deſire and Endeavour of every Goſpel-Miniſter to magnifie Jeſus Chriſt, to diſplay his glorious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Perfections before their People, that they may reverence his Perſon, revere his Authority, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his Laws. This was the Care of the Holy Baptiſt here, and it will be the Endeavour of every faithful Miniſter of Chriſt that ſucceeds <hi>John</hi> to the end of the World.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. Another great Difference which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt teacheth his Diſciples to put betwixt his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Chriſt's: To the intent that he might remove the Prejudice which was upon his Diſciples Mind againſt the Meſſiah, he ſhews them that his own Teſtimony (which they ſo much admired) was by Revelation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Chriſt's by immediate Intuition. <hi>John</hi> teſtified only what he had received; but Chriſt, what he had ſeen; lying in the Boſom of the Father. <hi>What he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth. Learn hence,</hi> That it is Chriſt's (the great Prophet of his Church) peculiar Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to have the knowledge of Divine Truths imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Father by ſpecial Communication; and that all others receive their Knowledge from him by gracious Illumination only. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſorrowfully the holy Baptiſt reſents it, that Chriſt's Teſtimony was no better received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the World. <hi>He teſtifieth, but no Man receiveth his teſtimony. John</hi>'s Diſciples murmured <hi>that all Men came unto Chriſt,</hi> v. 26. but <hi>John</hi> mourns that there came no more, and complains that none, that is, very few <hi>received his Teſtimony. Thence learn,</hi> That it ought and will be matter of great Regret and Sorrow to all the Friends of Jeſus Chriſt, but eſpecially to his faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Servants, that his Doctrine is ſo ill received and entertained in the World. It greatly affects and grievouſly afflicts them, that when they <hi>teſtifie of Chriſt, no Man,</hi> that is, comparatively, very few Men, <hi>receive their Teſtimony. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Eulogy and high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation given of all true Believers; <hi>they receive Chriſt's Teſtimony,</hi> and thereby <hi>ſet to their Seal that God is true;</hi> that is, hath ſubſcribed to, and ratified the Truth of God, that God in all his Promiſes of the Meſſiah, under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> is faithful and true. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> The great Honour that God puts upon the Faith of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: As Unbelief defames God and makes him a Lyer, ſo Faith gives Teſtimony to the Truth of God, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth its Seal that God is true; <hi>He that receiveth his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, hath ſet to his Seal that God is true. Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Illuſtrious Character which the Holy Baptiſt gives of Chriſt his Maſter; he is the Perſon <hi>whom God hath ſent,</hi> and unto whom <hi>God giveth not his Spirit by meaſure. He whom God has ſent,</hi> that is, immediately and extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Heaven; not as the Prophets and Apoſtles were ſent, but in a way peculiar to himſelf: Having Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for ſpeaking, not only from God, but as being God himſelf. And accordingly it is added, that <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him;</hi> that is, the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit were poured forth upon Chriſt in a Meaſure far above and beyond all finite Creatures: There being a double difference betwixt Chriſt's fulneſs of the Spirit, and all other Perſons whatſoever. 1. In the Meaſure of it: God did not give out the Spirit to Chriſt ſparingly, and with limitation, as he did to the former Prophets and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, in proportion to what their Offices required, but he was anointed more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and abundantly with the Holy Spirit above and beyond his Fellows. 2. In the manner of its working. The holy Prophets that were filled with the Spirit (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Meaſures) yet could not do or declare all Things, nor act upon all Occaſions, but ſometimes the Spirit reſtrained them, and ſometimes departed from them. But Chriſt had no limits put upon the Vigour of his Spirit, but his own Will; therefore could work what and when he pleaſed. <hi>Learn from hence,</hi> That Chriſt had an abundant fitneſs from God for the diſcharge of his Office, and an abundant fulneſs for his People. God did not meaſure to him a certain Quantity and Proportion of the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit, but pour'd it forth upon him without Meaſure.</p>
               <p n="35">35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all things into his hand.</p>
               <p>The Father loveth the Son from Eternity, as he was his Son by eternal Generation; and he loved him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb facs="tcp:46556:132"/> by ſpecial Conſtitution; he loves him as the Brightneſs of his own Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, with an Eſſential, Natural and Neceſſary Love. And he loves him as Mediator, for undertaking our Cauſe and interpoſing for our Peace. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That God the Father had a ſpecial Love and Affection to Chriſt, not only in regard of his Eternal Sonſhip, but with reſpect to his Office of Mediatorſhip; <hi>The Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Son.</hi> It follows, <hi>he hath given all things into his hand;</hi> that is, intruſted him with all things neceſſary to our Salvation. Lord! what a Privilege is this, that our Happineſs is in Chriſt's Hand, not in our own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his. Oh, wonderful Goodneſs, to put our Concerns into the ſure Hands of his Son, which were loſt by the weak Hands of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36 He that believeth on the Son, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That tho' all Power be given to Chriſt, to diſpenſe Grace here and Glory hereafter, yet none muſt expect to enjoy it but upon Condition of believing in him, and obeying of him: For the Original Word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies both. No Faith is acceptable to Chriſt, nor availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our Salvation, but that which is the Parent and Principle of Obedience. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That final Unbelief renders a Man infallibly an Object of the Eternal Wrath of God; <hi>He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on him.</hi> The Unbeliever now lies under the Sentence of God's Wrath, hereafter he ſhall lie under the full and final execution of it. Lord! how ſad is it to be here in a ſtate of Condemnation! But how intollerable will it be in Hell, to continue eternally under the Power of Condemnation? To lie for ever in that myſterious Fire of Hell, whoſe ſtrange property it is always to torture, but never to kill; or, always to kill, but never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume: For after Millions of Years are expired, ſtill 'tis a Wrath to come; and tho' the Unbeliever has felt and endured never ſo much, yet ſtill <hi>the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 WHen therefore the Lord knew how the Phariſees had heard that Jeſus made and baptized mo diſciples then John, 2 (Though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but <hi>his</hi> diſciples) 3 He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
               <p>The former part of this Chapter acquaints us with our Saviour's removal from <hi>Judea</hi> into <hi>Galilee:</hi> The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it was this: Chriſt hearing that <hi>John</hi> was caſt into Priſon, and underſtanding how the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were inraged at the increaſing of the Number of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; to decline their Fury, and to prevent Danger to himſelf, he leaves <hi>Judea</hi> and departs into <hi>Galilee,</hi> for his own Preſervation. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That when the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt do meet with eminent Succeſs in their Maſter's Service, they muſt expect to meet with a mighty ſhock of Malice and Envy from Satan and his wicked Inſtruments. Chriſt himſelf experienced it, let his Miniſters expect it and prepare for it. 2. That it is neither unlawful nor unbecoming for the Miniſters of Chriſt to flee when Perſecution threatens them: Their Lord and Maſter having fled before them: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded alſo, <hi>when they perſecute in one City, to flee into another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 And he muſt needs go through Samaria. 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his ſon Joſeph. 6 Now Jacobs well was there. Jeſus therefore being wearied with his journey, ſat thus on the well; and it was about the ſixth hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. How wonderfully the Wiſdom of God over-rules the Malice of Men, for his own Glory and the Good of others. The Malice of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> drives Chriſt into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and in his Paſſage through <hi>Samaria,</hi> the firſt Fruits of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called; and, particularly the Woman of <hi>Samaria. Obſerve,</hi> 2. How in every ſtep of Chriſt's way he was doing good to the Souls of Men. In his Paſſage through <hi>Samaria</hi> into <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> a poor Woman is brought to know him to be the true Meſſias. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. Our Holy Lord in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying from Place to Place, did travel uſually on foot; and the wearkneſs of his Body upon travelling, ſhews him to be truly and really Man, <hi>and in all things like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, Sin only excepted.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord did not only take upon him our Nature, but the Infirmities of our Nature alſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Give me to drink. 8 For his diſciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat. 9 Then ſaith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew, askeſt drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How all our own Motions and Actions are under the Direction and Government of God, and how Divine Providence doth ſometimes diſpoſe of ſmall Matters to become Occaſions of great Good. This poor Woman's coming to the Well to draw Water, became the means of her Converſion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Chriſt ſpeaks to, and ſeeks after this poor Woman, before ſhe takes any Notice of him; God is found of thoſe that ſeek him not, and makes himſelf manifeſt to them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not after him. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, Give me Drink. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The great Poverty of our Lord's outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he wanted a draught of Water for his Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a meals Meat now at Dinner-time to refreſh his wearied Nature. Oh! what Contempt did Chriſt caſt upon the World when he was here in it? He would not honour it ſo far as to keep any Part of it in his own hand. <hi>Yet Obſerve,</hi> 4. That tho' Chriſt had neither Houſe, nor Land, nor Money of his own, yet he lived not by Begging, or upon meer Alms. <hi>The Diſciples were now gone into the City to buy,</hi> not to <hi>beg Meat.</hi> For there was a Bag which required a Bearer, <hi>John</hi> 12.6. and our Saviour's Friends and Followers ſupplied him with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for his neceſſary Occaſions. <hi>His Diſciples were gone to buy Bread. Obſerve, Laſtly,</hi> How bitter is the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which differences in Religion and diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions do occaſion? They do not only alienate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but even violate the Bonds of civil Society and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Converſation. <hi>The Jews had no dealings with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> would neither eat nor drink with them.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
               <p>The Samaritan Woman had refuſed Chriſt a draught of Water in the former Verſe, he offers her the Water of Life in this Verſe. Oh, how kindly doth Chriſt deal with thoſe that dealt unkindly with him? <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Mercy which Chriſt had for, and was ſo deſirous to beſtow upon this poor Woman; it was the Gift of God; that is, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Holy Spirit, in the ſanctifying Gifts and ſaving Graces of it: All which are compared to Water in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Effects and Operations, which are to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Unclean, and to ſatisfie the Thirſty. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The way and courſe which this Woman and every loſt Sinner ought to take, in order to the obtaining of this ineſtimable Gift; and that is, by asking of it. <hi>Thou wouldſt have asked, and he would have given thee living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt himſelf, his Holy Spirit, with all the ſanctifying Graces of it, muſt be earneſtly ſought of God; and ſuch as do unfeignedly ſeek them,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:132"/> ſhall certainly obtain them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The true Cauſe and Reaſon aſſigned why Sinners ask not for, and ſeek not after Jeſus Chriſt, and the Graces of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and that is Ignorance of the worth and want of them. <hi>If thou knoweſt the gift of God, thou wouldſt have asked. Learn thence,</hi> That it is Ignorance of the worth of Chriſt, and inſenſibleneſs of the want of him, that makes Perſons ſo indifferent in their Deſires after him, and ſo remiſs in their Endeavours for the obtaining of him.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then haſt thou that living water? 12 Art thou greater then our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his children, and his cattel? 13 Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water ſhall thirſt again: 14 But whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt: but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How ignorant Perſons are of ſpiritual things, till enlightned by the Holy Spirit of God. This poor Womans Queſtion, <hi>Whence haſt thou that living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> looks much like that of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John 3.9. <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> A natural Perſon cannot perceive the Mind of Chriſt when ſpeaking to them about ſpiritual things. Spiritual Objects muſt have a ſpiritual Eye to diſcern and behold them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit. Obſerve,</hi> 2. With what great Humility and Condeſcenſion our Holy Lord treats this poor Woman, pitying her Ignorance, and pardoning her Infidelity: He tells her, That the Water of that Well which ſhe was about to draw, could not give an abiding Satisfaction; but the Thirſt quenched for the preſent, would certainly return again: But he that ſhould drink of the Water which he had to give, that is, be made partakers of the Graces of his Spirit, ſhall find ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſatisfaction therefrom, that all inordinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after earthly things will be quench'd and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, and will be like a Well of Water ſpringing up till they come to Eternal Glory. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That as the Body of Man is ſubject to natural, ſo is the Soul of Man ſubject to a ſpiritual kind of Thirſt. 2. That no Creature-Comfort, or earthly Enjoyment can quench this Thirſt, which the Soul of Man is ſubject unto. 3. That the Spirit of Grace (which our Saviour here calls <hi>the Water of Life</hi>) is able fully and perfectly to quench this Thirſt of the Soul: And where it is once ſavingly received, ſhall never be totally or finally loſt. <hi>It ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirſt not, neither come hither to draw. 16 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 17 The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man anſwered and ſaid, I have no husband. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid unto her, Thou haſt well ſaid, I have no husband: 18 For thou haſt had five huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and he whom thou now haſt is not thy husband: in that ſaidſt thou truly.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words ſet forth unto us, 1. What manner of Perſon this Woman was, whoſe Converſion Chriſt ſought ſo induſtriouſly after. 2. The Means he uſed in order to that End. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. What manner of Perſon this Woman was; beſides, that ſhe was an Idolater, as being a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> ſhe was alſo an Adultereſs, and lived now in the Sin of Uncleanneſs with one that was not her Husband, after ſhe had had five Husbands before. <hi>Whence we learn,</hi> That the ice of old Age will not quench the Fire of Luſt, <hi>Concupiſcentia non ſeneſcit;</hi> ſuch is the Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our Nature, that Luſt will be inſatiable if Grace doth not reſtrain it. This Woman, after five Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, yet lives in the Sin of Uncleanneſs. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Way and Manner our Lord takes, the Method and Means our Lord uſes in order to her Converſion. 1. He deals very tenderly and gently with her, he uſes no roughneſs or tartneſs of Speech with her, he doth not call her Whore, nor upbraid her for her impudent Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in living with a Man that was none of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but only gives her to underſtand that he knew the Sin ſhe lived in; yet this he did likewiſe with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable privacy, whilſt his Diſciples were away, and no Body by, but they two only. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sins are not to be reproved publickly. 2. That in reproving Sin, all ſharpneſs and bitterneſs of Expreſſion muſt be avoided: The Pill of Reproof muſt be rapp'd up in Sugar; for if they to whom it is given taſte the bitterneſs of Gall and Paſſion mixt with it, they will certainly ſpit it out before, it may be, upon our Faces. Our Lord's Practcie here inſtructs us, That Sin is to be ſo reproved, as that the Credit and Eſtimation of the Sinner may be preſerved as much as may be. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That as Chriſt dealt with this Woman tenderly and gently, ſo he diſcovers her Sin to her particularly, and ſets her ſecret Sin before the Face of her Conſcience di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. If ever the Miniſtry of the Word works upon the Minds of Men to their Converſion, it muſt be by a particular and cloſe application of the Word to every Man's Conſcience. Generals will not affect. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. What the particular Sin is which Chriſt charges home upon the Conſcience of this Woman; it is the Sin of Uncleanneſs, that the Man ſhe kept with, was not her Husband. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That amongſt all Sins, the ſin of Uncleanneſs will lie heavieſt upon the Conſcience, and wound the Soul moſt deeply, when the Spirit of God once effectually diſcovers it, and charges it home upon the Conſcience: For there is no Sin ſo directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Sanctification and Holineſs as this Sin: No Sin that quenches the Holy Spirit of God like this Sin.</p>
               <p n="19">19 The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 20 Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain; and ye ſay, that in Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to worſhip.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes the Evangeliſt declares a threefold Effect and Fruit of the Grace of Converſion that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Woman. 1. She neither denied, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, nor extenuated the Sin which Chriſt had charged her with; but tacitly owns and implicitly confeſſes it. 2. She doth not only own and confeſs what ſhe was charged with, but ſhe doth profeſs Reverence to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Perſon, and pays Honour to him as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophet; <hi>Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet.</hi> 3. She deſireth Inſtruction and Reſolution from him concerning the Worſhip and Service of the true God, how ſhe might ſeek him, and where ſhe might ſerve him moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; whether at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or upon Mount <hi>Gerizim: Our Fathers worſhipped in this Mountain; but ye ſay, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem is the place where Men ought to worſhip. Where Obſerve,</hi> How ready and forward Perſons of a falſe Religion are to aſcribe too much to Antiquity, and to the Example and cuſtom of their Fore-Fathers. Whereas it is not the continuance of a thouſand or two thouſand Years that can make any thing truly Ancient in Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it has been from the beginning: Nothing is truly Ancient in Matters of Religion, but that which can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Original from him that is truly called the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father. 22 Ye worſhip ye know not what: we know what we worſhip: for ſalvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour cometh and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth: for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:133"/>
               <p>Here we have our Saviour's Anſwer to the foregoing Queſtion, which conſiſts of two Parts; 1. Concerning the Place of Worſhip. 2. Concerning the Worſhip it ſelf. As to the Place of Worſhip, our Saviour tells her, that though the <hi>Jews</hi> had heretofore by warrant of God's Word regularly worſhipped at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> ſuperſtitiouſly worſhipped at Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> yet the Hour was coming, namely, at his Death, when all difference of Places for God's Worſhip ſhould be taken away, and therefore ſhe need not trouble her ſelf about the Place of God's Worſhip, to know whether of the two Places were holier, and the better to ſerve God in; for ere long the Service of <hi>God</hi> ſhould not be confined more to one Place, than another. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That ſince the death of Chriſt, the Religious Difference of Places is taken away, and the Worſhip of God not confined to any one particular Place or Nation. 2. Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reſolves her concerning the Worſhip it ſelf, namely, that the Ceremonial Worſhip, which the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> uſed, ſhould ſhortly be aboliſhed, and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a more ſpiritual Form of Worſhip ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, more ſuitable to the Spiritual Nature of the great and holy God, and containing in it the Truth and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all that which the Jewiſh Ceremonies prefigured and ſhadowed forth. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the True Worſhip of God under the Goſpel, doth not conſiſt in the external Pomp of any outward Ceremonies, but is Spiritual and Subſtantial: No Worſhip is acceptable to him, that is the Father of Spirits, but that which is truly Spiritual.</p>
               <p n="24">24 God <hi>is</hi> a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip <hi>him</hi> in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is a Spirit;</hi> that is, he has no Body nor bodily Parts: He is not a bare ſpiritual Subſtance, but a pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Spirit, and therefore his Worſhippers <hi>muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth:</hi> Where Spirit is oppoſed to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Ceremonies, and Truth to the Jewiſh Rites, not to Hypocritical Services; for the old Patriarchs did worſhip God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi> As Truth is taken for <hi>Sincerity,</hi> they ſerved him with a ſincere Conſcience, and with a ſingle Heart. But our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Buſineſs is to ſhew, That a Worſhip without Legal Rites and Jewiſh Ceremonies, is proper to the times of the Goſpel. In the Words, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 1. The Nature of God declared. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> 2. The Duty of Man inferred; therefore <hi>they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> From the whole <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That God is a pure <hi>Spiritual Being.</hi> When bodily Parts, Hands and Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are aſcribed to him, it is only in Condeſcenſion to our weakneſs, and to ſignifie thoſe Acts in God which ſuch Members do perform in us. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That the Worſhip due from the Creature to God is ſpiritual Worſhip, and ought to be ſpiritually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The Jewiſh Ceremonial Worſhip was aboliſhed to promote the Spirituality of Divine Worſhip, yet muſt not this be ſo underſtood, as if God rejected bodily Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe he requires ſpiritual under the Gopſel; for Jeſus Chriſt the moſt ſpiritual Worſhipper, worſhipped God with his Body. Beſides, God has appointed ſome Parts of Worſhip, which cannot be performed without the Body, as Sacraments. In a Word, God has created the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Soul.</hi> Chriſt has redeemed the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Soul,</hi> and he will glorify the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Soul;</hi> therefore it is our Duty to worſhip and glorify God, with our Bodies and with our Spirits which are his.</p>
               <p n="25">25 The woman ſaith unto him, I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 26 Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith unto her, I that ſpeak unto thee, am <hi>he.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. What a General Expectation there was in the Minds of all Perſons (at the time of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s appearing) of one whom the <hi>Jews</hi> called the <hi>Meſſiah. I know that Meſſiah cometh.</hi> This Woman, though a <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> yet knew that the Meſſiah ſhould come, and that he was now expected. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. What the Work and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Meſſias was apprehended and believed to be, namely, to reveal the whole Mind and Will of God to a loſt World. <hi>When the Meſſias is come he will tell us all things. Learn thence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed and true Meſſias, being called and appointed by God to be the great Prophet of his Church, hath fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly revealed all things, needful to be known for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>All things that I have heard of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have made known unto you. Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> How free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully Chriſt reveals himſelf to this poor Woman, he tells her plainly, that he was the Meſſias. When the <hi>Jews</hi> asked him, <hi>John</hi> 10.24. <hi>If thou be the Chriſt tell us plainly,</hi> Chriſt did not in plain Terms tell them who he was. Nay, when <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt ſent two of his Diſciples to ask him whether he were <hi>He that ſhould come,</hi> he gave them no direct Anſwer: Yet behold he makes himſelf plainly known to this poor Woman, he diſcerning her Humility and great Simplicity, that ſhe was willing to be inſtructed by him, and did not come to him as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, captiouſly, with a deſign to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and enſpare him. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt delights to reveal himſelf and make known his Mind and Will to ſuch as with an humble Mind, and an honeſt Simplicity of heart do deſire to know him, and underſtand their Duty to him.</p>
               <p n="27">27 ¶ And upon this came his diſciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man ſaid, What ſeekeſt thou? or, Why talkeſt thou with her? 28 The woman then left her water-pot, and went her way into the city, and ſaith to the men, 29 Come, ſee a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Chriſt? 30 Then they went out of the city and came unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Providence of God ſo ordered and diſpoſed of things that the Diſciples did not return to Chriſt till he had finiſht his Diſcourſe with this poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. An humbled ſinner may meet with ſuch Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and ſweet Refreſhment in Chriſt's Company, that the preſence even of Diſciples themſelves (the beſt and holieſt of Saints) may be lookt upon as injurious to it, and an interruption of it. This poor Woman had ſo ſweet a time with Chriſt, that an end being put to the Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the coming of the Diſciples, might be Matter of Grief and Reſentment to her. Yet the Providence of God ſo ordered, that the Diſciples did not come to break off the Conference till Chriſt had made himſelf known as the Meſſias to this poor VVoman. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The Carriage and Behaviour of the Diſciples upon their return to Chriſt. Finding him preaching a Sermon to a ſingle VVoman, they marvelled, but yet were ſilent. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Condeſcenſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor penitent and humbled ſinners is matter of wonder and admiration, even to Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Oh bleſſed Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was more Kindneſs and Condeſcenſion, more Love and Compaſſion, more Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility in thy ſelf alone, than in all thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples and Followers put together. Yet <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Tho' they marvelled, they were ſilent, <hi>No Man ſaid, Why talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou with her? Thence Note,</hi> That ſuch Reverence is due to Chriſt in all his Diſpenſations and Actions, that when we can ſee no reaſon for what he doth, it is not for us to inquire, much leſs to quarrel: But we muſt awfully admire what we cannot comprehend. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 3. the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of this VVoman after the Conference was over, ſhe leaves her VVater-Pot, and makes haſte to invite and call her Neighbours to Chriſt, whoſe Grace and Kindneſs ſhe had experienced. <hi>Learn thence.</hi> That ſuch as truly know Chriſt, have taſted Sweetneſs in him, and derived Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Satisfaction from him, will be forward to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, and induſtrious to draw others to a ſaving Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him. <hi>Come</hi> with me, <hi>and ſee a Man that told me all that ever I did, is not this the Chriſt? Learn farther,</hi> from the Woman's leaving her Water-Pot behind her and haſtening to the City, That when once a Soul has taſted the Sweetneſs and Excellency that is in Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe things which were highly eſteemed before, will be little regarded then. The poor Woman came to draw Water, and thought much and ſpake much of the Water of that Well, which was before her; but meeting with Jeſus Chriſt, and taſting of his Grace, ſhe forgets both Water
<pb facs="tcp:46556:133"/> and Water-Pot, and away ſhe goes to fetch in all her Acquaintance to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="31">31 ¶ In the mean while his diſciples prayed him, ſaying, Maſter, eat. 32 But he ſaid unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 33 Therefore ſaid the Diſciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <hi>ought</hi> to eat? 34 Jeſus ſaith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The fit and ſeaſonable Motion which our Saviour's Diſciples make to him; <hi>Maſter, eat. Learn from thence,</hi> That though a Perſon's chief Care ſhould be for his own Soul, and for improving all Opportunities for doing good to the Souls of others, yet the Bodies of Men muſt not be neglected, but ſupported by Meat and Drink, eſpecially theirs whoſe Health and Strength may be of greater Uſe and Service to God and his Church. The Body is the Servant of the Soul, the Inſtrument whereby it worketh; and therefore to neglect the Body is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unfit the Soul for Service, to hinder the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Operations of it. The ſixth Commandment which forbids us to kill, requires us to uſe all Means for the Preſervation of Life both in our ſelves and others. <hi>Obſerve next,</hi> our Saviour's Anſwer to the Diſciples Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Maſter eat,</hi> ſay they: <hi>I have Meat to eat that ye know not of,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for my Meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> Not that our Saviour did not want Meat at this time, for he was both hungry and thirſty, as appears by his asking Water of the Woman to drink, and by his ſending his Diſciples into the City to buy Meat. But our Lord was more intent upon doing his Father's Work, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſatisfying his own hunger. Chriſt hungred more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Opportunity of doing good to the Souls of Men, than he did after Meat and Drink to ſatisfie his hunger. Lord! Let us thy Miniſters learn of thee to prefer the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Welfare of our People, before any temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="35">35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <hi>then</hi> cometh harveſt? Behold, I ſay unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harveſt. 36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that ſoweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoyce together. 37 And herein is that ſaying true, One ſoweth and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reapeth. 38 I ſent you to reap that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ye beſtowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entred into their labours.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having in the former Verſes given a moſt plain and evident Demonſtration of his fervent deſire to bring Souls home unto God, doth in theſe Verſes labor to ſtir up and kindle the like Affections in his Diſciples, and this he doth by three very effectual Arguments. The firſt Argument is drawn from the Ripeneſs of the People, and their Willingneſs to hear, and their Readineſs to be reaped and gathered by the Goſpel, (whereof there was a preſent inſtance in the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who were now coming forth in multitudes to Chriſt) which opportunity was therefore to be improved. <hi>Lift up your Eyes and look on the Fields, for they are white already for Harveſt. Learn hence,</hi> That as a People is ſometimes ripe for the Miniſtry of the Word, as Corn is ripe and ready for the Reapers Hand, ſo it is the Duty of the Miniſters of Chriſt, to lay hold upon ſuch Opportunities with as much deſire and delight as the Harveſt-Man, doth upon a reaping Seaſon. The ſecond Argument to ſtir up the Diſciples Diligence in preaching the Goſpel is drawn from the great Reward they ſhould receive for this their Work. <hi>He that reapeth receiveth Wages.</hi> The Harveſt Man's Wages is double to what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Labourers receive. The Miniſters of God ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good Wages at his Hand, how ill ſoever they are requited and rewarded by an unkind World. And as a farther Encouragement it follows, <hi>He that ſoweth and he that reapeth ſhall rejoice together;</hi> that is, the Prophets who took much pains in ſowing the Seed of the Goſpel and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and you my Apoſtles which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them and reap the Fruit of what they did ſow, ſhall have the ſame Reward in Glory and rejoyce together. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That not only the Succeſsful but the Faithful Labourer in God's Harveſt, ſhall be rewarded: not only thoſe which ſee the Fruit of their Miniſtry in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners, but ſuch as are faithful Seeds-Men. Though the Seed doth not come up till we are in our Graves, nay, though it rots under the Clods, and does not come up at all, yet ſhall the faithful Seeds-Man be rewarded according to his Labour, not according to his Succeſs. The third Argument to quicken the Diſciples Diligence is drawn from the Eaſineſs and Facility of that Labour which God required of them; <hi>Others have laboured, and you are entred into their Labours;</hi> that is, the Prophets and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt have prepared the Ground and ſown the Seed, and made ready a People for the Lord, and now you enter into their Labours, by forming and gathering them into a Goſpel-Church; yet this muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood abſolutely, but comparatively: Not as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets reaped nothing, converted none; but that their Fruit was ſmall in compariſon of the Succeſs which the Apoſtles found. Nor is it to be underſtood as if the Apoſtles took no pains at all, but that the Prophets grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pains rendred the Apoſtles Labours Succeſsful, who took leſs pains. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Wiſdom of God ſees it fit that all his Servants in the VVork of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry do not meet with the ſame Difficulties, nor enjoy the ſame Succeſs. Some are laborious Sowers, others are joyful Reapers; ſome labour all their Days with little viſible Succeſs, others bring in many to Chriſt, perhaps by a ſingle Sermon; ſome labour even with Wearineſs, and reap little, others enter into their Labours and reap much.</p>
               <p n="39">39 ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, for the ſaying of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which teſtified, He told me all that ever I did. 40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they beſought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 41 And many mo believed, becauſe of his own word: 42 And ſaid unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world.</p>
               <p>Here an Account is given of the Converſion of more of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> from the City <hi>Sychar.</hi> Some believed on him, upon the full Report which the VVoman had made, <hi>That he had told her all that ever ſhe did:</hi> But others were brought to believe by <hi>his own Word.</hi> Now from the VVomans being an Inſtrument to bring her Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Chriſt, by her own Experience of what ſhe had heard from him; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That very weak <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> when they employ themſelves for Chriſt, deſiring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol his Praiſe, and ſet forth his Glory, are ſometimes richly bleſſed with great Succeſs; <hi>Many of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans believed for the Saying of this poor Woman. Learn,</hi> 2. That when a Perſon can ſay but little of Chriſt, yet if it be ſpoken from Experience and ſenſible Feeling, it will be more Succeſsful and Perſuaſive, than much more that is ſpoken from Notional Knowledge. Such was this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Teſtimony concerning Chriſt; <hi>Come ſee a Man that told me all things that ever I did: Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> She ſpake what ſhe found, yea, what ſhe felt within her ſelf, and ſpeaking her own Experience, <hi>many believed on him for her Saying.</hi> But further, theſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed Chriſt to be a Prophet upon the Teſtimony of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But they believed him afterwards to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias or the Saviour of the World, upon the Credit and Authority of his own Word, <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>And many more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, becauſe of his own Word. Thence Learn,</hi> That although Inſtruments ſpeaking may be a means to draw Perſons to give ſome aſſent to Truth, yet it is Chriſt himſelf that muſt work a full Perſuaſion, and his own Word is the ſureſt Foundation for Faith to build and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb facs="tcp:46556:134"/> upon: <hi>Now we believe not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="43">43 ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee: 44 For Jeſus himſelf teſtified; that a prophet hath no honour in his own countrey. 45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having ſeen all the things that he did at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem at the feaſt: for they alſo went unto the feaſt.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having ſpent two days with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as an Introduction to the calling of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> he goes forward towards <hi>Galilee,</hi> the Place which he was pleaſed to make choice of, for the Exerciſe of the greateſt Part of his Miniſtry. Coming into <hi>Galilee</hi> he paſſeth by the City of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he had had his Education, knowing what little Reſpect he was like to find there: A Prophet ordinarily having little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in his own Country: Therefore ſhunning <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he goeth to <hi>Cana,</hi> where he had done his firſt Miracle. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That there is a real Tribute of Honour due unto every Prophet and Miniſter of God, which ought to be teſtified by Reverence to their Perſons, by a due Eſtimation of the Dignity of their Calling, by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Doctrine, and by an honourable Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. A Prophet ſhould have Honour; and Honour includes all theſe. 2. It is very uſual and ordinary for the Prophets of God to meet with leaſt Reſpect, where they are moſt known; their neareſt Neighbours, their neareſt Relations, their neareſt Acquaintance are oft-times fartheſt off from giving them that Honour that is due unto them. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3. That the true Prophets and Meſſengers of God ſhall be ſure to find ſome that will entertain their Perſons, and embrace their Miniſtry, though they be diſeſteemed and rejected by others. Tho' our Saviour had no Honour at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> yet he found Entertainment amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="46">46 So Jeſus came again into Cana of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain noble man, whoſe ſon was ſick at Capernaum. 47 When he heard that Jeſus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went unto him, and beſought him that he would come down and heal his ſon: for he was at the point of death. 48 Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 49 The noble man ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 50 Jeſus ſaith unto him, Go thy way; thy ſon liveth. And the man believed the word that Jeſus had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto him, and he went his way. 51 And as he was now going down, his ſervants met him, and told <hi>him,</hi> ſaying, Thy ſon liveth. 52 Then enquired he of them the hour, when he began to amend: and they ſaid unto him, Yeſterday at the ſeventh hour the fever left him. 53 So the father knew that <hi>it was</hi> at the ſame hour, in the which Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thy ſon liveth; and himſelf believed, and his whole houſe. 54 This <hi>is</hi> again the ſecond miracle <hi>that</hi> Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>
               <p>In this laſt Paragraph of the Chapter we find our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour performing a ſecond Miracle in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> curing a noble Man's Son that was ſick of a Fever: This noble Man apprehended Chriſt to be a Prophet, and believed that if he were bodily preſent with his Son he might poſſibly cure him; but he did not believe him to be the Meſſias, who was true God and every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Therefore to give him an infallible Proof that he was ſo, he tells him his Son was cured by the Word of his Mouth, even at that diſtance. By which Miracle he cured not only the Child of his Fever, but the Father of his Unbelief. From the whole we <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that here applies himſelf to Chriſt; <hi>A noble Man.</hi> We do not find Chriſt oft attended with Nobility. <hi>Have any of the Rulers believed on him?</hi> Yes; here is one? The Sovereign Grace of God is free, and he has his Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers among all Orders, Ranks and Degrees of Men. And tho' not many Noble are called, yet ſome are. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The Calamity which befel this noble Perſon; <hi>his Son was ſick,</hi> yea, dying. Earthly Greatneſs is no Defence againſt Afflictions; great Men are in Trouble as other Men; neither the Wealth and Riches of this noble Man, nor his Power and Authority, nor his Honour in his Country, nor his Favour with his Prince, could keep off God's Hand either from himſelf or from his Son: But the Father feels as much by Simpathy as the Child by Senſe. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. The Cauſe and ſpecial Occaſion which brought this noble Man to Chriſt: It was in general, an Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, in particular, the ſickneſs of his Child. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That great is the Fruit and Profit of Afflictions to the Children of Men. Many with this noble Man, never come to Chriſt till they be driven by the Croſs; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, God ſanctifies the Sickneſs and Death of near and dear Relations, (Children in ſpecial) to bring Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons nearer to himſelf. <hi>Note,</hi> 4. This noble Man was neither faithleſs nor faithful; had he been quite faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he had not taken ſuch Pains to come to Chriſt; had he been faithful, he had not limited the Son of God, by ſaying, <hi>Come down and heal my Son ere he die. Come down,</hi> as if Chriſt could not have cured him abſent; <hi>ere my Son die,</hi> as if the ſame Power required to heal him being ſick, could not raiſe him being dead. Lord, <hi>heal my Son,</hi> had been a proper Suit to him, who was the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician: But, <hi>Come down and heal him,</hi> was to teach Chriſt how to work. He who doth whatſoever he will, muſt do it how he will, and when he will. It is for us to crave and receive, not to preſcribe and appoint. <hi>Note,</hi> 5. The Meekneſs and great condeſcending Goodneſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; notwithſtanding the Infirmity of this poor Man, our Lord ſays, <hi>Go thy way, thy Son liveth.</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in the Creature is not the Motive that rules Chriſt. Should we meaſure our Hopes by our Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there were no Bleſſing to be hoped for; but if we meaſure them by Chriſt's Bounty and Compaſſion, there is no Bleſſing to be deſpaired of. <hi>Note,</hi> 6. How Chriſt not only anſwers the Deſires, but exceeds the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this diſtreſſed Perſon: His Requeſt was only, <hi>Come and heal my Son.</hi> Chriſt's Anſwer was, <hi>Go thy way, thy Son liveth.</hi> Our heavenly Father, when he doth not give us what we ask, gives us better than we asked. We ask what we think beſt, but God gives what he knows beſt. Chriſt here gave a greater Demonſtration of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency than was craved. <hi>Note, Laſtly,</hi> With one Word doth Chriſt heal two Patients; the Son of his Fever, the Father of his Unbelief. It was a low degree of Faith that brought the Father to Chriſt; it was an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that ſent him back to his Son; but higheſt of all, when finding his Son healed, he himſelf believed and his whole Houſe. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That a weak Faith may be true, but a true Faith is always growing and increaſing; <hi>It is like the Path of the Juſt, that ſhineth more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the perfect Day.</hi>

               <p>AFter this there was a feaſt of the Jews, and Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem. 2 Now there is at Jeruſalem by the ſheep-<hi>market</hi> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, having five porches. 3 In theſe lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, waiting for the the moving of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 4 For an angel went down at a certain ſeaſon into the pool, and troubled the water: whoſoever then firſt after the troubling of the
<pb facs="tcp:46556:134"/> water ſtepped in, was made whole of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſeaſe he had.</p>
               <p>This Chapter begins with a Deſcription of the famous Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> whoſe Waters were Medicinal to cure the firſt comer thereinto, whatſoever Diſeaſe he had. Some think this was effected in a natural way, and that the Entrails of the ſacrificed Beaſts being waſted in this Pool, an healing Vertue was communicated for curing the Palſie and ſuch cold Diſeaſes: As Perſons that have lame and withered Hands are at this day, directed to put them into the Belly of a Beaſt newly opened. But others look upon the healing Vertue of this Pool to be ſupernatural and miraculous, becauſe it cured all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, how old, great and deſperate ſoever, and this in a moment, or very quickly; and but one at a time; and that one, the firſt that ſtepp'd in only, after an Angel had deſcended and troubled the Waters: All which ſhew that the healing Vertue came not from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Waters, but that it was a ſupernatural Work. Some think that the Miracle of this Pool was granted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> partly to ſtrengthen them in the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and to confirm them in their religious Courſe of Sacrificing, againſt the Scoffs of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were now their Lords; ſuch a Vertue being given to that Water wherein their Sacrifices were wont to be waſhed. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That means of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how improbable and unlikely ſoever, muſt not be deſpiſed, but awfully admired, and thankfully uſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the way and manner of their working be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or comprehended by us.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 6 When Jeſus ſaw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <hi>in that caſe,</hi> he ſaith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 7 The impotent man anſwered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another ſteppeth down before me. 8 Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy bed, and walk. 9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the ſame day was the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. 10 ¶ The Jews therefore ſaid unto him that was cured, It is the ſabbath-day; it is not lawful for thee to carry <hi>thy</hi> bed. 11 He anſwered them, He that made me whole, the ſame ſaid unto me, Take up thy bed and walk. 12 Then asked they him, What man is that which ſaid unto thee, Take up thy bed and walk? 13 And he that was healed, wiſt not who it was: for Jeſus had conveyed himſelf away, a multitude being in <hi>that</hi> place.</p>
               <p>It was very commendable that the rich Men did not engroſs this Pool, and the Benefit of it to themſelves, but ſuffered poor People to come to it. In this College of Cripples a poor Man that had been lame thirty eight Years was found, who wanting Strength to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wanting Money to hire others, and others wanting Mercy to help him; Chriſt takes pity on him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not go to Health, Health is graciouſly brought to him, and that by the Hand of the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That not only are Mens Bodies ſubject to innumerable Infirmities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, but it pleaſes God for wiſe Ends to continue ſome of his Servants labouring under bodily Weakneſs for many Years together, yea, even all the days of their Life. Here is a poor Man for eight and thirty Years together under the Diſcipline of God's Rod by bodily Weakneſs. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That it is the Duty of the Afflicted to wait upon God in a diligent uſe of all Means which God has appointed for their Help and Healing: As to truſt to Means, is to neglect God; ſo to neglect the Means, is to tempt God. This poor Man, no doubt, had made uſe of the Means before, yet waits at the Pool now. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. Tho' Chriſt well knew the Caſe of this afflicted Perſon, and wanted no Information, yet he asks him, If he were willing to be made whole? to make him ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Miſery, to quicken his Deſires after healing, and to raiſe his Expectations of Help from him. Tho' Chriſt knows our Wants, yet he takes no notice of them, till we make them known to him by Prayer. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The time when Chriſt wrought this Miracle of healing upon the impotent Man; it was on <hi>the Sabbath-day;</hi> and as an Evidence of the certainty of the Cure, Chriſt bids him <hi>take up his Bed and walk.</hi> Our Saviour's Miracles were real and beneficial, they were obvious to Senſe, and would bear the Examination of all Perſons. The Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> boaſt of, will not bear the Examination of our Senſes: Their great Miracle, Tranſubſtantiation, is ſo far from being obvious to Senſe, that it contradicts the Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind, and is the greateſt Affront to humane Nature that ever the World was acquainted with. And our Saviour's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this and many other Miracles, on the Sabbath-day was for the Teſtification of the Miracles to all Perſons that would take notice of them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 5. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly the <hi>Jews</hi> tax the Cripple that was healed with the breach of the Sabbath, for taking up his Bed and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sabbath-day; whereas the Law only forbad carrying Burthens on the Sabbath-day for Profit, in a way of Trade: But this Man's carrying his Bed, was a Teſtimony of God's Goodneſs and Mercy towards him, and of his Gratitude and Thankfulneſs towards God. Hypocritical and ſuperſtitious Perſons oft-times pretend much Zeal for obſerving the Letter of the Law, little reſpecting the Moral Senſe and Signification of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our Saviour had a mind to let the <hi>Jews</hi> know that he was Lord of the Sabbath, that he had a Power over it, and could diſpenſe with it as he thought good. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Laſtly,</hi> The great Modeſty and Humility of our bleſſed Saviour, how hateful all Oſtentation and Vain-glory was unto him; for having wrought this famous Miracle before the People at a Publick Time, the Feaſt of the Paſſover, to ſhun all Applauſe from the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he conveys himſelf privately away from them: <hi>Jeſus conveyed himſelf away, a multitude being in that place.</hi> Our Saviour's Buſineſs was to do much Good, and make but little Noiſe: He ſought not his own Glory.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Afterward Jeſus findeth him in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are our Saviour's ſeaſonable Advice and Counſel to the poor impotent Cripple, whom he had miraculouſly reſtored to Health and Soundneſs. <hi>Where, Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Perſon admoniſhing; <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he that had been his Phyſician before, is his Monitor and Teacher now: <hi>Behold, thou art whole; ſin no more.</hi> Oh, how much is it the Duty, but how ſeldom the Practice of thoſe whom God makes Inſtruments for recovering bodily Health, to put their Patients in mind of their Obligations to Thankfulneſs and new Obedience? Thus did our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our here. The Recovered Mans Phyſician gave him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, his Healer became his Monitor. <hi>Sin no more. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Perſon admoniſhed, the recovered Cripple: <hi>Thou art made whole.</hi> But, what was he? Not a Diſciple, not a Believer: <hi>For he that was healed, wiſt not who Jeſus was,</hi> v. 13. he knew not Chriſt, therefore believed not on him, and yet was healed by him. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That there are many outward Mercies and common Bleſſings which Chriſt beſtows upon thoſe that have no ſpiritual Knowledge of him, or ſaving Acquaintance with him. <hi>The Man that was healed, wiſt not who he was that had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Place where Chriſt meets this his recovered Patient; not at the Tavern, but in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, returning Thanks to God for his recovered Health. When God ſends forth his Word and healeth us, it is our Duty to make our firſt Viſit to God's Houſe, and to pay our Vows in the great Congregation, and found forth the Praiſes of our great and gracious Deliverer. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Circumſtance of Time when Chriſt found him in the Temple, ſoon after his recovery. <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Jeſus findeth him in the Temple.</hi> We muſt not be cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and importunate to receive Mercies, and dumb and tongue-tied in returning Thanks; but make haſte,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:135"/> and not delay the time to pay our Acknowledgments to him that healeth us. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 5. The Admonition it ſelf; <hi>Behold, thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> where our Saviour admoniſhes him of the greatneſs of the Mercy; <hi>Behold, thou art made whole;</hi> and ſubjoyns a cautionary Direction, <hi>Sin no more.</hi> Where it is neceſſarily implyed, that ſin is always the deſerving, and oft times the procuring Cauſe of a Perſon's Afflictions and Calamities; and that the beſt and ſureſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Return of Judgments and Calamities to a Perſon, is for a Perſon to return no more to ſin; <hi>Sin no more leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> where it is farther impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Almighty God has ſorer Plagues and ſeverer Judgments in ſtore for thoſe Sinners who go on obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in a Courſe of Sin and Rebellion againſt God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ſignal Rebukes of his avenging Anger. From the whole Note, That when the Lord doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly heal a Perſon or a People, it is a Mercy to be much obſerved and thankfully acknowledged.</p>
               <p n="15">15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jeſus which had made him whole. 16 And therefore did the Jews perſecute Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he had done theſe things on the ſabbath day.</p>
               <p>After the Man underſtood who his Healer and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor was, he went and told the Jewiſh Magiſtrates, it was Chriſt that had healed him. This he did, not with any evil Deſign no doubt, to inform againſt him and ſtir up the Jews to perſecute him, but deſirous to publiſh what Chriſt had done to his Honour, and to direct others to make uſe of him. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is the Duty of all thoſe that have experienced the Power and Pity of Chriſt themſelves to proclaim and publiſh it to others, to the intent that all that need him may experience Help and Healing from him. This ſeems to be the poor Man's Deſign: But behold the Blindneſs, Obſtinacy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Jews, who perſecuted Chriſt and ſought to kill him for doing good, and healing a Cripple that had been thirty eight Years ſo: <hi>Therefore did the Jews perſecute Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay him.</hi> Yet obſerve, the Cloak and Pretence they have for their malicious Perſecution of our Saviour, namely, the ſuppoſed Violation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day; <hi>They ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he had done theſe things on the Sabbath-day. Learn hence,</hi> That great Cruelty againſt Chriſt and his Members, has always been and ſtill is, masked and diſguiſed with a fair Pretence of Zeal for God and his Commands. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> mortally hated our Saviour, therefore, to cover their Malice, they traduce him as a Prophaner of the Sabbath, and ſeek to take away his Life.</p>
               <p n="17">17 ¶ But Jeſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
               <p>From this Verſe to the End of the Chapter, we have our Saviour's Apology, for his working the foregoing Cure on the impotent Man on the Sabbath-Day. And the chief Argument he inſiſts upon, is drawn from his Unity and Equality in Nature and Operation with his Father; <hi>As the Father worketh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo I work.</hi> Here he ſpeaks of himſelf not as a Servant, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Father's Hand, but as a Fellow-Worker with the Father, both in the Works of Creation and in the Works of Providence and Preſervation alſo. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That although Almighty God has long ſince ceaſed from the Works of Creation, yet not from the Work of Preſervation. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto;</hi> not by creating new Kinds of Creatures, but by upholding and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what he has already created. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That Chriſt the Son of God, is joyned with and undivided from the Father in Working. As the Father created all things by him (not as a Man and as an Inſtrument in the Father's Hand, for then he was not ſuch) but as his Fellow-Worker, being equal in Nature and Power, with the Father; in like manner as the Father preſerveth, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, governeth and upholdeth all things, ſo doth Chriſt; the Father's Actions and his, being the ſame. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 Therefore the Jews ſought the more to kill him, becauſe he not only had broken the ſabbath, but ſaid alſo that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God. 19 Then anſwered Jeſus, and ſaid unto them, Verily verily I ſay unto you, The Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do: for what things ſoever he doeth, theſe alſo doeth the Son likewiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> inſtead of being ſatisfied, were the more enraged, not only becauſe he had violated the Sabbath, (as they pretended) by healing the Cripple on the Sabbath-Day, but becauſe Chriſt had aſſerted, that God was his Father in a peculiar manner, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal with God. Our Saviour therefore goes on to aſſert his Equality and Conjunction with the Father in his Operations and Workings, which doth at once ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify his Work on the Sabbath-day, and prove him to be truly and really God. Now our holy Lord to prove himſelf equal with God the Father, produces firſt many Arguments to <hi>v.</hi> 31. and then alledges the Teſtimony of many Witneſſes, to the end of the Chapter. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's firſt Argument to prove himſelf equal with the Father in Eſſence and Nature is this, That the Father and he are equal in Operation, in Will and Conſent for Working; that the Son doth all that the Father doth, and the Father doth nothing without the Son, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>The Son can do nothing of himſelf;</hi> that is, as Man, as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias; and as Mediator, he could do nothing of himſelf. His perfect Obedience to, and Complyance with, the Will of his Father that ſent him, would not ſuffer him to do any thing without him: But as God, he could do all things of himſelf. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proof that the Father and Son are one in Nature, Eſſence and Being, in that they are inſeparable and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Operation and Working; <hi>What things ſoever the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe; and the Son doth nothing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Father and Son being equal in Operation and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are equal in Nature and Being; and conſequently both eſſentially truly and really God. Therefore the Arians of old, and the Socinians at this Day are wide, when they produce this Text, <hi>The Son can do nothing of himſelf,</hi> to prove that Chriſt is not equal with God the Father. They forget or neglect to diſtinguiſh betwixt his Divine Nature, which could do all things, and his Mediatorial Office, which could not do, but what the Father that ſent him, had appointed him to do.</p>
               <p n="20">20 For the Father loveth the Son, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him all things that himſelf doeth: and he will ſhew him greater works then theſe, that ye may marvel.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument which our Saviour produces to prove his Unity in Nature and Equality in Operation with the Father, is drawn from that ſpecial Love which the Father beareth to the Son, which inclines him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate all things to him by a Divine and Ineffable Communication. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That God the Father loveth Jeſus Chriſt his Son. with an Eſſential, Natural and Neceſſary Love, as being the Subſtantial Image of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Splendor and Brightneſs of his Glory. <hi>The Father loveth the Son;</hi> that is, with an Eſſential, Eternal and Ineffable Love. 2. That the Father's Love to Chriſt was Communicative; the Father communicated his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Nature, his Wiſdom and Power for Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Son: <hi>The Father ſheweth the Son all things that himſelf doth,</hi> namely, by a Divine, Inconceivable and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Communication.</p>
               <p n="21">21 For as the Father raiſeth up the dead and quickneth <hi>them:</hi> even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</p>
               <p>A third Argument proving Chriſt to be God, and equal with the Father, is here produced, namely, his raiſing of the dead: He is jointly with the Father in that Work,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:135"/> and equal with him: <hi>As the Father quickneth whom he pleaſe, ſo doth the Son quicken whom he will;</hi> that is, not as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Inſtrument, but as a principal Agent, by the ſame Authority, and with the like abſolute Freedom of Will which the Father uſes, being a Sovereign and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being as the Father is; <hi>As the Father raiſeth the dead and quickneth them, ſo the Son quickneth whom he will. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That quickning and raiſing of the dead is an Act of Omnipotency and proper to God only; <hi>The Father raiſeth the dead and quickneth them.</hi> 2. That Chriſt's Power to raiſe the dead as well as his Father, is a Proof of his Equality with his Father, and an Evidence of his being truly and really God; <hi>the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 23 That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him.</p>
               <p>A fourth Inſtance of Chriſt's God-head, and proof of his Equality with the Father, is, That it is his Work to judge the World; <hi>The Father,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>judges no Man;</hi> that is, no Man without me, but all Men by me, to this intent, <hi>That all Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> that is, honour him with the ſame Faith, Love, Fear, Worſhip that is due and payable to God the Father. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That Chriſt as God hath the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power of Life and Death, of Abſolution and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which he executes in Conjunction with his Father. 2. That Chriſt having this Power of judging the World, with the Father, doth ſhew that the ſame Glory is due to him, which is due unto the Father. <hi>All Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> 3. That ſuch as pretend to honour Chriſt, but deny him to be God, equal with the Father, They withdraw the higheſt Honour from him; and ſuch as withdraw Honour from the Son, deny it to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who will not be honoured but in and through ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of the Son. This Text ſpeaks dread and terror to the Socinians, who pretend to Honour Chriſt, but not with the ſame Honour with which they pretend to honour the Father: in God's Account they honour him not at all; <hi>For he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 Verily verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation; but is paſſed from death unto life. 25 Verily verily I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear ſhall live. 26 For as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath life in himſelf; ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf; 27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</p>
               <p>Here we have a fifth Evidence of Chriſt's God-head and Equality with the Father, namely, that he is the Author of Spiritual and Eternal Life, to all that believe on him. He that was a Fountain of Life equal with the Father, and communicated to him from the Father, is God: But Chriſt hath this, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>For as the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo he has given to the Son to have Life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Again, he that hath Authority to execute Judgment upon Angels and Men, is God; but Chriſt hath ſuch Authority, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>He hath given him Authority to execute Judgment.</hi> Farther, he that with his Voice quickneth and maketh alive them that hear it, is God, but Chriſt doth this, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>The dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God and live.</hi> The <hi>Dead,</hi> that is, 1. The Spiritually dead; ſuch as are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins: Theſe hearing the Voice of Chriſt in the Miniſtry of the Word, ſhall live, a Life of Grace on Earth, and a Life of Glory in Heaven. 2. Such as are Corporeally dead alſo; theſe are likewiſe quickned and raiſed by Chriſt as God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That God the Father hath communicated to Chriſt his Son, a Power to quicken and enliven ſuch as are Spiritually and Corporally dead. 2. That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's communicating this Power to the Son argues no Inequality nor Inferiority in the Son, but he hath the ſame Life infinitely, independently and equally with the Father, <hi>as the Father hath it, ſo hath the Son;</hi> the Father hath it in himſelf, and ſo hath the Son alſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son as well as the Father, is eſſentially and truly God.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, 29 And ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of damnation.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour finding the Jews amazed and aſtoniſhed at his declaring his Sovereign and Supreme Authority and Power to quicken and raiſe whom he pleaſed from the dead, doth in theſe Verſes aſſure them, that there ſhould be a general Reſurrection and an univerſal Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both of the Righteous and the Wicked; and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments in another Life, according to Men's Actions here in this Life. <hi>All that are in</hi> the <hi>Graves ſhall hear my Voice, and ſhall come forth. Here obſerve,</hi> 1. The Certainty and Univerſality of the Reſurrection of the dead declared; <hi>The Hour is coming in which all that are in the Graves ſhall come forth. Obſ.</hi> 2. The powerful and efficacious Means by which this great and ſudden Change ſhall be effected and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the Morning of the Reſurrection; namely, the omnipotent Voice or Chriſt; <hi>All that are in the Graves ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi> 3. Here are the different ends of the Reſurrection declared according to the Difference of Perſons which ſhall then be raiſed, Good and Bad; <hi>Thoſe that have done good, to the Reſurrection of Life, and thoſe that have done evil to the Reſurrection of Damnation. Learn,</hi> 1. That there ſhall certainly be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body. 2. That all in the Graves ſhall be raiſed, though not all alike; the Wicked ſhall be raiſed by the Power of Chriſt, as their Judge; the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be raiſed, by Virtue of their Union with Chriſt, as their Head. 3. According as Men live in this World and go out of it, ſo will they be found at the Reſurrection, without any Change of their State; there will then be only two ſorts of Perſons, Good and Bad. All that have done Good, how ſmall ſoever the Degree of their Goodneſs hath been, ſhall be rewarded: And all that have done Evil, ſhall be everlaſtingly puniſhed; For all Perſons ſhall be eternally Happy or intollerably Miſerable in the other World, accordingly as they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Deportment and Behaviour in this Life; <hi>They that have done Good ſhall go,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="30">30 I can of mine own ſelf do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is juſt; becauſe I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which hath ſent me.</p>
               <p>Here Chriſt declares to the Jews, and in them to all Mankind, that they might aſſure themſelves his Judgment would be exactly Righteous; becauſe he had no private Will or Power of his own, contrary to, or different from his Father. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt being the ſame in Eſſence and Nature, in Power and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration with the Father, had no private Will or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his own, but acted all things as God, in Co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the Father; and as Man in Subordination to him; <hi>I can of my own ſelf do nothing;</hi> that is, neither as God, nor as Mediator; not as God, for God the Father and Chriſt being one, equal in Power, what one Perſon did the other doth; not as Mediator, for ſo Chriſt fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Work which his Father gave him to do; the Will of the Father and the Will of Chriſt being both one.</p>

               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having produced theſe five fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Arguments to prove his Unity in Eſſence, and his Equality in Power with the Father, comes now to the end of the Chapter, to produce ſeveral Teſtimonies for the Proof of it; and the firſt of them is the Teſtimony of God his Father; <hi>There is another that beareth witneſs of me, whoſe witneſs is True.</hi> Now the Father had lately at Chriſt's Baptiſm by a Voice from Heaven declared him to be his beloved Son, in whom he was well-pleaſed: which illuſtrious Teſtimony given to Chriſt, they had not regarded. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That as Chriſt came into the World in Obedience to his Father, and to bear witneſs to him; ſo did the Father honour him and bear witneſs of him; and his Teſtimony concerning his Son is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly True, and to be depended and reſted upon; for we make the Father a Lyar, if we do not depend upon the Record which he has given of his Son.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Ye ſent unto John, and he bare witneſs unto the truth. 34 But I receive not teſtimony from man: but theſe things I ſay, that ye might be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Teſtimony to prove Chriſt to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias was that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. We read, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. how the <hi>Jews</hi> ſent to inquire of him, whether he were the Chriſt or not; and he denied it, and pointed at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God;</hi> yet would not the <hi>Jews</hi> abide by this Teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> concerning the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. Nevertheleſs, ſays Chriſt, <hi>I receive not teſtimony from John;</hi> that is, <hi>John</hi> by his Teſtimony addeth nothing to me; I was what I was, and I am what I am, before <hi>John</hi> teſtified of me, and ſince. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt's Perſon, and the Verity of his Doctrine, needs no Man's Teſtimony for the Confirmation of it, being ſufficiently confirmed by Chriſt's own Authority, and his Father's Teſtimony: <hi>I receive not Teſtimony from Man;</hi> that is, I need it not, I deſire it not upon my own Account, but upon yours only, that upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of <hi>John</hi>'s Teſtimony ye might believe on me, and be ſaved by me: <hi>Theſe things I ſay, that ye might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerve here, John</hi>'s Character and the Peoples Carriage. 1. <hi>John</hi>'s Character; he was a <hi>Light, a burning and a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Light:</hi> He had in him a Light of Knowledge, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, direct, and comfort others; and this his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was accompanied with Zeal, he was a <hi>burning Light</hi> in his Doctrine, and a <hi>ſhining</hi> Lamp in his Converſation: He had the Light of Knowledge in his Head, the Warmth of Zeal in his Heart, and the Influence of both in his Life. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That thoſe whom God calls to the Office and Work of the Miniſtry, he furniſhes with Abilities and Endowments ſuitable to their great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, he endues them with a Light of Knowledge, which is animated with the Heat and Warmth of Zeal. 2. That Miniſterial Gifts and Abilities are not beſtowed alike upon all, but diſperſed variouſly. All are Lights, according to their Meaſure, but all are not equally burning and ſhining Lights for Proportion and Degree. 3. That the brighteſt, burning and cleareſt ſhining Lights in the Church of Chriſt, have but their time in this World, they are ſubject as well as other Men to the common Condition of Mortality, and the Lamp of their Lives burns out the faſter by lighting others to Heaven. <hi>John</hi> was a burning and a ſhining Light, but now is put out and gone. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. As <hi>John</hi>'s Character, ſo the Peoples Carriage; <hi>ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his Light.</hi> Here is a threefold Gradation; they <hi>rejoyced:</hi> They <hi>rejoyced in his Light,</hi> and they <hi>rejoyced for a ſeaſon.</hi> 1. They <hi>rejoyced.</hi> The word ſignifies, they leaped for Joy, and danced about him as Children do about a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, when he firſt began his Miniſtry amongſt them. Oh, how warm are the Affections of a People, when a pious and zealous Miniſter comes firſt among them! 2. They <hi>rejoyced in his Light,</hi> not in his Heat: Or, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in <hi>John</hi>'s Light, not in Chriſt's: For when they found that <hi>John</hi> bare Record to Chriſt, they ſoon grew cold in their Affections towards <hi>John.</hi> 3. They <hi>rejoyced</hi> only <hi>for a ſeaſon;</hi> for an hour, as the word ſignifies. For a ſhort time <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry was acceptable. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That it has been an old Practice amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, not to like their Paſtors long, though they have been never ſuch burning and ſhining Lights. <hi>John</hi> was not changed, but his Hearers were changed; he did burn and ſhine in the Candleſtick of the Church with equal Zeal and Luſtre to the laſt, but they had changed their Thoughts of him, and loſt their Eſteem for him. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That as nothing in general is ſo mutable as the Mind of Man, ſo nothing in particular is ſo variable as the Affections and Opinions of People towards their Miniſters. The Lamp of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry was always alike, burning and ſhining, his Oil did not waſte; but his Hearers Zeal waſted, and their Affections cooled: Thoſe whoſe Gifts are not at all abated, may yet find a great abatement in the acceptation of their Gifts: Therefore let no Men live upon the Breath of Men, leaſt of all let Miniſters live upon the popular Air, or the Speech of People. Oh, let us live upon the Credit which we have with God, and rejoyce chiefly in his Eſteem. If our Performances find acceptance with God, we are ſafe and happy, tho' they fall under Contempt with Men.</p>
               <p n="36">36 ¶ But I have greater witneſs then <hi>that</hi> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do, bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</p>
               <p>The third Teſtimony produced by Chriſt, to evidence and prove himſelf to be the promiſed Meſſias and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, is that of his Miracles; which, by an Omnipotent Power, as God, he was enabled to work. Chriſt's Miracles were ſpeaking Teſtimonies of his Unity with the Father, and of the Divinity of his Perſon. Not ſo the Miracles of his Apoſtles; for he wrought his Miracles in his own Name, and by his own Power and Authority; but the Apoſtles expreſly declared the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.12, 16. <hi>Why look ye ſo ſtedfaſtly on us, as if we by our own power had made this Man whole? His name, through faith in his name, hath made this Man ſtrong. Learn hence,</hi> That the Teſtimony of Chriſt's own Works, his Miracles wrought in his own Name, and by his own Authority and Power, is a clearer Confirmation of his Godhead, Office and Doctrine, than the beſt of Mens Teſtimonies; yea, than <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's own Teſtimony, <hi>That he ſaw the Spirit deſcending on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37 And the Father himſelf which hath ſent me, hath born witneſs of me. Ye have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard his voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape. 38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath ſent, him ye believe not.</p>
               <p>Here our bleſſed Saviour produces again the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Father, that he was the true and promiſed Meſſias: This was given him both at his Baptiſm and his Transfiguration; when God the Father owned Chriſt to be his Son, by an audible Voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Which Teſtimony the <hi>Jews</hi> now ought the more to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, becauſe tho' their Fore-fathers had heard the Voice of God at certain times, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. yet they in their times had never heard his Voice. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Fathers immediate Teſtimony of Chriſt from Heaven, is greater than all Teſtimonies given to him here on Earth; greater than <hi>John</hi>'s, greater than his Miracles. The preſence of the glorious Trinity, when that Teſtimony was given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt,</hi> made that Witneſs moſt awful and ſolemn.</p>
               <p n="39">39 ¶ Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:136"/>
               <p>The next Teſtimony which Chriſt appeals to, is the Teſtimony of the Scriptures: That is, the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets, which Chriſt bids the <hi>Jews</hi> diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearch, and they ſhall find that they abundantly teſtified of him, and that all the Prophecies and Types were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him. The word <hi>(ſearch)</hi> ſignifying to ſearch as Men do for a golden Mine in the Bowels of the Earth; which they muſt dig deep for, before they can come at. It intimates 1. That there is an ineſtimable Treaſure lying hid in the holy Scriptures, which we ſhall never fathom by a ſlight ſuperficial ſearch. 2. That this ineſtimable Treaſure may be found out by the painful Searcher, and it is the Duty of all the Members of the viſible Church to read and ſearch the Scriptures, which point out the way to eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="40">40 And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour upbraids the <hi>Jews</hi> for their obſtinate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; that notwithſtanding God the Father by a Voice from Heaven, &amp; <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt by his Teſtimony on Earth; notwithſtanding all the Miracles which they had ſeen wrought by Chriſt himſelf, and notwithſtanding the Scriptures, which they pretended ſo highly to eſteem of, did prove him to be the Meſſias, and the Author of eternal Life, which they profeſt to ſeek; yet ſuch was their Obſtinacy, that they would not come unto him, nor believe in him. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life. Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. A choice and invaluable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which Chriſt ſtands ready to beſtow upon poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that is Life, both Spiritual and Eternal. A Life of Grace, in order to a Life of Glory. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The gracious Condition upon which this invaluable Bleſſing may be had, and that is upon coming to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, and receiving of him. 3. Here is the true Reaſon declared why Sinners do miſs of Life and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, when he has ſo dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it for them, and does ſo freely tender it unto them, and that lies in their own Wilfulneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy: <hi>Ye will not come unto me. Learn hence,</hi> That the true Reaſon why ſo many Sinners miſs of Salvation and eternal Life, after all that Chriſt has done and ſuffered for them, is their own obſtinacy and unwillingneſs to come to him that they may have Life. Man by Nature has not only an Inability, but a fixed Enmity in his Will againſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="41">41 I receive not honour from men. 42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 43 I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if another ſhall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1. How little our Saviour ſought the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and vain-glorious Eſtimation of Men. <hi>I receive not honour from Men.</hi> The ſame ſhould all his Diſciples and Followers do; reſt ſatisfied in the ſecret Teſtimony and ſilent Applauſe of their own Conſciences, without pumping for popular Applauſe. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin which Chriſt charged upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the cauſe why they rejected him. <hi>I know, that you have not the love of God in you.</hi> Oh deplorable State and Caſe, to be void of all true Love to God! Love being the Spring of all Action, and the Root of all true Obedience; he that loves God, will not only ſweat at his Work, but bleed at his Work too, if his Work cannot be carried on without bleeding: But where Love to God is wanting, and no Care to pleaſe God is found, his Authority is deſpiſed, his Son rejected: As the <hi>Jews</hi> here would not come to Chriſt that they might have Life, becauſe they had not the Love of God in them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The high Affront which the <hi>Jews</hi> offered to the Son of God in preferring any Seducers and Impoſtors before him, who came in their own Names; whilſt he was rejected, who came in the Name of his Father. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That altho' Chriſt was the great Ambaſſador of his Father, not a Servant, but a Son, and had his Miſſion, his Approbation, and his Teſtimony from Heaven, yet ſo far did the Perverſeneſs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the <hi>Jews</hi> prevail, that he was rejected, whilſt Impoſtors and Deceivers, falſe Chriſts, and Anti-Chriſts, without any Evidence and Authority from God, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe promiſing them a temporal Kingdom) were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and entertained. <hi>I come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: But if another, a Seducer ſhall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="44">44 How can ye believe, which receive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that <hi>cometh</hi> from God only?</p>
               <p>Here Chriſt tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it is impoſſible they ſhould believe aright in him, becauſe they were ſo in love with the Praiſe of Men, that they would own him for the Meſſias who would promiſe them a temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in the mean time reject himſelf who came authorized with the Teſtimony and Approbation of God. You will receive Honour one of another, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Honour that cometh from God only. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch as ambitiouſly hunt after Vain-glory and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from Men, do evidence themſelves to be regardleſs of God's Approbation and Acceptation.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father: there is <hi>one</hi> that accuſeth you, <hi>even</hi> Moſes, in whom ye truſt. 46 For had ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Moſes, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how ſhall ye believe my words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Think not that I will accuſe you;</hi> that is, that <hi>I only</hi> will accuſe you <hi>to the Father; there is one that accuſeth you, even</hi> Moſes; that is, the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to depend upon and to truſt to: <hi>For, had you believed his Writings,</hi> that is, the Propheſies and Types contained in his Writings, <hi>you would have</hi> been led by them to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on me;</hi> for they all pointed at me, and received their Accompliſhment in me: But, if <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot be heard by you, I muſt expect no Authority with you. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the whole Scope of <hi>Moſes</hi> Ceremonial Law was to point out and prefigure Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt was the Sum of the Law, as well as the Subſtance of the Goſpel; he was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s promiſed Seed, <hi>Moſes</hi> his great Prophet, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Shiloh, Eſay</hi>'s <hi>Emanuel, Daniel</hi>'s Holy One, <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Branch, and <hi>Malachi</hi>'s Angel. 2.

               <p>AFter theſe things Jeſus went over the ſea of Galilee, which is <hi>the ſea</hi> of Tiberias.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How buſie and induſtrious our holy Lord was about his Father's Work, both on the Sea and on the Land, both by Night and by Day; <hi>His Meat was to do the Will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his Work.</hi> Some have inquired into the Reaſons why Chriſt travelled by Sea, as well as by Land; and they ſeem to be theſe. 1. To ſhew what his intent was in making the Sea, namely, to be ſailed upon, as the Land was made to be walked upon. 2. That Chriſt might take occaſion to manifeſt his Deity in working Miracles upon the Sea, as well as upon the Land. 3. Might it not be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and encourage ſea-faring Men that dwell much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Waters, in the midſt of their Diſtreſſes, to truſt in and pray unto ſuch a Saviour as had himſelf an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Knowledge of the dangers of the Seas? Some have farther obſerved, That after our Saviour's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we never find him ſailing upon the Seas more; for ſuch a turbulent Condition which neceſſarily attends Sea Voyages, was utterly inconſiſtent with the ſtability and perpetuity of Chriſt's State, when he was riſen from the dead; the firm Land better agreeing with his fix'd Eſtate than the fluctuating Water.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And a great multitude followed him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw his miracles which he did on them that were diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> What an exact Knowledge Chriſt had, not only of all his Followers, but of the Motives and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb facs="tcp:46556:137"/> which did induce them to follow him; it was not the Excellency of his Perſon, nor the heavenlineſs of his Doctrine, that drew the multitude at this time after him, but the Novelty of his Miracles; <hi>They ſaw the Miracles which he did:</hi> It is better to feel one Miracle wrought upon the Heart, in changing and renewing That, than to ſee a thouſand outward Miracles wrought before our Eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſat with his diſciples. 4 And the Paſſover, a feaſt of the Jews, was nigh. 5 ¶ When Jeſus then lift up <hi>his</hi> eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto Philip, Whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat? 6 (And this he ſaid to prove him: for he himſelf knew what he would do) 7 Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip anſwered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not ſufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 8 One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him, 9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley-loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes, but what are they among ſo many? 10 And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſs in the place. So the men ſat down, in number about five thouſand. 11 And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he diſtributed to the diſciples, and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to them that were ſet down; and likewiſe of the fiſhes, as much as they would. 12 When they were filled, he ſaid unto his diſciples, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the fragments that remain, that nothing be loſt. 13 Therefore they gathered <hi>them</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and filled twelve baskets with the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. 14 Then thoſe men, when they had ſeen the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth that prophet that ſhould come into the world.</p>
               <p>This Miracle of our Saviour's feeding five thouſand Perſons with five Barly Loaves and two ſmall Fiſhes is, recorded by all the four Evangeliſts; and ſeveral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars therein are very remarkable. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. What a poor and ſlender Proviſion the Lord of the whole Earth has for his Family, for himſelf, for his Diſciples and the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; nothing more than five Barley Loaves and two Fiſhes: Teaching us that theſe Bodies of ours muſt be fed, not pampered. Our Belly muſt not be our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, much leſs our God; and as the Quality of the Victuals was plain, ſo was the Quantity ſmall; only five Loaves and two Fiſhes. Well might the Diſciples ſay <hi>What are they among ſo many?</hi> The Eye of Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſees an utter Impoſſibility of thoſe Effects which Faith can eaſily apprehend and a Divine Power more eaſily produce. When Men judge by Senſe and Reaſon, and do not look to Chriſt's Power, if Extremities come, they are ſoon at their wits end, and know not what to do. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How the great Maſter of this miraculous Feaſt doth marſhal his Gueſts; he commands them to ſit down. None of the People reply, Sit down? But to what? Here's the Mouths, but where's the Meat? we may ſoon be ſet, but when ſhall we be ſerved? not a word like this; but they obey and expect. Lord! how eaſie is it to truſt thy Providence and rely upon thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when there is Corn in the Barn, Bread in the Cupboard, Money in the Purſe; but when our Stores are empty, when our Stock runs low, when we have nothing in Hand, then to depend upon an inviſible Bounty is a noble Act of Faith indeed. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Actions perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by our Bleſſed Saviour, 1. He <hi>bleſt</hi> the Loaves: Teaching us, by his Example never to uſe or receive the good Creatures of God without Prayer and Praiſe; not to ſit down to our Food as a Beaſt to his Fodder. 2. Chriſt <hi>broke</hi> the Loaves; he could have multiplied them whole, why then doth he rather chooſe to do it in the breaking? perhaps to teach us, that we may rather expect his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Diſtribution of his Bounty, than in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it. Scattering is the way to encreaſing, and Liberality the way to Riches. Again, 3. <hi>He gave to his Diſciples, that they might diſtribute to the Multitude;</hi> he did not do it with his own Hands, but by theirs; doubtleſs it was to gain Reputation to his Diſciples from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the ſame Courſe doth Chriſt take in Spiritual Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions. He that could feed the Souls of his People im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the Hand of his Spirit, chooſes rather by the Hand of his Miniſters to divide the Bread of Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. The Reality and Greatneſs of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; <hi>They did all eat, and were filled;</hi> they did eat, not a Crumb or a Bit, but to ſatiety and fulneſs. All that were hungry did eat, and all that did eat were ſatisfied; and yet twelve Baskets of Fragments remain. More is left than was at firſt ſet on. 'Tis hard to ſay which was the greateſt Miracle, the miraculous eating, or miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Leaving. If we conſider what they eat, we may wonder that they left any thing; if what they left, that they eat any thing. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> Theſe <hi>Fragments,</hi> tho' of Barly Loaves and Fiſh Bones <hi>muſt not be loſt,</hi> but <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up;</hi> the great Houſe-Keeper of the World will not allow the Loſs of his Orts: We muſt exerciſe Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Enjoyment of the greateſt Plenty. Lord! how tremendous will their Accounts be, who having large and plentiful Eſtates do conſume them upon their Luſts, how will they wiſh they had been born to Poverty and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when they appear to make up their Accounts before God!</p>
               <p n="15">15 ¶ When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf alone.</p>
               <p>Here we have <hi>obſervable,</hi> the wonderful Effect of the foregoing Miracle; the People ſeeing ſo many thouſands fed with five Loaves, were ſo tranſported that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Jeſus was certainly the promiſed Meſſias. Now the Notion they had of the Meſſias was this, That he ſhould be a temporal Prince, that ſhould ſubdue all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under his Feet, and particularly free the Jews from the Slavery of the Roman Yoke, which was now upon their Necks; forgetting what our Saviour had often told them, that his Kingdom was not of this World, but within Men; and that his Buſineſs was to free Men from Soul-Slavery, not from civil Subjection: However, upon this Miſtake, the Jews here in a furious Zeal deſigned to take Chriſt by force, and make him their King; but our Saviour (who came not into the World to diſturb the Order of Civil Government) underſtanding their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions withdraws himſelf into a Mountain to avoid giving the leaſt occaſion for any ſuch Jealouſie or Suſpicion. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That altho' Jeſus Chriſt be the great King of his Church, and doth exerciſe a Spiritual Kingdom in it, yet he came not into the World to be a temporal King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor was his Kingdom of this World; or ever deſigned to be prejudicial to the Thrones of Princes, and Civil Government of Men. Therefore doth Chriſt withdraw himſelf and refuſe all this Offer, as no ways agreeable to him, or conſiſtent with his deſign.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And when even was <hi>now</hi> come, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples went down unto the ſea, 17 And en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a ſhip, and went over the ſea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Capernaum: and it was now dark, and Jeſus was not come to them. 18 And the ſea aroſe, by reaſon of a great wind that blew. 19 So when they had rowed about five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or thirty furlongs, they ſee Jeſus walking on the ſea, and drawing nigh unto the ſhip: and they were afraid. 20 But he ſaith unto them, It is I, be not afraid. 21 Then they
<pb facs="tcp:46556:137"/> willingly received him into the ſhip: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the ſhip was at the land whither they went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The great danger the Diſciples were in, and the Difficulties they encounter with, after they had enjoyed the ſweet Priviledge of Chriſt's gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them. They were toſſed upon a tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sea. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is not unuſual after ſweet Refreſhments and Manifeſtations from Chriſt unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to meet with a ſtormy and ſharp Exerciſe of Faith and Patience; ſuch was the Lot of the Diſciples here; a conſtant Gale of Sweetneſs and an uninterrupted Courſe of Proſperity and Happineſs, as it is not to be expected here; ſo neither can it be injoyed here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great peril and danger. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. What haſte our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour makes towards his Diſciples when they were toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon a tempeſtuous Sea; <hi>Jeſus drew nigh to the Ship.</hi> Nothing can ſeparate between, nor keep Chriſt from his Children and People in a ſuffering Hour. He that waded through a Sea of <hi>Wrath</hi> to ſave his People, will walk upon a Sea of <hi>Water</hi> to ſuccour and relieve them, in an Hour of Tribulation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The Diſciples not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt, nor knowing him to be their Saviour, were afraid of him. Chriſt may be coming to ſave his People and they not able at preſent to diſcern and apprehend him; but their Fears may be higheſt when their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer and Deliverance is neareſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. How ſpeedily Chriſt relieves them and their Fears, by telling them who he was; <hi>It is I, be not afraid.</hi> It is a ſufficient ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in all our Afflictions to be aſſured of Chriſt's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Preſence with us. Say but Oh Saviour! <hi>It is I:</hi> and then let Evils do their worſt; that one word, <hi>It is I:</hi> is ſufficient to allay all ſtorms, and to calm a thouſand Tempeſts. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> VVith what Joy and Gladneſs the Diſciples received and entertained Chriſt in this Hour of their Diſtreſs; <hi>They willingly received him into the Ship.</hi> Tho' the Company of Chriſt is always ſweet and welcome to his Diſciples and Friends, yet never is it ſo very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and deſirable to them as in the Hour of Tryal and Temptation. Then they willingly receive him, and joyfully welcome and entertain him.</p>
               <p n="22">22 ¶ The day following, when the people which ſtood on the other ſide of the ſea, ſaw that there was none other boat there, ſave that one whereinto his diſciples were entred, and that Jeſus went not with his diſciples into the boat, but <hi>that</hi> his diſciples were gone away alone: 23 (Howbeit there came other boats from Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias, nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks) 24 When the people therefore ſaw that Jeſus was not there, neither his diſciples, they alſo took ſhipping, and came to Capernaum, ſeeking for Jeſus. 25 And when they had found him on the other ſide of the ſea, they ſaid unto him, Rabbi, when cameſt thou hither? 26 Jeſus anſwered them, and ſaid, Verily verily I ſay unto you, Ye ſeek me, not becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 27 Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you: for him hath God the Father ſealed.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having wrought the foregoing Miracle; feeding five thouſand with five Loaves, the People followed him in Troops from Place to Place. Chriſt who knew their Hearts tells them plainly what was their end: They followed him indeed, but not for any Spiritual Excellencies they ſaw in him, or Soul-Advantages they expected from him, but for Bread; only to have their Bellies fed with the Loaves, not their Souls ſatisfied with the Bread of Life.

Aug.</hi> How natural is it for Men to ſeek Chriſt for Siniſter Ends and By-Reſpects? but to ſeek him only for outward Advantages, is the baſeſt of By-Ends, and that which the Soul of Chriſt exceedingly abhors. <hi>Labour not for the Meat that periſheth.]</hi> This Prohibition muſt not be underſtood abſolutely, but comparatively; not as if Chriſt intended to take them off from their lawful Labours and the Buſineſs of their Calling; but his meaning is, labour not in the firſt and chief Place for worldly Things which are all periſhing, but for Bread for your Souls to live eternally by; even for the Food of my heavenly Doctrine which will make them that feed upon it Immortal, and this the Son of Man ſtands ready to give unto you; <hi>for him hath God the Father ſealed;</hi> that is, by a Special Commiſſion and Authority hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him to diſpenſe all Spiritual Bleſſings to them that want and crave them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That all the Things of this Life are periſhing and fading. The beſt of outward Comforts and Enjoyments are Meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth. 2. That it is the greateſt of Follies to labour intenſely and inordinately for, and to ſet our ſelves with all our might and ſtrength to perſue and follow after periſhing things. 3. That Jeſus Chriſt, his Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, his heavenly Grace, is Food which neither pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth nor diminiſheth, how many ſoever partake of it; but makes all that partake thereof, to be Partakers of Eternal Life therewith. 4. That Jeſus Chriſt is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, ſealed and commiſſioned, by his Father to give eternal Life to ſuch as induſtriouſly labour after him, and will not be ſatisfied without him: <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed:</hi> That is, Jeſus Chriſt was ſealed to the Office of a Mediator, by God the Father: Chriſt was ſealed at his Baptiſm; ſealed by his Doctrine; ſealed by his Miracles; ſealed by his Reſurrection; ſealed by his Unction or Supereminent and Unparalleled Sanctification. Lord! where will the Rejecters of Chriſt then appear at the great Day, who have deſpiſed the Authority of him, whom the Father commiſſioned to give eternal Life, to whom ſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Then ſaid they unto him, What ſhall we do, that we might work the works of God? 29 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</p>
               <p>Here the Jews who were ſtrict Obſervers of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and reſted thereupon for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inquire of our Saviour what they ſhould do that they might pleaſe God. Chriſt directs them to the great Duty of believing on himſelf, to own and acknowledge him to be the True Meſſias, and as ſuch to rely upon him alone for Salvation; <hi>This is the work of God that ye believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That for a penitent, humbled Sinner to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt it is a work highly pleaſing and acceptable unto God. Chriſt calls Faith <hi>the work of God,</hi> upon a threefold Account; it is the Work of his Efficiency and Operation; 'tis the work of his commanding; and 'tis the work of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and Acceptation; a work that God is highly pleaſed with, and greatly delighted in: <hi>This is the work of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30 They ſaid therefore unto him, What ſign ſheweſt thou then, that we may ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thee? what doſt thou work? 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the deſert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</p>
               <p>Here the Jews tell our Saviour, that before they will believe in him, they muſt ſee ſome Sign from him to confirm his Doctrine, and prove him to be the Meſſias: They acknowledge Chriſt had wrought a great Miracle in feeding five thouſand Perſons with five Barley Loaves; but <hi>Moſes</hi> fed their Fathers in the Wilderneſs, who were no leſs than ſix hundred thouſand Perſons, with excellent Manna from Heaven, and this for forty Years together; from whence they would ſeem to conclude, that they had more reaſon to believe <hi>Moſes</hi> than Chriſt, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Moſes</hi> was but an Inſtrument to obtain by
<pb facs="tcp:46556:138"/> Prayer the Manna at the Hands of God; but Chriſt was an Agent, and that by a creating Power inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he multiplied the five Loaves to the feeding of five thouſand. <hi>Note here,</hi> 1. From the Jews requiring a Sign before they would believe, That he who publiſhes a new Doctrine to the World ought to confirm his Miſſion by ſome Miraculous Operation. 2. That God honoured <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Meſſenger, very much, and Chriſt his Miniſter much more, in that both of them wrought great and ſpecial Miracles for the Confirmation of their Miſſion. 3. That the Jews not believing Chriſt to be the true Meſſias upon ſo many Atteſtations and after his Divine Miſſion was confirmed by ſuch Miraculous Operations, rendered their Infidelity inexcuſable, and their Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy invincible.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily verily I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread from heaven: but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</p>
               <p>Upon the Jews mentioning Manna to our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour he takes occaſion to make a Compariſon betwixt himſelf the Bread of Life, and Manna the Bread of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that in three Particulars. 1. It was not <hi>Moſes</hi> that gave the Iſraelites that Manna; it was God at the Prayer of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but it was God that now offered them the Bread of Life, were they willing to accept it. 2. The Manna was not given from Heaven, that is, from the Coeleſtial Heaven, but only from the Air and Clouds, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture is called <hi>Heaven:</hi> But Chriſt the Bread of Life was given and ſent by the Father from the higheſt Heaven, even the Heaven of Glory. 3. Manna was not true Spiritual Food, effectively and of it ſelf, but bodily Food only; but Chriſt is Real and Spiritual Bread, which gives Life to loſt and dead Men, which Manna did not, could not do. And whereas Manna was peculiar to <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, Chriſt gives Life to all ſorts of Perſons, Gentiles as well as Jews: <hi>The Bread of God giveth Life unto the World. Learn hence,</hi> That as Chriſt is the Truth and Subſtance of all the Types in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo particularly the Manna was an illuſtrious Type of Chriſt. In many things they agree, and in ſome they differ. They agree in their Original, Manna came down from Heaven, ſo did Chriſt: Manna was freely given, ſo is Jeſus Chriſt the free Gift of God: Manna was not fit to be eaten as it lay in the Field, but muſt be ground in a Mill, or beaten in a Mortar, and baked in an Oven before it was fit for Food: Chriſt was ground by his Sufferings, bruiſed on the Croſs, ſcorched in the fiery O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his Father's Wrath, that he might become a fit Saviour for us. Again, as the Manna was gathered by the Iſraelites daily, and equally; it was rained down about their Tents, and every Man had his Omer. Thus is Chriſt in the Miniſtry of the Word daily offered to a loſt World, and all that believe in him ſhall ſhare alike in the Benefits of Juſtification, Sanctification and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from him: But now the Manna and Chriſt differ in this; and the Truth excells the Type thus. There is a quickening, inlivening Vertue, a Life-giving, and a Life-upholding Power in Chriſt the Bread of Life, which was never found in Manna the Bread of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And wheras Manna only fed the Body, the Body of an Iſraelite, and this only for a little time in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Chriſt nouriſhes the Soul; the Souls of all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, be they Jew or Gentile, Bond or Free, and this not for time, but for Eternity; <hi>the Bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34 Then ſaid they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 35 And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt. 36 But I ſaid unto you, that ye alſo have ſeen me, and believe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the carnal Jews hearing the Bread which Chriſt had commended ſo highly, and conceiving of it carnally, deſire they may partake of it conſtantly; <hi>Lord, evermore give us of this Bread.</hi> The Commendation of Spiritual Things may move the Affections, and quicken the Deſires of Natural Perſons; but if their Deſires be not Spiritual and Serious, Diligent and Laborious, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Abiding, they are no Evidence of the Truth of Grace. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Chriſt diſcovers another excellent Effect of this Bread of Life, which he had been recommending; that ſuch as feed of it <hi>ſhall never hunger more;</hi> that is inordinately; after the periſhing Satisfactions of this World; but ſhall find an All-ſufficient Fulneſs in him, and compleat Refreſhment from him, for the preſerving and perpetuating of their Spiritual Life; <hi>He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. How juſtly Chriſt upbraids the Jews for their obſtinate Infidelity; <hi>Ye have ſeen me,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>yet ye believe not.</hi> Ye have ſeen me in the Fleſh, you have heard my Doctrine; you have ſeen my Miracles, I have done amongſt you thoſe Works which never any Man did, to convince you that I am the Meſſiah; yet you will not own me to be ſuch, nor believe on me: Oh the Strength of Infidelity and Unbelief! The Devil has as great an Advantage upon Men by making them ſtrong in Unbelief, as God hath by making his People ſtrong in Faith.</p>
               <p n="37">37 All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having lamented the obſtinate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of the Jews in the foregoing Verſe, who though they had ſeen him, would not believe on him, he doth in this Verſe comfort himſelf with the aſſured Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there would be a number which ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly come unto him; <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1. An Account of the Perſons that ſhall come to Chriſt: <hi>All that the Father hath given him.</hi> There is a double Gift of us to Chriſt. 1. In God's Eternal Purpoſe and Counſel. 2. In our Effectual Vocation and Calling: When our Hearts are by the Holy Spirit of God, perſwaded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to accept of Chriſt as he is freely tendred to us in the Goſpel. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The gracious Entertainment which Chriſt gives to thoſe that come unto him: <hi>He will in no wiſe caſt them out;</hi> where the Poſitive is included in the Negative; <hi>I will not caſt them out;</hi> that is, I will kindly receive and graciouſly entertain them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That both God the Father and Chriſt his Son are unfeignedly willing, and cordially deſirous of, the Salvation of loſt Sinners. That federal Tranſaction which was betwixt the Father and the Son from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting about the Salvation of loſt Sinners, evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares this. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the merciful and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Jeſus will in no wiſe caſt out or reject, but kindly entertain and receive every penitent Sinner that doth believingly apply unto him for Pardon of Sin and Eternal Life; <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> that is, I will not caſt them out of my Pity and Compaſſion; out of my Love and Affection; out of my Prayer and Interceſſion, out of my Care and Protection: I will not caſt them out of my Covenant; I will never caſt them out of my Kingdom; for my Nature inclines me, my Promiſe binds me, and my Office as Mediator engages me to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="38">38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. 39 And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, I ſhould loſe nothing; but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day. 40 And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life: and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>In theſe Words our Saviour gives us the Confirmation of the foregoing Promiſe, That he will in no wiſe caſt out thoſe that come unto him, by aſſuring us that it was the great End for which he came into the World. His
<pb facs="tcp:46556:138"/> Father ſent him to do his Will, and not his own; that is, not to do his own Will without his Father's, but to do his own Will and his Father's. For Chriſt as God had a co-ordinate. Will with his Father's, and as Man, a Will ſubordinate to the Will of his Father. Now it was the Will both of Father and Son, that ſuch as Believe in him ſhould be preſerved from periſhing, and be raiſed up by Chriſt at the laſt Day. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> 1. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtands not only inclined by his own Mercy and Goodneſs to Save Repenting and Believing Sinners; but doth alſo ſtand obliged thereunto by vertue of a Truſt committed to him from the Father. Therefore Chriſt mentions the Will of him that ſent him, as a Reaſon of his Fidelity in this matter. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the Father's Will, and good pleaſure is the original Source, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and firſt Spring; from whence the Salvation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers doth proceed and flow. <hi>It is the Fathers Will that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and Believeth on him may have Everlaſting Life. Learn,</hi> 3. That ſuch as are given to Chriſt by the Father, and put as his Truſt into his Keeping, he looks upon them as his Charge; and ſtands engaged for the Preſervation of them. <hi>This is my Father's Will, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> Yet has the Father ſo committed the Care of Believers to his Son, as that he keeps them ſtill in his own hand. <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>My Father which gave them to me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers Hand. Learn,</hi> 4. From thoſe words, <hi>I will Raiſe him up at the laſt Day;</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is Truly, Eſſentially and Really God. That perſon who can by his own Almighty Power raiſe the Dead, muſt certainly be God: but this Chriſt had. He raiſed others from the Dead, and his own Dead Body from the Grave alſo, by his own Power. And therefore Chriſt ſays, <hi>I am the Reſurrection, and the Life; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Doubtleſs he that ſpake theſe words, and made thoſe promiſes, knew his own Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; and that Power muſt be Omnipotent, and that Act of Omnipotence, doth prove him to be God. 'Tis true, the Diſciples raiſed the Dead, who yet were no Gods; but with this difference, they raiſed the Dead by Chriſt's Power; but Chriſt raiſed others and himſelf alſo by his own Power.</p>
               <p n="41">41 The Jews then murmured at him, becauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaven. 42 And they ſaid, Is not this Jeſus the ſon of Joſeph, whoſe father and mother we know? how is it then that he ſaith, I came down from heaven? 43 Jeſus therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto them, Murmur not among your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Altho' Chriſt had in the foregoing Verſes, plainly Aſſerted himſelf to be the True Bread that came down from Heaven, for the Benefit of the World; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtanding his words carnally, are offended with him, and Murmur at him; for pretending to come down from Heaven, when they know him to be the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> They underſtood nothing of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of his Miraculous Conception by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended at him. <hi>Thence Learn,</hi> That Ignorance of Chriſt's Divine Nature was the Ground and Occaſion of that Contempt which was caſt upon his perſon. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve farther,</hi> The proof which Chriſt gave of his Divine Nature, in his knowing the Hearts and Thoughts of theſe murmuring <hi>Jews. Jeſus ſaid, Murmur not among your ſelves.</hi> Chriſt knows and obſerves the moſt ſecret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and repinings that are found in the Breaſts of the Children of Men; and this his Knowledge, is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Proof of his Divinity, that he is truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally God.</p>
               <p n="44">44 No man can come to me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent me, draw him: and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>In which words we have ſomething neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and ſomething poſitively expres'd. The miſery of Man in his Natural and Unſanctified State is here implied; he is far diſtant from Chriſt, and unable of himſelf to to come unto him. By Nature we are Strangers, yea Enemies unto God. Enemies to the Holineſs of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to the Righteouſneſs of his Laws: And as the State of Unregeneracy is a State of Enmity; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt it be a State of Impotency; <hi>without me,</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays Chriſt) <hi>ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. That is, without intereſt in me, and influences of Grace derived from me. Again, the Truths we have expreſt are theſe. 1. That all thoſe who come unto Chriſt are drawn unto him. 2. That the drawing of ſinful Souls unto Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſpecial and peculiar Work of God: This drawing is a powerful Act, but not a Compulſory Act. God doth not draw any againſt their wills to Chriſt; but he inclines the Will of Sinners to come unto him. He draws by effectual perſwaſion, and not by violent Compulſion. 3. That all thoſe who are drawn to Chriſt here, ſhall be raiſed up Gloriouſly by him hereafter. <hi>I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Such as are brought to Chriſt by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Chriſt will never abandon them, till he has raiſed them up at the laſt day, and preſented them Blameleſs and Compleat before his Father; where they ſhall ever be with the Lord.</p>
               <p n="45">45 It is written in the prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God. Every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 46 Not that any man hath ſeen the Father, ſave he which is of God, he hath ſeen the Father. 47 Verily verily I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Bleſſed Saviour Confirms his former Aſſertion, concerning his Father's drawing from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the Old Teſtament; which ſpeaking of the days of Meſſias, foretold that perſons ſhould be Taught of God to Embrace the Meſſias; whence Chriſt inferreth, that every one who is thus Taught will come unto him, and Believe in him. <hi>Learn hence.</hi> 1. That the Teachings of God are Abſolutely neceſſary to every Man that cometh unto Chriſt in the way of Faith. 2. That ſuch ſhall not miſcarry in the way of Faith, who are under the ſpecial Teaching and Inſtructions of God; <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> and he Teacheth to profit, and that not only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, but efficaciouſly and effectually. Thoſe whom God undertakes to Teach, Receive from him both an Ear to hear, and an Heart to underſtand. They ſhall be all Taught of God, and they that are taught, have heard and learned of the Father.</p>
               <p n="48">48 I am that bread of life. 49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderneſs, and are dead. 50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 51 I am the living bread, which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever: and the bread that I will give, is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes, our Bleſſed Saviour Reſumes his former Doctrine, <hi>Namely,</hi> That he is the Object of Saving Faith, and the Bread of Life which he compares with the Manna, the Bread of <hi>Iſrael. Your Fathers did eat Manna in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> which Manna was an Illuſtrious Type of Chriſt. Thus, both came down from Heaven; both were freely given of God, without any merit or deſert of Man; both in a miraculous manner, both at firſt unknown what they were, and whence they came. Both equally belonging to all, both ſufficient for all, Poor and Rich. The Manna white in colour, ſo clear our Lord's Innocence. Pleaſant like Honey, ſo ſweet are his Benefits; Beaten and Broken before eaten. Chriſt on his Croſs bleeding and dying; given only in the Wilderneſs, and ceaſing as ſoon as they came into the Land of Promiſe; as Sacraments ſhall Vaniſh, when we enjoy the Subſtance in Heaven. But tho' Manna was thus excellent, yet the eaters of it were dead; but ſuch as feed upon Chriſt, the Bread of Life, ſhall live Eternally in Bliſs and Glory. <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven, if any man eat of this
<pb facs="tcp:46556:139"/> Bread he ſhall live for ever. Here we Learn,</hi> 1. What a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable Creature Man naturally is, in a pining and ſtarved Condition, under the want of Soul-food. 2. That Jeſus Chriſt is the food of Souls, which quickens them that are Dead, and is unto the needy Soul all that it can need; ſuch Spiritual food, as will prove a Remedy and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt Death, both Spiritual and Eternal. <hi>I am the living Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="52">52 The Jews therefore ſtrove amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us <hi>his</hi> fleſh to eat? 53 Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily verily I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 54 Whoſo eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day. 55 For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: ſo, he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me. 58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread, ſhall live for ever. 59 Theſe things ſaid he in the ſynagogue, as he taught in Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtanding Chriſt after a Carnal manner, were offended at what he ſaid; for they thought it was Inhumane to eat Man's Fleſh, and could not underſtand how the Body of Chriſt could in ſuch a Senſe be Food to all the World. <hi>Hence Note,</hi> That Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perſons put a Carnal Senſe upon Chriſt's Spiritual Words, and ſo occaſion their own ſtumbling. But yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at our Saviour's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he doth not alter his words; but preſſeth more and more the Neceſſity of feeding upon him by Faith, in order to Eternal Life. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you. Learn from hence,</hi> 1. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the True Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food of all Believers. 2. That thoſe, and only thoſe who do by Faith feed upon him ſhall obtain a Life of Grace and Glory from him; if we do not by Faith feed upon him, we can have no Evidence for a Life of Grace nor Title to a Life of Glory. This place ſome Papiſts produce to Countenance their Doctrine of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and a Bodily eating and drinking of Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood in the Sacrament. But it is evident, that Chriſt Treats not of the Sacrament in this Chapter, for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was not now Inſtituted; and therefore it is not a Sacramental, but a Spiritual feeding upon Chriſt by Faith that is here meant. For this eating gives Life to the Eater; all that eat are ſaved, and all that do not eat are damned; but this is not true of a Sacramental eating; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this eating that Chriſt ſpeaks of, he makes abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to Salvation; but ſome are ſaved that never fed upon Chriſt in the Sacrament, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Thief on the Croſs. Laſtly, if it be underſtood of a Sacramental Eating and Drinking, wo be to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for denying the Cup to the Laity; becauſe Drinking of Chriſt's Blood, is made here as neceſſary as eating of his Fleſh, in order to Eternal Life. <hi>Except ye Eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and Drink his Blood ye have no Life in you. Obſerve farther,</hi> The cloſe and intimate Union which is betwixt Chriſt himſelf, and thoſe that feed upon him. <hi>He that eateth me Dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> As Meat is turned into the Eater's Subſtance, ſo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Chriſt become one, and by feeding on him, that is, by believing in him, there followeth a mutual Inhabitation. Chriſt dwelling in them and they in him; this is true of a Spiritual feeding upon Chriſt, but not of a Sacramental Eating. Nay Chriſt carries it higher ſtill, and tells us, That as there is a Real Union between the Father and him, and as the Father Lives who ſent him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aving an Eternal Fountain of Life in himſelf, and the Son Lives by the Father, having the ſame Life communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him with his Eſſence from the Father; in like manner (ſays Chriſt) he that eateth me, the ſame ſhall Live by me. All which is certainly true of our Spiritual Feeding upon Chriſt by Faith; but cannot be applied to a Corporal feeding upon him in the Sacrament, as the Papiſts would have it.</p>
               <p n="60">60 Many therefore of his diſciples, when they had heard <hi>this,</hi> ſaid, This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it? 61 When Jeſus knew in himſelf, that his diſciples murmured at it, he ſaid unto them, Doth this offend you? 62 <hi>What</hi> and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?</p>
               <p>The foregoing Doctrine of our Saviour concerning eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood ſounded ſo very harſhly, that not only the common multitude, but ſome of them that had been his Diſciples, that is, who had given up their names to follow him, could not tell how to bear them. Our Saviour Reproves their unjuſt ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at what he had ſaid. That he was the Bread which came down from Heaven; and tells them that his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven ſhould prove the Truth of his deſcent from Heaven. <hi>Hence we learn,</hi> That Chriſt's ariſing from the Grave, and Aſcending into Heaven by his own Power, is an Evident proof of his Godhead, and that he really came down from Heaven, in reſpect of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which condeſcended to be cloathed with our Fleſh. <hi>What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man Aſcend up where he was before?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="63">63 It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpeak unto you, <hi>they</hi> are ſpirit, and <hi>they</hi> are life.</p>
               <p>To convince the <hi>Jews,</hi> that our Saviour did not mean a carnal fleſhly eating of his Body, he tells them that ſuch an eating would profit them nothing; but it is a Spiritual eating of him by Faith, that bringeth that Quickning Life of which he had ſpoken. <hi>It is the Spirit,</hi> or Divine Nature <hi>that Quickneth; the fleſh</hi> or human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone ſeparated from his Godhead, <hi>profiteth nothing,</hi> and can give no Life. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt united to the Humane Nature, which adds all Vertue, Efficacy and Merit, to the Obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Humane Nature. It is <hi>the Spirit</hi> or Divine Nature of Chriſt that Quickneth, <hi>the fleſh</hi> or Humane Nature alone profiteth nothing; and therefore the carnal eating of my fleſh would do no good.</p>
               <p n="64">64 But there are ſome of you that believe not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who ſhould betray him. 65 And he ſaid, Therefore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come unto me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given unto him of my Father. 66 ¶ From that <hi>time</hi> many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having thus cleared his Doctrine, that he was the Bread of Life which came down from Heaven, and that he is not to be Carnally, but Spiritually fed upon: He plainly tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> That the true cauſe of their ſtumbling at his Doctrine, was their Ignorance and Unbelief; <hi>there are ſome of you that believe not:</hi> Upon which plain dealing of our Bleſſed Saviour's, many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Profeſſors did wholly forſake him, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied no longer with him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes who have long profeſſed Chriſt, and his Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may draw back and fall from their Profeſſion, and finally revolt from him. 2. That it is an Evil heart of unbelief, which cauſes Men to depart from Chriſt, and to make Shipwrack of their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="67">67 Then ſaid Jeſus unto the twelve, Will ye alſo go away? 68 Then Simon Peter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go?
<pb facs="tcp:46556:139"/> thou haſt the words of eternal life. 69 And we believe, and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the living God. 70 Jeſus anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71 He ſpake of Judas Iſcariot <hi>the ſon</hi> of Simon: for he it was that ſhould betray him, being one of the twelve.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour finding many of his nominal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples forſaking him, and departing from him, <hi>Asks</hi> his Apoſtles, (the Twelve) whether they would alſo go away? intimating that their Departure would go nearer to him, than the departure of all the reſt. The nearer they are from whom we receive unkindneſſes, the nearer do thoſe unkindneſſes go to our Hearts. <hi>Will you of the Twelve, alſo go away?</hi> Peter, as the mouth, and in the name of the Reſt, Anſwers, That they knew none beſides to whom they could go, and expect that happineſs which they did from him. They that go from Chriſt can never hope to mend themſelves, let them go whither they will; therefore 'tis as irrational, as it is ſinful to depart from Chriſt; <hi>who hath the words,</hi> that is, the promiſe <hi>of Eternal Life. Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> having made this profeſſion for himſelf and the reſt of the Twelve, that they would not depart from Jeſus, whom they believed to be the True Meſſias, the Son of God; Chriſt intimates to <hi>Peter,</hi> that his Charity was ſomething too large in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſo much for them all; for there was one Traytor among them, whoſe heart was as open to Chriſt as his face was to them; he meant it of <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> of whoſe perfidiouſneſs he gave them warning at this Time. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the better any Man is in himſelf, the more charitable is the opinion which he has of others. Charity inclines to believe others good, till they diſcover themſelves to be bad. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That Chriſt doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of our charitable judgment of others ſincerity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we hope and believe, tho' we happen to be miſtaken, and our judgment is not according to Truth; Chriſt knew <hi>Judas</hi> to be an Hypocrite at this time, but doth not Reprove <hi>Peter</hi> for having a better opinion of him, than he deſerved. 'Tis far better to Err on the Charitable, than on the Cenſorious hand; 'tis leſs offenſive to Chriſt, and leſs Injurious to our ſelves.</p>

               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour knowing that the Rage of the Chief Prieſts and Phariſees in <hi>Judea,</hi> and at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was grown to that height, that they were reſolved to kill him; to avoid their fury he reſolves to continue in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> and would not come into <hi>Judea</hi> at preſent, nor go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into the mouth of his Enemies; his hour not being yet come. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſo long as it was neceſſary for Chriſt to ſave and preſerve himſelf from danger; he was pleaſed to uſe the ordinary means for his own preſervation. <hi>Namely,</hi> Retirement and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf; Chriſt as God could have rid himſelf out of the hands of his Enemies, by a miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; but he uſes the ordinary means when they would ſerve the turn, and as he would not decline danger when his hour was come; ſo would he not run into danger before it was come, but uſed all prudential means and methods for his own ſafety and preſervation. <hi>He would not come into Judea, becauſe the Jews ſought to kill him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Now the Jews feaſt of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
               <p>There were Three great Feaſts which the <hi>Jews</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated every Year. <hi>Namely,</hi> The Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover, the feaſt</hi> of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and the feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles:</hi> This laſt was obſerved in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> after they had gathered in the Fruits of the Earth: whence it was alſo called the Feaſt of Ingathering: At this Feaſt they went out of their Houſes and dwelt in Booths Seven Days, in Remembrance of their living in Tents of Booths in the Wilderneſs, for Forty Years together, before they came to <hi>Canaan:</hi> Now the Inſtitution of this Feaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to call to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Remembrance their former condition in the Wilderneſs; Teaches us, how prone and ready we are to forget our Troubles, and the Mercies wherewith our Troubles have been ſweetned; when once they are paſt and over. The <hi>Jews</hi> when ſettled in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> going out of their Houſes Yearly and dwelling in Booths, did thereby teſtifie, that preſent Mercies had not made them forget former Tryals and Troubles.</p>
               <p n="3">3 His brethren therefore ſaid unto him, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence, and go into Judea, that thy diſciples alſo may ſee the works that thou doſt. 4 For <hi>there is</hi> no man <hi>that</hi> doth any thing in ſecret, and he himſelf ſeeketh to be known openly: If thou do theſe things, ſhew thy ſelf to the world. 5 For neither did his brethren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Advice which Chriſt's Brethren, that is, his Kindred, gave him to render himſelf more famous and publickly known to the World: they Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him not to tarry any longer in <hi>Galilee,</hi> an obſcure place, but go into the more Noble and Populous Country of <hi>Judea,</hi> and work Miracles there. But what high preſumption was this, in Creatures to preſcribe to Chriſt and direct him whither to go, and what to do. <hi>Obſerve</hi> 2. The Reaſon they offer for their Advice; for no Man that ſeeketh to be known openly will do any thing in ſecret, that is, if thou wilt be thought to be the Meſſias by thy working Miracles, do them not in a Corner; but go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with us, at this next Feaſt, that the Great Men may take notice of them. Such as hunt after Reputation themſelves, and are Ambitious of vain Glory and Commendation from Men; they meaſure others, even the moſt Holy and Religious by their own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſpoſitions; and wonder that others do not follow their meaſures, for gaining Reputation and Reſpect. Thus did our Lord's Brethren here, but the Wonder ceaſes if we conſult the following words, <hi>Neither did his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Believe in him.</hi> It is no new Thing for the Holieſt Servants of God to meet with great Trials from their graceleſs Friends. Chriſt met with this before us; his Kindred according to the Fleſh, not believing in him were a ſore Trial and Temptation to him. Some Martyrs have confeſt that the hardeſt works they have met withal have been to withſtand the Temptations, the Tears and Entreaties of their deareſt and neareſt Relations.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil. 8 Go ye up unto this feaſt: I go not up yet unto this feaſt, for my time is not yet full come. 9 When he had ſaid theſe words unto them, he aboad <hi>ſtill</hi> in Galilee.</p>
               <p>Here we have Chriſt's Anſwer and Refuſal returned to his Brethrens deſire; he tells them, they might go up to the Feaſt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when they pleaſed, and as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; but it was not fit for him to Appear ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Doctrine which he Taught was ſo odious to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the prevailing Power at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> he therefore Reſolves to go up privately, that he might not ſtir up the Jealouſie of the <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> but for them they were out of danger of the Worlds hatred; for being the Children of it, the World would love its own; but him it hated; becauſe he reproved its Sins. Where we may <hi>Remark,</hi> That tho' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was moſt freely willing and ready to lay down his Life for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when the Time was come, that God the Father call'd for it; yet he would not expoſe his Life to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and danger unſeaſonably. Teaching us by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as not to decline Sufferings when God calls us to them; ſo not to Tempt God by running into them, when
<pb facs="tcp:46556:140"/> we may inoffenſively avoid them. <hi>Your time is always ready, mine is not yet come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 ¶ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he alſo up unto the feaſt, not openly, but as it were in ſecret. 11 Then the Jews ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he? 12 And there was much murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people concerning him: for ſome ſaid, He is a good man: others ſaid, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 13 Howbeit, no man ſpake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How our Bleſſed Saviour who came to fulfil the Law, goes up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Jewiſh Feaſts, according to the Command of God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. <hi>Three times a Year ſhall all the males appear before me.</hi> Chriſt being made under the Law, ſheweth a punctual Obedience to the Law, and fulfilled it in his own perſon. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The different Opinion which the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> do expreſs, concerning our Saviour; ſome allowing him the Charitable Character of being a good Man: others traducing him as being a deceiver of the People. Our dear Lord we ſee when here on Earth paſſed through Evil Report and Good Report. Is it any wonder to find the Friends of Chriſt branded with Infamy and Reproach; when Chriſt himſelf paſſes under the Infamous Character of a Deceiver of the People? Some allowed him <hi>to be a good Man,</hi> but <hi>others ſaid, Nay; he deceiveth the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 ¶ Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went up into the temple, and taught. 15 And the Jews marvelled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? 16 Jeſus anſwered them, and ſaid, My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me. 17 If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or <hi>whether</hi> I ſpeak of my ſelf. 18 He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory: but he that ſeekerh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs is in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Tho' Chriſt went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, leſt he ſhould ſtir up the Jealouſie of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> againſt himſelf unſeaſonably; yet he went into the Temple and Taught publickly; his Example teaches us thus much. That altho' the Servants of Chriſt may for a time, and in ſome caſes withdraw themſelves from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended danger; yet when God calls them to appear openly they muſt do it couragiouſly, without ſhrinking; tho the danger be ſtill impending. Jeſus went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> entered the Temple and Taught. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. So Admirable was our Holy Lord's Doctrine, that the <hi>Jews</hi> marvelled how he ſhould come to the Knowledge of ſuch Divine Myſteries, conſidering the meanneſs of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They were ſtruck with Admiration, but they wanted Faith: whereas the leaſt degree of Saving Faith is beyond all Admiration without it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. Our Lord vindicates his Doctrine; telling the <hi>Jews</hi> that the Doctrine he delivered was not his own. That is, not of his own inventing and deviſing; it was no contrivance of his, nor was it Taught him by Men; but received im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Father, whoſe Ambaſſadour and great Prophet he was. Again, when Chriſt ſays, <hi>My Doctrine is not mine;</hi> that is, not only mine, but my Father's and mine. For as he was God equal with the Father, ſo he Naturally knew all his Counſels; and as Man had Knowledge thereof by communication from his Godhead. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Doctrine of the Goſpel is a Doctrine wholly from God; he contrived it, and ſent his own Son into the World to Publiſh and Reveal it. Chriſt was ſent and his Doctrine was not his own, but his that ſent him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. A double Rule given by our Saviour, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> might know whether the Doctrine he preached were the Doctrine of God. Firſt, if a Man walks uprightly, and doth the Will of God in the beſt manner according to his Knowledge; <hi>If any Man will do his Will, he ſhall know of my Doctrine whether it be of God.</hi> There is no ſuch way to find out Truth, as by doing the Will of God. The ſecond Rule by which they might know that his Doctrine was from God, was this, becauſe he ſought his Father's Glory, and not his own in the Delivery of it. <hi>He that ſeeketh his Glory that ſent him, the ſame is True. Hence Learn,</hi> That the Nature and Scope of that Doctrine which Chriſt delivered, Eminently tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to promote his own private Glory, but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of his Father, is an undoubted proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that his Doctrine was of God.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Did not Moſes give you the law, and <hi>yet</hi> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? 20 The people anſwered and ſaid, thou haſt a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 21 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 22 Moſes therefore gave unto you circumciſion, (Not becauſe it is of Moſes, but of the fathers) and ye on the ſabbath-day circumciſe a man. 23 If a man on the ſabbath-day receive circumciſion, that the law of Moſes ſhould not be broken; are ye angry at me, becauſe I have made a man every whit whole on the ſabbath-day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That our Lord having vindicated his Doctrine in the former Verſes, comes now to vindicate his practice in healing the Impotent Man on the Sabbath-day, for which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought his Life, as a violation of the fourth Commandment given by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Our Saviour tells them, That notwithſtanding their pretended Zeal for the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> they more notoriouſly broke the ſixth Commandment, by going about to kill him, an Innocent perſon, than he had broke the fourth Commandment, by making a Man whole on the Sabbath-day. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> That it is damnable Hypocriſie, when Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend great Zeal againſt the Sins of others, and do allow and tolerate worſe in themſelves. This is, for their practice, to give their profeſſion the Lye; the <hi>Jews</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our Saviour for a ſuppoſed Breach of the fourth Commandment; whilſt they are guilty themſelves of a real Breach of the ſixth Commandment. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Ignominy, and Reproach which the <hi>Jews</hi> fix upon our Bleſſed Saviour, in the heighth of their Rage and fury againſt him. <hi>Thou haſt a Devil;</hi> the King of Saints in Heaven, as well as the whole Hoſt of Saints on Earth, hath been frequently ſmitten and deeply wounded with reproach. Chriſt was reproached for our ſake, and when we are reproached for his ſake, he takes our reproach as his own. <hi>Moſes</hi> his reproach was the reproach of Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. And he eſteemed it a Treaſure, which did more inrich him with its worth, than preſs him with its weight. <hi>Eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of Egypt. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The wonderful meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, in paſſing over this Reproach and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, without one word of Reply. Guilt is commonly clamorous and impatient, but Innocence is ſilent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of miſreports. Our Saviour is not at the pains of a word to vindicate himſelf from their impotent cenſure; but goes on with his Diſcourſe, and juſtifies his own Action, in healing a Man on the Sabbath-day from the <hi>Jews</hi> own practice, in circumciſing their Children on that day, if it hapned to be the Eighth day. And the Argument runs thus. If Circumciſion may be Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to a Child on the Sabbath-day, which is a ſervile kind of Work, and Bodily Exerciſe, without blame or cenſure; why muſt I fall under Cenſure, for healing a Man on the Sabbath-day, thoroughly and perfectly, only by a word ſpeaking? <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> That the Law of doing good, and Relieving the miſerable at all Times, is a more ancient and excellent Law, than either that of the Sabbath Reſt, or of Circumciſion upon the Eighth day. A Ritual Law muſt and ought to give place to the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w of Nature, which is written in every Man's heart. As if our Lord had ſaid; If you may wound a Man by
<pb facs="tcp:46556:140"/> Circumciſion on the Sabbath-day, may not I heal One? if you may heal on that Day one Member of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, may not I make a Man whole every whit? if you be at pains to cure ſuch a one with your hand, may not I without pains cure a Man with the word of my Mouth?</p>
               <p n="24">24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing Argument, Chriſt draws an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Concluſion, that there is no making a judgment according to the firſt Appearance of Things; and that Suddenneſs or Raſhneſs, Prejudice or Partiality in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, overthrows Righteous Judgment. This is the general Application of what Chriſt had ſaid before; and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application of it as to himſelf, comes to this; <hi>Judge not according to Appearance, but judge Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, Lay aſide your prejudices againſt my Perſon, and compare theſe caſes attentively, and impartially with one another; and then ſee whether you can juſtly condemn me as a Sabbath Breaker and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit your ſelves. Such was the perfect Innocency of our Saviour's Actions, that he could and did ſubmit them to the Reaſon and Judgment of his very Enemies.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Then ſaid ſome of them of Jeruſalem, is not this he whom they ſeek to kill? 26 But lo, he ſpeaketh boldly, and they ſay nothing unto him: do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Chriſt? 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Chriſt cometh no man knoweth whence he is. 28 Then cried Jeſus in the temple as he taught, ſaying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of my ſelf, but he that ſent me is true, whom ye know not. 29 But I know him, for I am from him, and he hath ſent me. 30 Then they ſought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his hour was not yet come. 31 And many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believed on him, and ſaid, when Chriſt cometh will he do mo miracles then theſe which this <hi>man</hi> hath done?</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having vindicated both his Doctrine and Practice, and appeared publickly in the Temple, and ſpeaking boldly there, the People of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> knowing the hatred and enmity of the Chief Prieſts and Rulers againſt him, do wonder that they did not apprehend him. <hi>Learn,</hi> Almighty God doth and can preſerve his own, in the faithful diſcharge of their Duty, in ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable manner, that even their Enemies themſelves may wonder at it, and be Aſtoniſht with it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2ly, The Argument which the <hi>Jews</hi> urged againſt our Saviour's being Chriſt, and the promiſed Meſſias. <hi>Namely,</hi> That they <hi>knew whence he was,</hi> whereas <hi>when the Meſſias cometh, no man will know whence he is;</hi> now herein they Aſſert a manifeſt untruth; for tho' Chriſt in reſpect of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was prefigured by <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who was without Father or Mother, without deſcent; (that is, without any that the Scripture mentions) yet in reſpect of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, the <hi>Jews</hi> might know whence he was; for the Scripture plainly pointed out the Tribe, the Family, the Lineage, and the place of his Birth. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. That Chriſt being grieved at this impudent Cavil, doth reply unto it with much boldneſs and Zeal; he <hi>cried, ſaying, ye both know me, and know whence I am; but the Father that ſent me ye know not.</hi> That is, you know me as Man, where I was Born, and of what Family I am, but you know not my Divine Nature, nor the Father from whom I am by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation, and who hath ſent me into the World. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. What cauſeleſs Rage appeared in theſe Men againſt Chriſt, for declaring the Truth unto them; they would have taken him by Violence, had not the Power and Providence of God reſtrained them for the preſent, becauſe his time to Suffer was not yet come. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> That Violence and Perſecution againſt the Faithful Diſpenſers of the Truths of God, have been the Lot and Portion of ſuch in all Ages and Generations. Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced it; let his Miniſters expect it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 5. That altho' the Rulers at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were Angry and enraged, yet the meaner and inferiour ſort of People Believed on him, being convinced by the wonderful Miracles which he had wrought amongſt them, that he was the True and promiſed Meſſias. For ſay they, <hi>when ever the Meſſias come, he cannot do greater and more Evident Miracles then this Man hath hath done. Learn hence,</hi> That altho' the Grace of God be not enſured to, or entailed upon any ſort of People; yet ordinarily it is the meaner ſort of People with whom it prevails moſt. Many of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were Believing, when the Rulers there were Perſecuting: Men that live in Pleaſure and at Eaſe, ſee no need of dependance upon God; have little incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or deſire to farther the Goſpel, and to encourage either the Diſpenſers or Profeſſors of it; nay it is well if they do not turn Perſecutors.</p>
               <p n="32">¶ 32 The Phariſees heard that the people murmured ſuch things concerning him: and the Phariſees and the chief prieſts ſent officers to take him. 33 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and <hi>then</hi> I go unto him that ſent me. 34 Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find <hi>me:</hi> and where I am, <hi>thither</hi> ye cannot come. 35 Then ſaid the Jews among themſelves; Whither will he go, that we ſhall not find him? will he go unto the diſperſed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 36 What <hi>manner of</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this that he ſaid, Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find <hi>me:</hi> and where I am, <hi>thither</hi> ye cannot come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How enraged the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, when they heard that ſo many of the Common People were brought to Believe in Chriſt, and to cleave unto Chriſt; inſomuch that they ſent publick Officers, Armed with Authority to Apprehend our Bleſſed Saviour. <hi>The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and Chief Prieſts ſent Officers to Take him. Learn thence,</hi> That nothing more enrages the Enemies of Religion, and draws on Trouble on the Preachers and Profeſſors of it, than the ſucceſs which the Goſpel at any time meets with. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Saviour tells them, that as they deſired to be Rid of him; ſo ere long they ſhould have their deſire,; he would leave them, and go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in his Abſence they would wiſh for his Bodily preſence again, but ſhould not have it. <hi>Learn,</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of Chriſt have little cauſe to be weary of him, and to ſeek to put him away by Violence and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for their obſtinate contempt of him will cauſe him to depart from them, and finally to forſake them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How the <hi>Jews</hi> not underſtanding our Saviour's words aright, Reaſoned among themſelves, whither by Leaving of them, he meant to go into ſome <hi>Pagan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Teach the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the Myſteries of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion; which above all things they could not endure to hear. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is the Ordinary Sin of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, priviledged with the means of Grace, not to be ſenſible of any hazard or danger of Chriſt's Leaving and forſaking them: Till at laſt he forſakes them finally, and caſts them off to their inevitable and unutterable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Thus did our Lord deal with the <hi>Jews</hi> here. <hi>I go my way, and whither I go ye cannot come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37 In the laſt day, that great <hi>day</hi> of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
               <p>The feaſt of Tabernacles, (which is the ſeaſt here meant) laſted Eight days; the firſt and laſt of which were to be kept Holy, with Religious Aſſemblies and Sacrifices; and it was a Cuſtom among the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon that Solemn day, to offer up a Pot of Water unto God, which they drew out of the Fountain of <hi>Siloam;</hi> with Reference to this Cuſtom, Chriſt here cries with a loud Voice, inviting the People to fetch and draw from him, as from a Living fountain, all the Sanctifying Gifts and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:141"/> Saving Graces of the Holy Spirit. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is the Original and Fountain of all Saving Grace, whom if we Thirſt after, Repair to, and by Faith depend upon as Mediator; we ſhall certainly Receive what influences of Grace ſo ever we want and ſtand in need of.</p>
               <p n="38">38 He that believeth on me, as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</p>
               <p>Here again Chriſt Alludes to a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtom; the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont at Fountains to Build great Veſſels of Stone, and in the midſt or Belly of them to have Pipes, through which the Water paſſes. Now ſays Chriſt, Thus ſhall it be with every one that Believeth on me; he ſhall be abundantly filled with the Spirit of God, in all the Sanctifying and Saving Graces of it. Chriſt and his Holy Spirit are a Living Fountain, whoſe Waters never fail; they are not a Water-brook, but a Spring of Waters; we ſhall never miſs of the Waters of Life, if we ſeek unto and wait upon Chriſt for them. <hi>For if we Believe on him: out of our Belly ſhall flow Rivers of Living Waters;</hi> ſufficient for our ſelves, and wherewith to refreſh others.</p>
               <p n="39">39 (But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him, ſhould receive: for the holy Ghoſt was not yet <hi>given,</hi> becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified).</p>
               <p>Theſe words are the Evangeliſt, St. <hi>John</hi>'s Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon the foregoing promiſe; he tells us, That Chriſt ſpoke this of the Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit, which did Accompany the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt. <hi>For the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given,</hi> that is, not ſo plentifully given; <hi>becauſe that Jeſus was not yet Glorified. Learn hence,</hi> That altho' the Spirit was in ſome meaſure given by God, from the Beginning to good Men; yet the more plentiful effuſion of it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, till the Aſcenſion and Glorification of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="40">40 ¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this ſaying, ſaid, Of a truth this is the prophet. 41 Others ſaid, This is the Chriſt. But ſome ſaid, Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee? 42 Hath not the ſcripture ſaid, That Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 43 So there was a diviſion among the people becauſe of him. 44 And ſome of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes an Account is given of the various effects which our Lord's foregoing Sermon had upon his Hearers hearts: Some were ſo affected with it, that they Believed him to be the great Prophet promiſed to <hi>Iſrael; Deut.</hi> 18.18. Others apprehended him to be the Chriſt: Others contradict both, ſuppoſing him to be Born not at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but in <hi>Galilee.</hi> And upon this Diverſity of Opinions, there aroſe a Diviſion amongſt them: And ſome had a mind to have apprehended him, but by an over-ruling Providence they were reſtrained from the doing of it at preſent. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Diverſity of Opinions in matters of Religion, even concerning Chriſt himſelf, have been even from the beginning. Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him a Prophet, others the Meſſiah, ſome thought him neither; but a grand Impoſtor and Deceiver. Our dear Lord, when here on Earth, paſſed through evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and good Report; let his followers expect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the ſame. For Innocence it ſelf cannot protect from Slander and falſe Accuſation.</p>
               <p n="45">45 ¶ Then came the officers to the chief prieſts and Phariſees; and they ſaid unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 46 The officers anſwered, Never man ſpake like this man. 47 Then anſwered them the Phariſees, Are ye alſo deceived? 48 Have any of the rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him? 49 But this people who knoweth not the law are curſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How God reſtrained the rage and malice of Chriſt's Enemies, till his hour was come; the Officers of the Chief Prieſts, who were ſent forth with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to apprehend him, return without him; but with this Honourable mention of him in their mouths, <hi>never Man ſpake like this Man.</hi> Such is the Power of Chriſt's Doctrine, that even thoſe that come unto it with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and with a perſecuting purpoſe, may be ſurprized by it; and tho' not converted, yet bridled and reſtrained: the preaching of the Goſpel doth ſometimes reſtrain the violence of the Hand, when it works no change in or upon the Heart. Thus it was with theſe poor Officers. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That the Phariſees being more enraged at the Reaſon which the Officers gave for neglecting their Office, than for the neglect it ſelf; upbraid them that they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be ſo deceived, whereas none of the Grandees, or Learned Rabbies had owned him; only an accurſed crew of Ignorant People followed him and doated on him. <hi>Here Note,</hi> That when Chriſt came into the World, the great ones of the World not only refuſed to Believe on him, but boaſted of their unbelief, as an Argument of their Wiſdom. <hi>Have any of the Rulers believed on him?</hi> Oh no, They were too Wiſe to Believe; Faith is left to Fools, and accounted Folly by thoſe Wiſe Men. Nay farther, They count the Common People curſed, who did Believe on Chriſt. O prodigious ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity! to account them accurſed, who receive Jeſus Chriſt the cheifeſt Bleſſing: Great Men have not always the Wiſdom of a Man, but more ſeldom have they the Wiſdom of a real Chriſtian. Great in Honour and Wiſe in Underſtanding are a ſweet couple, but ſeldom ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="50">50 Nicodemus ſaith unto them, (he that came to Jeſus by night, being one of them) 51 Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doth? 52 They anſwered and ſaid unto him, Art thou alſo of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariſeth no prophet. 53 And every man went unto his own houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. How God ſtirs up <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> tho' he durſt not openly own Chriſt, yet to plead for him, that he might not be condemned before heard; this was a common Rule of Juſtice, and nothing but what might have been ſaid on behalf of the greateſt Malefactor; he could not well have ſaid leſs, but God ſo ordered it, that it was enough to divert the Storm from falling upon Chriſt at this time. One word ſhall be ſufficient to blow over a Perſecution, when God will have it ſo. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. They anſwer <hi>Nicodemus</hi> with a Taunt, a Mock, and a Scorn; that no Prophet ever did riſe out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> nor ever ſhould. Therefore Chriſt ariſing out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> as they thought could be no Prophet. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> That though they were more and more enraged, yet they ſcatter without concluding any thing againſt Chriſt, for that time every one went to his own home. There is no Wiſdom, nor Underſtanding, nor Counſel againſt the Lord.</p>

               <p n="1">1 JEſus went unto the mount of Olives: 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he ſat down, and taught them.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Chapter gave us an Account of a moſt excellent Sermon, which our Saviour Preach'd in the Temple, at the Feaſt of Tabernacles. Now the Feaſt being ended, Jeſus did not tarry in the City all Night;
<pb facs="tcp:46556:141"/> but went out of it two Miles, as he frequently uſed to do to the Mount of <hi>Olives.</hi> And altho' it was ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for him to be ſeen any more in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet early the next Morning he returns again to the City, enters the Temple, and falls upon his work of preaching with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, and with indefatigable diligence. Oh what a buſie, uſeful Life was this of our Saviour's; he ſpent the Day in preaching, in the Temple, the Night in privacy and Prayer on the Mount of <hi>Olives;</hi> and the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returns to his work of preaching again. Thus was he always holily and painfully imployed; to glorifie his Father, and to be uſeful and beneficial to Mankind, was his food by Day, and his reſt by Night. Lord, How little do we reſemble thee, if when thy Life was all Pains and Labour, ours all be Paſtime, Pleaſure, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And the Scribes and Phariſees brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a woman taken in adultery, and when they had ſet her in the midſt, 4 They ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Maſter, this woman was taken in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in the very act. 5 Now Moſes in the law commanded us, that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned: but what ſayeſt thou? 6 This they ſaid, tempting him, that they might have to accuſe him. But Jeſus ſtooped down, and with <hi>his</hi> finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. 7 So when they continued asking him, he lift up himſelf, and ſaid unto them, He that is without ſin among you, let him firſt caſt a ſtone at her. 8 And again he ſtooped down, and wrote on the ground. 9 And they which heard <hi>it,</hi> being convicted by their own conſcience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt <hi>even</hi> unto the laſt: and Jeſus was left alone, and the woman ſtanding in the midſt. 10 When Jeſus had lift up himſelf, and ſaw none but the woman, he ſaid unto her, Woman, where are thoſe thine accuſers? hath no man condemned thee? 11 She ſaid, No man, Lord. And Jeſus ſaid unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and ſin no more.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour early in the Morning entring upon the work of Preaching. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. What a mixt Auditory he had, of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and Common People. All ſorts of perſons came to hear him, but not all with the ſame intentions; the Common People came to Learn, but the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> came to Cavil and Carp; the latter came to Tempt and inſnare him, the former to be Taught and Inſtructed by him; it is not our bare attendance upon Ordinances, but the purity of our Aim, and the ſincerity of our Intentions, in waiting upon God in them; that is an Evidence of our Sincerity. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How the Hypocriſie of theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> was gilded over with an appearance of Sanctity; as if they were great lovers of Chaſtity, and haters of Uncleanneſs; they bring to Chriſt a Woman taken in a Adultery, to be cenſured by him; one that had not known theſe <hi>Phariſees,</hi> would have concluded them very Holy and Honeſt, very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable, and Conſcientious Perſons; but Chriſt that ſaw into their Boſoms, ſoon found that all this was done only to Tempt him. Thus a ſmooth Tongue, and a falſe Heart, often accompany one another; when we ſee too glittering appearances, we have reaſon to ſuſpect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The puniſhment which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſeek to have inflicted on this Adultereſs; it is Death, let her be ſtoned: Sometimes the puniſhment of Adultery was burning, ſometimes ſtoning, always Death: Lord! How ought Chriſtians to Bluſh? who have ſlight thoughts of the Sin of Adultery, which both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> held ever deadly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. Their enſnaring, Queſtion, <hi>Moſes commanded ſuch to be ſtoned, but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> deſire no better Advantage againſt Chriſt, than a Contradiction to <hi>Moſes</hi> their Received Lawgiver: It has been an old Stratagem, to ſet <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt at variance, but they are faſt Friends; they are Subordinate one to another, not oppoſite one againſt another. <hi>Moſes</hi> brings us to Chriſt, and Chriſt to Glory: Fain would theſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loguing Adverſaries draw Chriſt to contradict <hi>Moſes;</hi> that they might take Advantage of that Contradiction to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Chriſt. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 5. The Wiſdom and Caution of our Lord's Anſwer; he doth not excuſe her Crime; but bids her Accuſers look at home, and examine their own Conſciences, whether they were not Guilty of the like, or as great a Sin: He doth not ſay, Let her be ſtoned, this had been againſt the courſe of his Mercy; he doth not ſay, Let her not be ſtoned, this had been againſt the Law of Moſes; but he ſo Anſwers, that both his Juſtice and his Mercy are intire; ſhe diſmiſſed, and they aſhamed. It is a falſe Zeal that is Eagle-eyed abroad, and blind at home: Such as are moſt wicked themſelves, are oftimes moſt ready, and skilful to ſpie out the faults and failings of others: We ſtand too near our ſelves to diſcern our own miſcarriages. The Eye that ſees every thing, ſees not it ſelf. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 6. Tho' Chriſt abhorred the Sin, yet he does not condemn the Sinner. <hi>Hath no Man condemned thee? Neither do I condemn thee,</hi> ſays Chriſt. This Chriſt ſaid, not to excuſe the Woman, or to connive at her offence, but to ſhew that he declined the Office of a Civil Judge, which was to paſs Sentence on Criminals. He therefore doth not ſay, No Man ought to condemn thee: <hi>but hath no Man condemned thee?</hi> Chriſt doth not execute the Office of a Magiſtrate, in judging her to Death; but of a Miniſter, in calling her to Repentance, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: How ought every one of us to keep within the bounds of our calling, when our Saviour himſelf will not intrench upon the Office and Functions of others. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> Our Saviour's cautionary Direction to this Adultereſs, <hi>Go and ſin no more. Where Note,</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay, Go and commit Adultery no more; but <hi>Go and ſin no more.</hi> It is not a partial Repentance, or a turning away from this or that particular Sin, that will deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate us true Penitents, or intitle us to the pardoning Mercy of God; but a leaving off all Sin of what kind ſoever. Therefore, ſays Chriſt, <hi>Go and ſin no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 ¶ Then ſpake Jeſus again unto them, ſaying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life. 13 The Phariſees therefore ſaid unto him, Thou beareſt record of thy ſelf; thy record is not true. 14 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, Though I bear record of my ſelf, <hi>yet</hi> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. 15 Ye judge after the fleſh, I judge no man. 16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me. 17 It is alſo written in your law, that the teſtimony of two men is true. 18 I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and the Father that ſent me, beareth witneſs of me. 19 Then ſaid they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jeſus anſwered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo. 20 Theſe words ſpake Jeſus in the treaſury as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour having baffled the deſign which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had upon him: and ſhewed a Spirit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, in delivering himſelf from that ſnare which they had laid for him: He returns to inſtruct the People in the Treaſury. <hi>And here Note,</hi> 1. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them in the nature of his Office, which was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten all Men with the Knowledge of Divine Truth; ſo that they ſhould not walk in Darkneſs, either of Sin or Error, but be led to Eternal Life. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That
<pb facs="tcp:46556:142"/> the great End and Errand of Chriſt's coming into the World, it was to give Light unto poor Souls that ſat in Darkneſs. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Exception which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made againſt our Saviour's Teſtimony of himſelf. <hi>Thou beareſt Record of thy ſelf, thy Record is not True.</hi> Indeed ſuch is the Corrupt Nature of Man, which is prone to ſeek it ſelf, and hunt after vain Glory, that it may render a perſon's Teſtimony of himſelf ſuſpected; but Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true God that cannot Lye, and coming out of the Boſom of his Father, as his Ambaſſador; his Teſtimony of himſelf is above all Exception, and ought to be credited without farther proof. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How Chriſt challenges his Enemies the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> for judging carnally of him, and according to the meanneſs of his outward appearance; whereas <hi>he judged no Man.</hi> That is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> No Man as they judged, according to outward ſhew; or 2dly, <hi>I judge no Man,</hi> that is, at preſent, My proper work is not to Condemn any but to Teach all, and my preſent Office is that of a Prophet, not of a Judge. My coming now is to Inſtruct and Save the World, my next coming will be to Judge and Condemn it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. Chriſt declares that he is not alone in the Teſtimony given of himſelf; but that the Father did alſo Teſtifie and bear Witneſs of him: and that according to their own Law, the Teſtimony of Two was always accounted and eſteemed valid. Now ſays Chriſt, If ſo much weight be to be laid upon the Teſtimony of Two Men, how much more forcibly ſhould the Teſtimony of the Father, and of him whom the Father hath ſent ſatisfie you; that what I ſay of my ſelf is True? <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Father and the Son, tho' one in Eſſence and Operation; yet are diſtinct perſons. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That theſe diſtinct perſons did bear joint witneſs concerning Chriſt. God the Father teſtified of him by a Voice from Heaven; and Chriſt as God, bare witneſs of himſelf as Man, and as Mediatour. Surely out of the mouth of Two ſuch Witneſſes, the Truth of Chriſt's Divine Miſſion is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Then ſaid Jeſus again unto them, I go my way, and ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall die in your ſins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 22 Then ſaid the Jews, Will he kill himſelf? becauſe he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whither I go, ye cannot come. 23 And he ſaid unto them, Ye are from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world. 24 I ſaid therefore unto you, that ye ſhall die in your ſins: for if ye believe not that I am <hi>he,</hi> ye ſhall die in your ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> A dreadful Threatning denounced by Chriſt againſt the Obſtinate and Unbelieving <hi>Jews, ye ſhall die in your ſins;</hi> that is, in the Guilt of your Sins, under the Power, and undergoing the puniſhment of your Sins: Lord! what a ſad word is this, <hi>ye ſhall die in your Sins;</hi> Oh better it is a Thouſand times to die in a Ditch; for they that die in their Sins, ſhall riſe in their Sins, and ſtand before Chriſt in their Sins; ſuch as lie down in Sin in the Grave, ſhall have Sin lie down with them in Hell to all Eternity. The Sins of Believers go to the Grave before them; Sin dieth while they Live. But the Sins of Unbelievers go to the Grave with them. While they live they are dead in Sin; and by Sin they fall into Death; from which there is no Recovery unto Life. <hi>Obſerve, Secondly,</hi> The grand Sin for which this great Puniſhment is threatned, and that is the Sin of Unbelief. <hi>If ye Believe not that I am he, ye ſhall Die in your Sins.</hi> Plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of all Sins, Infidelity, or Unbelief is the grand damning Sin under the Goſpel. The Devil hath as great an advantage upon Men, by making them ſtrong in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as God hath by making his People ſtrong in Faith. Unbelief renders a Sinner's caſe deſperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable; it doth not only procure Damnation, but no Damnation like it.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Then ſaid they unto him, Who art thou? And Jeſus ſaith unto them, Even <hi>the ſame</hi> that I ſaid unto you from the beginning. 26 I have many things to ſay, and to judge of you: but he that ſent me, is true; and I ſpeak to the world thoſe things which I have heard of him. 27 They underſtood not that he ſpake to them of the Father. 28 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, When ye have lift up the the Son of man, then ſhall ye know that I am <hi>he,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> I do nothing of my ſelf; but as my Father hath taught me, I ſpeak theſe things.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> hearing our Saviour denouncing ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Threatning againſt them, becauſe they Believed not on him, in the foregoing Verſes; Here they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely ask him who he was? Our Saviour replies, That he was the ſame he was from the Beginning, even the very Chriſt, and that they were the very ſame they were alſo; the mortal Enemies and oppoſers of the Truth. But that the time was haſtning when they ſhould be fully convinced who he was. <hi>Namely,</hi> When they had lifted him upon his Croſs; when he was Riſen again and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven, and brought that deſtruction upon them, which he had ſo often threatned. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Sufferings of Chriſt were clear and convincing Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations both who he was, and what he was; the darkning of the Sun, the quaking of the Earth, the rending of the Rocks, the opening of the Graves; were ſuch convincing Proofs of his Deity, that they could not but ſay, <hi>Verily this was the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 And he that ſent me, is with me: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not left me alone: for I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>That is, he that ſent and Commiſſioned me for the great work of Redemption, he is continually with me, both to aſſiſt and to accept me; I doing every thing that is agreeable to his Holy Will and Pleaſure. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That the work of Redemption, in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, was a work well pleaſing to God the Father, the work it ſelf was highly pleaſing to him; and Chriſt's way of managing it was well pleaſing alſo. 2. That the Reaſon why it was thus pleaſing to God, was, becauſe he acted in a conſtant conformity to his Father's Will, kept to his Father's Commiſſion; and executed his Father's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Doing always thoſe things that pleaſed him. Learn,</hi> 3. That as the Father and Chriſt were inſeparable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Unity of the Divine Eſſence; So the Father was always with Chriſt as Mediatour, both to ſupport and to uphold him, to accept and to reward him. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not left me alone, either in the doing of his Will, or in the ſuffering of his Pleaſure. <hi>Learn,</hi> 4. That thoſe who deſire the gracious and ſpecial preſence of God with them in all Conditions; particularly in times of Suffering and Trouble; they muſt make it their care and ſtudy to pleaſe God, and to obſerve his Will in all things. Then God will be with them in his guiding preſence, in his ſtrengthning preſence, in his comforting, in his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in his ſanctifying, ſympathiſing and accepting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p n="30">30 As he ſpake theſe words, many believed on him. 31 Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, <hi>then</hi> are ye my diſciples indeed; 32 And ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Bleſſed Fruit and Succeſs of our Saviour's foregoing Diſcourſe, concerning his Perſon and Office. <hi>As he ſpake theſe words many Believed on him.</hi> Not by their own natural Power and Ability; but by Chriſt's omnipotent and efficacious Grace; he that ſpake to the Ear, cauſed his word to reach the Heart: Chriſt himſelf that planted and watred gave alſo the Encreaſe. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Love and Care of Chriſt mentioned to theſe new Converts; he watreth immediately theſe Plants with wholeſome Advice and Counſel. <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed.

Where Note,</hi> That Man is naturally in Bondage and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, by blindneſs of Mind, by hardneſs of Heart, by rebellion of Will. 2. That the means appointed by God for ſetting him at Liberty from this Captivity and Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is the word of Chriſt and the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>The Truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33 ¶ They anſwered him, We be Abrahams ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man: how ſayeſt thou, Ye ſhall be made free? 34 Jeſus anſwered them, Verily verily I ſay unto you, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin. 35 And the ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever: <hi>but</hi> the Son abideth ever. 36 If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How theſe Carnal <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand all that our Saviour ſaid, to be ſpoken in and after a Carnal manner; when he ſpake to them before, <hi>of eating his Fleſh and drinking his Blood;</hi> they underſtood it groſly of his natural Body. When he ſpeaks to them here of a Spiritual freedom from Sin, they underſtand it of a Civil freedom from ſervile Bondage and Subjection. Alledging, <hi>They were Abraham's Seed, and never in Bondage to any:</hi> Which was a manifeſt untruth; having been in Bondage to their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and in their own perſons to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But this was not the Bondage that Chriſt meant, but a Spiritual Slavery and Thraldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of Sin, and Power of Satan. <hi>For he that committeth Sin is the Servant of Sin.</hi> That is, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth habitually, wilfully, deliberately, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly allow and tollerate himſelf in a ſinful courſe; he is under the Servitude and Thraldom of Sin. Every Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is a Bondſlave, and to live in Sin is to live in Slavery. And this every Man doth till the Son makes him free: Then and not till then <hi>is he free indeed. Learn hence,</hi> That intereſt in Chriſt, and continuance in his Doctrine, ſets the Soul at liberty from all that Bondage, whereunto it was ſubject in its natural and ſinful State. Oh happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change from being the Devil's Slaves, to become Chriſt's Free Men.</p>
               <p n="37">37 I know that ye are Abrahams ſeed; but ye ſeek to kill me, becauſe my word hath no place in you. 38 I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have ſeen with your father. 39 They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid unto him, Abraham is our father. Jeſus ſaith unto them, If ye were Abrahams children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 40 But now ye ſeek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> boaſting again that they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and bearing themſelves much upon it; our Saviour tells them he knew they were ſo, his natural Children accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh; but not his genuine Children accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit: This he proves, becauſe they did not tread in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſteps, and do his works; for if either the Temper of their Minds, or the Actions of their Lives were agreeable to <hi>Abraham,</hi> they would not ſeek as they did to deſtroy and kill him, only for bringing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation to them; which he had heard and learned of the Father. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. How prone we are to glory in our outward Priviledges, and to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y upon them. Whereas theſe are Arguments of God's goodneſs towards us, but no evidences of our goodneſs towards him. 2. That it is very dangerous and unſafe, to pride our ſelves in, and depend upon any external priviledges and prerogatives whatſoever. As our being Born within the pale of the viſible Church, our deſcending from Pious Parents, and Holy Progenitors; for unleſs we be followers of their Faith, admirers of their Piety, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Example, we are none of their Children; but belong to another Father, as our Saviour tells the <hi>Jews</hi> in the next Verſes.</p>
               <p n="41">41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then ſaid they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <hi>even</hi> God. 42 Jeſus ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, If God were your Father ye would love me: for I proceeded forth, and came from God; neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me. 43 Why do ye not underſtand my ſpeech? <hi>even</hi> becauſe ye cannot hear my word. 44 Ye are of <hi>your</hi> father the devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>
               <p>In the former Verſes, the <hi>Jews</hi> made their Boaſt that they were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in theſe that they are the Children of God. <hi>We have one father even God.</hi> This our Saviour diſproves, Telling them, that if God were their Father, they would love him, as proceeding from him by eternal Generation; and in his Office im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him as Mediatour. Alſo if God were their Father, they would underſtand him ſpeaking from God; whereas now they were ſo tranſported with Malice, that they could not endure his Doctrine with patience, tho' it came from God. All which were undeniable proofs, that they were not the Children of God. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That none can juſtly pretend any Intereſt in God as his Children; but they that love Chriſt, as being the Expreſs Image of his Father's Perſon, and do hear and receive his Doctrine, as coming from God: This the <hi>Jews</hi> did not do, therefore ſays Chriſt, They are not the Children of God. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> Having told them whoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they are not; our Saviour tells them plainly whoſe Children they were. <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil.</hi> This appears by their being Acted by him, by their Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and Imitating of him; their Inclinations, Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Actions, being all to fulfil the Luſts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Now, as his Servants we are, whom we obey; ſo his Children we are whom we reſemble. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Men's ſinful Practices will prove them to be Satan's Children, let their Profeſſion be what it will; if in the Temper of their Minds, and in the Actions of their Lives, there be a Conformity to Satan's Diſpoſition, and a ready Compliance with his Temptations, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly his Children; what pretences ſoever they make of being the Children of God. None could pretend higher to the Relation of God's Children than theſe <hi>Jews</hi> did; yet ſays Chriſt, <hi>Ye are the Children of the Devil, for his work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. The free Reproof which Chriſt gave the <hi>Jews,</hi> for their obſtinate Unbelief. <hi>Becauſe I tell you the Truth, ye Believe me not.</hi> 2. The Challenge which he gives the worſt of his Adverſaries. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of Sin?</hi> So perfectly pure, Innocent and Spotleſs, was the Doctrine and Life of Chriſt: That altho' his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies loaded him with Slander and falſe Accuſation, yet none of them could juſtly convince him of; much leſs
<pb facs="tcp:46556:143"/> condemn him for the leaſt known Sin. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> being enraged at this free Reproof, fell a railing at his Perſon; charging him with being a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with an Evil Spirit. Our Saviour meekly replies, That he did not deal with the Devil; but was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father in what he did, and ſaid; And therefore his Father would take care of his honour, and judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them. <hi>Here Note,</hi> That tho' Chriſt uſed ſome ſharpneſs in Reproving the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Repreſenting them to themſelves; yet he anſwers with wonderful mildneſs and meekneſs, when he diſcovers his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own Reproaches: How cool was Chriſt in his own Cauſe, but hot enough in Gods.</p>
               <p n="51">51 Verily verily I ſay unto you, If a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death. 52 Then ſaid the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou haſt a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou ſayeſt, If a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never taſte of death. 53 Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makeſt thou thy ſelf? 54 Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, If I honour my ſelf, my honour is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye ſay, that he is your God: 55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I ſhould ſay, I know him not, I ſhall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his ſaying.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The bleſſed Fruit and effect of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Saviour's Doctrine; <hi>He that keeps my ſaying ſhall never ſee Death:</hi> that is, Shall be ſecured from Eternal Miſery, and enjoy Eternal Life. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How the <hi>Jews</hi> miſunderſtood our Saviour's words, <hi>He that keeps my ſaying ſhall never ſee Death;</hi> as if he meant a freedom from Temporal Death, and hereupon they looked upon him as beſide himſelf, to promiſe a Priviledge which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor the Prophets did ever enjoy. Whereas it was not Exemption from Temporal Death; but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Eternal Deſtruction, which our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that keep his ſayings. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That the miſunderſtanding of Chriſt's Doctrine and taking it in a Carnal Senſe, has given occaſion for the many Cavils and Objections made againſt it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How Chriſt clears himſelf of all Ambition in this matter, and ſhews that he did not make this promiſe of delivering his followers from Death vain-gloriouſly; but that God whom they called their Father, had honoured him with Power, to make good what ever he had promiſed to them that keep his ſaying. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That as Chriſt intirely ſought his Father's Glory; ſo the Father conferred all Honour and Glory upon Chriſt as Mediatour; thereby teſtifying, how infinitely pleaſed he was with the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind performed by him. <hi>If I honour my ſelf my honour is nothing, it is my Father that honoureth me.</hi>

What a falſe and Ridiculous conſtruction the <hi>Jews</hi> make of our Saviour's words, as if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that he had ſeen <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> him, with bodily Eyes; whereas Chriſt only aſſerted that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſeen his Day; that is, he foreſaw by Faith the Day of his Incarnation and coming in the Fleſh. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Saviour's poſitive aſſerting of his Divinity, or that he had a Being as God from all Eternity; for ſays he, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am. Where Note,</hi> That Chriſt doth not ſay, Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, I was; but <hi>Before Abraham was, I am;</hi> which is the proper name of God, whereby is ſignified the Eternal duration and permanency of his Being. The Adverſaries of Chriſt's Divinity, ſay that before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, Chriſt was; that is, in God's fore-knowledge or Decree; but this may be ſaid of any other perſon, as well as Chriſt, that he was in the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God before <hi>Abraham</hi> was Born. Whereas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it was Chriſt's deſign in theſe words, to give himſelf ſome preference and advantage above <hi>Abraham,</hi> which this Interpretation doth not in the leaſt do. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve laſtly.</hi> How the <hi>Jews</hi> looking upon Chriſt as a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, for making himſelf equal with God, and for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting his Eternal Exiſtence; they make a Zealous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon his Life, by taking up Stones to caſt at him, as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to deal with Blaſphemers; but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour delivers himſelf miraculouſly from their fury, and eſcapes untouched. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That when Arguments fail, the Enemies of Truth betake themſelves to force and violence. <hi>They took up Stones to caſt at him.</hi> 2. That as Chriſt diſappointed his own Perſecutors, ſo he can and will deliver his People in their greateſt extremity from the Perſecutors Rage and Fury. 2.

               <p n="1">1 ANd as <hi>Jeſus</hi> paſſed by, he ſaw a man which was blind from <hi>his</hi> birth.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Chapter acquainted us with a famous Encounter, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had with our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> This being ended, as he paſſed from the Temple, he ſaw a Man lying; poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the High-way, who was Born Blind: Him Chriſt pitches upon as an object fit to exerciſe his Divine Power, in the cure and healing of. They that are Blind by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty, may poſſibly be relieved by Art and Induſtry; but to cure one that is Born Blind, nothing leſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than an Almighty Power. <hi>Learn hence.</hi> That Diſeaſes and Diſtempers, which are incurable by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Nature, are not inſuperable to Chriſt's Power, nor impoſſible for him to help, but a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for him to magnifie his Power upon. Therefore is it here Recorded, that this poor Man was Blind from his Birth; ſuch Blindneſs being accounted incurable by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And his diſciples asked him, ſaying, Maſter who did ſin, this man, or his parents that he was born blind?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> Something implied or ſuppoſed. <hi>Namely,</hi> 1. That all Bodily Afflictions and Calamities do come upon us for Sin. Whereas Afflictions, tho' they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fall upon a Sinner, yet are they not always ſent for Sin; but by way of Purgation and Prevention of Sin. 2. It is here ſuppoſed, that as ſome Afflictions come upon Men for perſonal Sins, ſo others come upon them for Parental Sins, and that Children may and oftimes do, very juſtly ſuffer for their Parents Sins. 3. It is here ſuppoſed, that there is no other Reaſon of a perſon's ſufferings but only Sin: Whereas tho' Sin be much and often the cauſe of ſuffering, yet we may wrong God and Man; yea and Sin too, to conclude, it is always the cauſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. 4. It is implied here, That there is a Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls, from one Body to another; the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſuppoſed, that this Soul, when it was in another
<pb facs="tcp:46556:143"/> Body ſinned, and was now puniſhed by being put into a Blind Body. This Pythagorean Error was crept in among the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the Diſciples here ſeem to be tainted and infected with it. This may Teach us, how far the Holieſt and Wiſeſt of Men are from an Infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that the Beſt Men may be miſled by a common Error.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Jeſus anſwered, Neither hath this man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor his parents: but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt's Anſwer muſt not be underſtood Abſolutely, as if he denied this Man and his Parents to be guilty of Sin, for both he and they had Sin enough, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Temporal Blindneſs, but Eternal darkneſs. The meaning is; That in Afflicting this Man, the Lord did not ſo much Reſpect his or his Parent's Sin, as the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his own Glory, in this miraculous Cure. Chriſt doth not deny but that a Man's own Sin, and the Sin of his Parents may be the procuring cauſe of Blindneſs; but that neither the one nor the other was the cauſe in that Man's caſe; but that the Power and Mercy of God might be ſeen in Reſtoring this Man to his Sight, therefore was he Born Blind. <hi>Whence Note,</hi> 1. That tho' Sin be always the deſerving, yet is it not always the procuring cauſe of Affliction. 2. That we ſeldom think of, or hit upon, any other cauſe of Affliction, but only Sin; tho' the deſign of God looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sin of Man in Afflictions; yet Man ſeldom looks beyond that, or thinks of any other deſign of God in Afflicting, but only puniſhing for Sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work. 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour tells his Diſciples, that he was ſent by God into the World, and had a great work aſſigned him by God, during his abode in it: <hi>Namely,</hi> To Inſtruct, Reform and Save Mankind; and what our Saviour ſays of himſelf, is Applicable to every one of us, in a lower Senſe we are ſent into the World to work out our own Salvation in the firſt place, and then to promote the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of others as much as in us lies. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That every one has a work to do in the World, a great work aſſigned him by God that ſent him into it. 2. That the Time allotted for the finiſhing and diſpatching of this great work, it is a limited Time, it is a ſhort Time; our working Seaſon is a ſhort Seaſon; <hi>While it is Day.</hi> 3. That after the working Seaſon is paſt and expired, there will ſucceed a Night of Darkneſs, in which there muſt be a ceſſation from work. <hi>The Night cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 When he had thus ſpoken, he ſpat on the ground, and made clay of the ſpittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 7 And ſaid unto him, Go waſh in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and waſhed, and came ſeeing.</p>
               <p>Two things concurred towards the Cure of this Blind Man. <hi>Namely,</hi> An act of Divine Power on Chriſt's part, and an act of Faith and Obedience on the Man's part. 1. An act of Divine Power on Chriſt's part, he Tempers Clay and Spittle together, and Anoints the Man's Eyes therewith, and behold he ſees. What an improbable remedy and means was this, to Humane Reaſon! Much fitter to put out a ſeeing Man's Eyes than to cure a Blind Man's: Had Chriſt pull'd out his Box, and Applied ſome Medicinal Oyntment to his Eyes; then the praiſe had been aſcribed to his Skill, not to his Power: But now it plainly appeared, that all the vertue was in Chriſt, not in the means. Lord! What great things canſt thou do by weak and unlikely means; yea by oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary means. But it is the praiſe of Omnipotency to work by Improbabilities. From the Contemptibleneſs of the means or Inſtrument, always redounds the greater honour to the Agent. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. An act of Faith and Obedience on the Man's part. <hi>He went his way, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Eyes in the Pool of Siloam and returned ſeeing. Where Note,</hi> 1. How Chriſt delights to exerciſe and try the Faith of his People, by their ſubjection and Obedience to diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult commands. 2. That true Faith joined with ſincere Obedience, never faileth the expectation of them that exerciſe it; eſpecially in obeying the moſt hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult commands. Therefore the Evangeliſt addeth, that the Blind Man after waſhing <hi>Returned ſeeing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 ¶ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had ſeen him, that he was blind, ſaid, Is not this he that ſat and begged? 9 Some ſaid, This is he: others <hi>ſaid,</hi> He is like him: <hi>but</hi> he ſaid, I am <hi>he.</hi> 10 Therefore ſaid they unto them, How were thine eyes opened? 11 He anſwered and ſaid, A man that is called Jeſus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and ſaid unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and waſh: and I went and waſhed, and I received ſight. 12 Then ſaid they unto him, Where is he? He ſaid, I know not.</p>
               <p>The Blind Man thus miraculouſly cured, returns with much Joy to his Neighbours and Acquaintance, who confer with him upon this matter; they enquire whether he was the perſon cured or not: who was the perſon that cured him, and where that perſon was? He aſſures them he was the very perſon, that was Blind, but now cured; that he that cured him was Jeſus, that the means uſed was Clay and Spittle, but where this Jeſus was, or what was become of him he knew not. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the miraculous cures of God, work a ſenſible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in Men; not only in their own Apprehenſion but in the judgment of others. This Miracle ſhined forth among the Neighbours, who having ſeen and obſerved the Blind Man, admire his healing. <hi>Learn.</hi> 2. How frankly the Blind Man acknowledges, and how freely he confeſſes that he was the perſon whom Jeſus had heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I am he.</hi> It is an unthankful ſilence to ſmother the works of God in an affected ſecrecy; to make God a loſer by his bounty towards us, is a ſhameful injuſtice. Oh God we are not worthy of thy common favours, much leſs of Spiritual Bleſſings, if we do not publiſh thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on the Houſe Top, and praiſe thee for them in the great Congregation.</p>
               <p n="13">13 ¶ They brought to the Phariſees him that aforetime was blind. 14 And it was the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day when Jeſus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 15 Then again the Phariſees alſo asked him how he had received his ſight. He ſaid unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I waſhed, and do ſee. 16 Therefore ſaid ſome of the Phariſees, This man is not of God, becauſeth he keepeth not the ſabbath-day. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaid, How can a man that is a ſinner, do ſuch miracles? And there was a diviſion among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the <hi>Jews</hi> who ſhould have been full of ſilent wonder, and inclined to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo omnipotent an Agent, are prejudiced againſt him, and bring the late Blind Man before the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> our Saviour's profeſſed Enemies. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The time which our Saviour choſe for working this cure; it was on the Sabbath; many if not moſt of Chriſt's famous Miracles were wrought upon the Sabbath-day. Upon that Day he cured the withered Hand. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. Upon that Day he cured the impotent Man, at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 5. Upon that Day he cured the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind Man here. Thus Chriſt did: probably for two Reaſons. 1. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Doctrine which he Preach'd on that Day, by Miracles; therefore his preaching and working Miracles went together. 2. To Inſtruct the <hi>Jews,</hi> (had they been willing to Receive inſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion) in the true Doctrine and proper Duties of their Sabbath; and to let them know that works of Neceſſity and Mercy are very conſiſtent
<pb facs="tcp:46556:144"/> with the due Sanctification of the Sabbath: It his hard to find out any time wherein Charity is unſeaſonable; for as it is the Beſt of Graces, ſo the works of it are fitteſt for the beſt of Days.</p>
               <p n="17">17 They ſay unto the blind man again, VVhat ſayeſt thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He ſaid, He is a prophet. 18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his ſight, until they called the parents of him that had received his ſight. 19 And they asked them, ſaying, Is this your ſon, who ye ſay was born blind? how then doth he now ſee? 20 His parents anſwered them and ſaid, We know that this is our ſon, and that he was born blind: 21 But by what means he now ſeeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age, ask him, he ſhall ſpeak for himſelf. 22 Theſe words ſpake his parents, becauſe they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that if any man did confeſs that he was Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the ſynagogue 23 Therefore ſaid his parents, He is of age, ask him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How deſirous the Phariſees were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Glory of this famous Miracle which Chriſt had wrought: In order to which, 1. They Re-examine the Man, to know what his Thoughts were of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had done this for him: They judged him to be an Impoſtor and a great Sinner, the Man declares freely, That he believed him to be a Prophet. <hi>Hence we learn,</hi> That there may be, and ſometimes is, more True Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt in one poor Man, than in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Learned Rabbies. This blind Man ſaw Chriſt to be a Prophet, when the Jewiſh Sanhedrim ſaw nothing in him but Impoſture. <hi>This Man is not of God,</hi> ſays the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; <hi>Verily he is a Prophet,</hi> ſays the blind Man. 2. They next examine his Parents (being unwilling to believe the Man himſelf) whether he was their Son or not; if ſo, whether he were born blind, and if born blind, by what means he now ſees. Lord! what obſtinate and wilful blindeſs was found in theſe Phariſees? How do they cloſe their Eyes and ſay, We will not ſee? What En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are here uſed to ſmother a Miracle which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably proved Chriſt to be the expected Meſſias? They examine firſt the Man, then his Parents, then the Man again, hoping that being over awed with fear, they would either deny or at leaſt conceal the Truth; but the more they ſtrove to darken and obſcure the Truth, the more conſpicuous and evident they made it. <hi>Great is Truth and will prevail,</hi> how many ſoever oppoſe it and ſet themſelves againſt it. <hi>Obſerve next,</hi> The Wiſdom and Cautiouſneſs of his Parents Anſwer, they expreſly own that the blind Man was their Son: That he was born blind, but for the way of his cure they wave that, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly becauſe they did not ſee the Cure wrought, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sentence of Excommunication, a Decree being paſt among the Rulers, that <hi>whoſo confeſſeth Chriſt ſhould be put out of the Synagogue. Hence Learn,</hi> 1. That Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or Separation from the Society of the People of God is an Ancient and Honourable Ordinance in the Church of God, and as ſuch to be revered and eſteemed. 2. That this Ordinance of God has been and may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by wicked Men, and the Edge of it turned againſt Chriſt himſelf and his ſincereſt Members. 3. That the fear of unjuſt Excommunication muſt not diſcourage Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from confeſſing the Truth, when called to it. The Parents of the Blind Man durſt not confeſs Chriſt, <hi>for fear that they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and ſaid unto him, Give God the praiſe: we know that this man is a ſinner. 25 He anſwered and ſaid, Whether he be a ſinner <hi>or no,</hi> I know not: but one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I ſee. 26 Then ſaid they to him again, What did he to thee? how open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he thine Eyes? 27 He anſwered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <hi>it</hi> again? will ye alſo be his diſciples? 28 Then they reviled him, and ſaid, Thou art his diſciple; but we are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diſciples. 29 We know that God ſpake unto Moſes: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>
               <p>Here we have an Account of the Phariſees farther pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing upon this blind Man to rob Chriſt of the Glory of this Miracle; firſt they inſinuate with him, and then they frown upon him. Firſt they inſinuate with him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Give God the praiſe.</hi> As if they had ſaid, Aſcribe the Cure to God, not to this Man, whom they conclude to be a Sinner, becauſe he broke (as they thought) the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. 'Tis no new thing to ſee Men pretend to aim at the Glory of God, when at the ſame time they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly oppoſing Chriſt, and perſecuting his Members. Next they attempt to frown this poor Man into a Denial of the Miracle wrought upon him, or to perſwade the People that it was a Cheat; but it is wonderful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how the Boldneſs and Confidence of the poor Man increaſed. God giving him that Wiſdom and Courage which all his Adverſaries were not able to reſiſt or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay. Therefore the Phariſees being angry at this Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Man, they revile him for being ſo ſilly as to become a Diſciple to Chriſt whoſe Office and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they knew not, whereas they were Diſciples of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom they knew God ſpake unto. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſuch as are led by Malice and prepoſſeſt with Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, will not only think baſely of his Perſon, but refuſe to ſee the cleareſt Evidences of his Authority and Commiſſion. <hi>As for this Fellow,</hi> ſay the Malicious Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, <hi>we know not whence he is,</hi> or who gave him his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p n="30">30 The man anſwered and ſaid unto them, Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <hi>yet</hi> he hath opened mine eyes. 31 Now we know that God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſinners: but if any man be a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of God, and doth his will, him he heareth. 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes the blind Man proceeds to vindicate our bleſſed Saviour who had cured him of his Blindneſs from the Exceptions of the Phariſees, and endeavours by ſolid Arguments to convince them that his Cure (being born blind) was truly miraculous, and conſequently proved Chriſt to be of God. 1. The Man admires that Chriſt having wrought ſuch a Miracle upon him, they ſhould be ignorant of his Authority. <hi>This is marvellous, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine Eyes.</hi> 2. He lays down a general Propoſition, that no Deceiver or falſe Teacher is heard of God, or inabled by him to work ſuch Miracles at theſe, but only ſuch faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as do his Will are thus extraordinarily Aſſiſted by him. <hi>We know that God heareth not Sinners;</hi> that is, ſuch as love and delight in Sin, ſuch as are in a State of Sin, and go on in a Courſe of Sin; God will not hear ſuch, or anſwer the Prayers of ſuch. Indeed God ſometimes hears a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Prayers in Wrath, and refuſes to hear a Saints Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Mercy: But he never denies a Saints Prayers in <hi>wrath,</hi> or hears a Sinners Prayers in <hi>mercy.</hi> The Propoſition <hi>laid down</hi> is an eternal Truth. <hi>God heareth not Sinners;</hi> that is, ſo long as they purpoſe to continue ſinners, and go on in a Courſe of Sin, and remain bold and preſumptuous Sinners. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That none that live in a Courſe of Sin, can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect that God ſhould hear them, and give in an Anſwer of Prayer to them. <hi>God heareth not Sinners: But if any Man be a Worſhipper of God, and doth his Will, him
<pb facs="tcp:46556:144"/> he heareth;</hi> that is, If a Man feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs, him the Lord accepteth, heareth and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> 1. That ſuch as would be heard of God and accepted with him, muſt be devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of him. 2. That it is not enough to prove Men <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Accepted with God,</hi> that they are devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of him, unleſs they walk in Obedience to him, and do his Will. <hi>If any Man be a Worſhipper of God, and doth his Will, him he heareth. Obſerve,</hi> 3. How the blind Man goes on to prove that Chriſt had a ſpecial Authority from God and an extraordinary Preſence of God with him in what he did, becauſe he had done ſuch a Work, as was never done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or by any of the Prophets, or by any Perſon whatſoever ſince the Creation of the World. From whence he wiſely and well infers, that Chriſt was a Perſon authorized by and ſent of God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Chriſt having done that which was never done before, (<hi>namely,</hi> to give Sight to one that was born blind) was an Evidence of his Omnipotency. 2. That this Act of Omnipotency proved him to be God. Whatever Miracles the Prophets wrought, they wrought them by Chriſt's Power, but Chriſt wrought this and all other Miracles by his own Power.</p>
               <p n="34">34 They anſwered and ſaid unto him, Thou waſt altogether born in ſins, and doſt thou teach us? And they call him out. 35 Jeſus heard that they had caſt him out; and when he had found him, he ſaid unto him, Doſt thou believe on the Son of God? 36 He anſwered and ſaid, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A ſpecial Inſtance of Phariſaical Pride; they account this poor Man a vile Perſon, whom Heaven had marked by his Native Blindeſs for ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Wickedneſs. How prone are we to judge them the greateſt Sinners, whom we obſerve to be the greateſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. From reviling they proceed to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating; <hi>They caſt him out;</hi> that is, out of Communion with the Jewiſh Church. Oh happy Man who having loſt a Synagogue, haſt found Heaven. Behold this blind Man and admire him for a reſolute Confeſſor, ſtoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Gracious Author of his Cure, againſt the Cavils of the Phariſees, and maintaining the Innocence and Honour of ſo bleſſed a Benefactor. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Regard to this blind Man, whom the Phariſees had ſet at naught and excommunicated: <hi>He finds him out;</hi> reveals himſelf more fully to him, and directs him to believe in him. <hi>Where obſerve,</hi> That the Miracle which Chriſt had wrought upon the blind Man did not convert him, and work Faith in him; till Chriſt revealed himſelf unto him, and enabled him to diſcern the Truth of what he revealed. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Miracles confirm Faith, but Miracles alone cannot work Faith. The blind Man had experienced a Miracle wrought upon him, yet remains an Unbeliever, till Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am he. Obſ.</hi> 4. How readily the Man receives the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith upon the forementioned Revelation of himſelf unto him: He inſtantly ſaid, <hi>Lord, I believe;</hi> and in Teſtimony thereof <hi>worſhips him;</hi> that is, as God incarnate, as God manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Fleſh. <hi>Thence learn,</hi> That true Knowledge of the Son of God, will beget Faith in him, and true Faith in him, will be productive of Homage and Adoration, of Obedience and Subjection to him. He that knows Chriſt aright, will believe, and he that believes will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and obey: <hi>He ſaid, Lord, I believe, and he worſhipped him.</hi>

               <p n="39">39 ¶ And Jeſus ſaid, For judgment I am come into this world: that they which ſee not, might ſee; and that they which ſee, might be made blind.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour declares not the Intentional deſign, but the Accidental event of his coming into the World. <hi>Namely,</hi> 1. That thoſe who were Blind might receive Sight. 2. That thoſe who preſume they ſee, and know more than others, for their deſpiſing the Goſpel, and ſhutting their Eyes againſt the light of it, ſhould be left in darkneſs, and by the juſt judgment of God be more and more blinded. Thoſe who ſhut their Eyes willfully againſt the cleareſt light, and ſay they will not ſee; it is juſt with God to cloſe their Eyes judicially, and ſay they ſhall not ſee.</p>
               <p n="40">40 And <hi>ſome</hi> of the Phariſees which were with him, heard theſe words, and ſaid unto him, Are we blind alſo? 41 Jeſus ſaid unto them, If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin: but now ye ſay, We ſee; therefore your ſin remaineth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who watched all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to inſnare our Saviour, look upon theſe laſt words as reflecting upon them; as if Chriſt did inſinuate that they were blind. <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> They that ſhut their Eyes and will not ſee the light which Chriſt offers to them, are the worſt of blind ones. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Saviour's Reply to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Queſtion, <hi>If ye were Blind;</hi> that is, ſimply ignorant of your Duty, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means of Knowledge and Inſtruction; <hi>you ſhould have no ſin;</hi> that is, comparatively to what you now have, you ſhould not have had ſo much ſin and guilt upon you as now you have, by ſhutting your Eyes againſt the Light. <hi>But now you ſay we ſee,</hi> that is, being puft up, with the Knowledge which you have, as if you were the only Men that ſaw; this proud conceit of yours renders your condition incurable, and <hi>your ſin remaineth</hi> unpardonable. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That it is a far greater ſin to contemn the known Laws of God, than to be Ignorant of them; Pride is a greater hinderance of Knowledge than Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe the proud Man thinks, he wants no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 2. That the moſt exalted Knowledge is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Salvation, without a ſuitable and correſpondent practice. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> had the Key of Knowledge at their Girdle; yet our Saviour tells them of a double Damnation: Lord! How ſad is it ſo to know Chriſt in this World, as that he will be aſhamed to know us in another World.</p>

               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour having in the end of the foregoing Chapter, upbraided the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for their Blindneſs and Ignorance in the Myſteries of Religion, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the high conceit which they had of their own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: He proceeds in this Chapter farther to convince them, that they were Blind, Leaders of the Blind; tho' they thought and look'd upon themſelves, as the only Guides and Teachers of the People. And in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he propounds before us a Parable of the true and falſe Shepherd, which repreſents a good and bad Paſtor and Teacher; and gives us a fourfold mark and character of a good Shepherd. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The <hi>Good Shepherd enters in by the Door;</hi> that is, he has his Vocation and Miſſion from Chriſt, he comes into the Church Regularly, in a right and approved way and manner; not by any clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine methods or indirect means. <hi>To him the Porter openeth;</hi> that is, the Holy Spirit who openeth the Hearts of Men to Receive Jeſus Chriſt and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which the Faithful Shepherds deliver in his Name, and by Authority Received from him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That all Faithful Paſtors have a lawful call to the work of the Miniſtry: They enter by the right door, and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:145"/> execute their Truſt in a right manner; but ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Call from God, unwarrantably thruſt themſelves into the Miniſtry; they are no better, nor no other <hi>than Thieves and Robbers</hi> in God's Account. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Another property of a good Shepherd, is this, <hi>That he calleth his Sheep by their names.</hi> This importeth Three things; 1. A ſpecial Love that he bears to them. 2. A ſpecial care that he has over them. 3. A particular Acquaintance with them, that he may know how to apply himſelf ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to them; which tho' it be eminently verified in Chriſt, yet is it the Duty of every Faithful Paſtor, and under-Shepherd in his meaſure to labour after. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. <hi>The good Shepherd leads out his Sheep into good Paſtures;</hi> that is, he feedeth them with ſound Doctrine; nouriſhes them with the word of Life. Whereas the hireling or falſe Shepherd, whatever he may do for his own ſake, he has no regard to Jeſus Chriſt; to the honour of his Perſon, to the Edification of his Church, or the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls; but his deſign is to raiſe and inrich himſelf, and ſo he may compaſs that, he cares not how many Souls periſh thro' his neglect. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the good Shepherd here mentioned, is this, <hi>That he goeth before his Sheep,</hi> as the Shepherd doth before his Flock; <hi>Namely,</hi> By a holy Life and unblameable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: He treads out thoſe ſteps before the People which they are to take in their way towards Heaven. <hi>And the Sheep follow him,</hi> and are guided by him. <hi>He lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his Sheep and goeth before them, and the Sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</hi>

               <p n="7">7 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them again: Verily verily I ſay unto you, I am the door of the ſheep. 8 All that ever came before me, are thieves and robbers: but the ſheep did not hear them. 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall go in and out, and find paſture. 10 The thief cometh not, but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <hi>it</hi> more abundantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Character which Chriſt gives of himſelf, <hi>I am the door of the Sheep;</hi> that is, the only way and means, by which Sinners have acceſs to God, and can obtain Salvation; the only door by which Sinners are entred into the Kingdom of Grace, and admitted into the Kingdom of Glory. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That there is no poſſible way of Acceſs to God, for fallen Man, but by Jeſus Chriſt. As there is no way of entring the Houſe but by the Door, and thoſe that ſo enter are ſafe, in like manner, ſuch as come unto God thro' Jeſus Chriſt in the way of Faith and Holy Obedience, ſhall be put into a ſecure Condition, and at laſt obtain Eternal Salvation. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The end and deſign of Chriſt in coming into the World, aſſerted and declared by himſelf; <hi>I am come that they might have Life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> But had not his People Spiritual Life before he came into the World? Yes, he gave Life to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before his coming, in a meaſure ſufficient to ſupply their Neceſſity; but ſince his coming, he gives it in ſuch a ſuperabounding meaſure as may teſtifie his Divine Bounty; they ſhall not only barely Live, but Live <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly;</hi> that is, their Spiritual Life ſhall abound thro' the upholding, ſtrengthning, quickning, and comforting preſence of my Holy Spirit; for having conveyed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life unto his People, in their Regeneration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; he will cauſe it to encreaſe more and more in their Sanctification, until it arrive at a compleat perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Glorification. <hi>Obſerve laſtly,</hi> The Character which our Saviour gives of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and of thoſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, which went before him in particular; he ſtiles them <hi>Thieves and Robbers. All that ever came before me, were Thieves and Robbers. Obſerve,</hi> He doth not ſay, All that were ſent before me, but <hi>all that came before me,</hi> were Thieves and Robbers. So that Chriſt doth not ſpeak this of the true Prophets, who were ſent by God before him; but of the falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, that came of themſelves without any Commiſſion from God. The meaning is, all perſons that came before me, pretending to be what I am, the true Meſſias; as did <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee, &amp;c.</hi> they were Thieves and Robbers. That is, they only ſought their own Advantage, while they deceived and ruin'd you. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That whoever took upon them the Office and Perſon of the Meſſiah before Chriſt, or whoſoever have ſince Uſurp'd a lawful calling in his Church without his Commiſſion, they are in Chriſt's account no better than Murtherers, Thieves and Robbers; and they ought to be ſo in the Peoples eſteem. <hi>The Sheep did not hear them.</hi>

               <p n="11">11 I am the good ſhepherd: the good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd giveth his life for the ſheep. 12 But he that is an hireling and not the ſhepherd, whoſe own the ſheep are not, ſeeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the ſheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and ſcattereth the ſheep. 13 The hireling fleeth, becauſe he is an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and careth not for the ſheep. 14 I am the good ſhepherd, and know my <hi>ſheep,</hi> and am known of mine. 15 As the Father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, even ſo know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the ſheep.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes our Saviour Evidently proves himſelf to be the true Shepherd of his Church, by the Marks and Signs, by the Properties and Characters of a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, which were eminently found with him. <hi>Namely,</hi> To know all his Flock; to take care of them, and to lay down his Life for them. 1. Jeſus Chriſt the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of his Church, hath an exact and diſtinct Knowledg of all his Flock; <hi>I know my Sheep,</hi> with a threefold Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with a Knowledge of Intelligence and Obſervation; he knows them ſo as to obſerve and take notice of them; with a Knowledge of Approbation and Acceptation; he knows them ſo as to approve and own them; and with a knowledge of Care and Protection; he knows them ſo as to defend and keep them. Thus Chriſt knows his Sheep, <hi>and is alſo known of them.</hi> That is, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on, beloved, and obeyed by them. 2. <hi>He lays down his Life for his Flock:</hi> And for this, doth he emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently deſerve the Title of the good Shepherd. (As for his Power he is ſtiled the great Shepherd.) A good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd indeed, who not only gives Life to his Sheep; but gives his own Life by way of Ranſom for his Sheep. This Example of Chriſt, the Great and Good Shepherd, in laying down his Life for his Sheep; teacheth all Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and Inferiour Shepherds to prefer the Good of their Flock, even before their own Lives.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold: them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice; and there ſhall be one fold, <hi>and</hi> one ſhepherd.</p>
               <p>Here Chriſt proves himſelf to be the True Shepherd of his Church, from another property of a good Shepherd, which is to take care for increaſing and inlarging of his Fold, by bringing in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to it; and by breaking down the Partition wall, to make one Church both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Chriſt calls the <hi>Gentiles</hi> his <hi>other Sheep,</hi> by way of Anticipation; becauſe ſhortly they were to be ſo, and united together with the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> into one Sheep-fold; and whereas he ſays, He <hi>Muſt</hi> bring theſe Sheep in, we are to underſtand it not of a Neceſſity of Coaction, but of a Neceſſity of Compact: It being a federal Agreement, betwixt the Father and himſelf; that both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhould be one Flock, incloſed in one Fold, and preſented to his Father as a Glorious Church. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> How endearing our Obligations are to the Deareſt Jeſus, that he ſhould account us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were afar off, his Sheep, (we being ſo in reſpect of his Eternal purpoſe) and make it his Care, and eſteem it his Charge, to call us home, and bring us in, to his Fold the Church, that we might be ſaved amongſt the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the True <hi>Iſraelites. Other Sheep I have which are not of this Fold, them alſo I muſt bring.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here Note,</hi> 1. That Jeſus Chriſt certainly foreknew his own Death and Reſurrection. 2. That Chriſt was a Voluntier in Dying, <hi>he layed down his Life:</hi> none could have taken it from him. 'Tis true, his death was a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, but a voluntary Sacrifice; he died violently, but yet voluntarily: The hand of his Enemies could never have hurt him without his own conſent. 3. That as Chriſt died voluntarily with reſpect to himſelf, ſo in a way of Subjection to his Father's command. <hi>This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have I Received from my Father.</hi> 4. That this voluntary Submiſſion of Chriſt to die for us, was the ground of the Father's Love to him. <hi>Therefore doth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Love me: becauſe I lay down my Life.</hi> Altho' the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had many Reaſons to love the Son, yet none was ſtronger, than this Obedience of his to Death: even the curſed death of the Croſs, for the Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of loſt Sinners; therefore did the Father love him with a more exceeding love, becauſe he laid down his Life for his Sheep.</p>
               <p n="19">¶ 19 There was a diviſion therefore again among the Jews for theſe ſayings. 20 And many of them ſaid, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 21 Others ſaid, theſe are not the words of him that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
               <p>Here the Evangeliſt ſhews what different effects this Sermon of our Saviour had upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> many of them do calumniate and ſlander him, as one poſſeſſed and mad, and therefore not to be heard and minded: others of calmer thoughts ſaid, That the Doctrine he taught, and the late Miracle which he had wrought, in curing the blind Man, were abundantly ſufficient to confute ſuch a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſlander. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Doctrine of Chriſt meeting with diverſity of diſpoſitions, it is no wonder that it occaſions different effects, to the ſoftning of ſome and hardning of others; even as the ſame Sun that melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Wax hardneth the Clay; yet is not this to be imputed to the Doctrine of our Saviour, but to Mens corruptions which oppoſe the Truth, and the maintainers of it. <hi>There was a Diviſion again amongſt them.</hi>

                  </gap>h by <hi>Solomon,</hi> was deſtroyed by the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> yet when the Temple was rebuilt, there was one like it which retained the Ancient name. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Debate it ſelf. <hi>If thou be the Chriſt tell us plainly.</hi> Not that they affected the Knowledge of the Truth, but only deſigned to inſnare him; for if he had affirmed himſelf to be the Meſſias, he had brought himſelf in danger of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> expected the Meſſias to be a Temporal Prince, that ſhould deliver them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. Now if Chriſt had declared himſelf ſuch a Meſſias as the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, it might have coſt him his Life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his hour not being yet come, he anſwers with his uſual Prudence and warineſs to their inſnaring queſtion. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt's Enemies are full of ſubtil poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and can turn themſelves into all ſhapes, that if poſſible they may intrap and enſnare him; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they pretend here, great earneſtneſs of deſire to be ſatisfied, whether he were indeed the true and promiſed Meſſias; when in truth they had another deſign. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 4. The Wiſdom and Caution of our Saviour's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he refers them to his Miracles. <hi>The works that I do in my Father's Name, they bare witneſs of me.</hi> Our Saviour's miraculous works were ſufficient for the <hi>Jews,</hi> to have grounded and bottomed their Faith upon, and to have confirm'd them in the belief, that he was the promiſed and expected Meſſias; had not Prejudice, Obſtinacy and Malice, blinded their Eyes, that they could neither ſee, nor conſider. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> How Chriſt points out to theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> the true cauſe of their Infidelity; which was, not the obſcurity of his Doctrine, but their not being of his Sheep; that is, not as yet converted, they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Properties of his Sheep, which he ſets down in the following Verſes. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Mens final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief under the means of Faith, is a clear Evidence of their being in a loſt and periſhing condition. Infidelity is the Sin that doth conſign a Man over to Damnation; and to ſuch as ſet under the Goſpel, doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Damnation, but no Damnation like it.</p>

                  <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1. That all ſincere and faithful Chriſtians are Chriſt's Sheep, and he is their great and good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. This Relation implies tender Affection, powerful Protection, plentiful Proviſion. The tenderneſs of Chriſt's Affection towards his Sheep appears by pitying their Infirmities, by having a Fellow-feeling with them in their Sufferings, by ſuiting their Temptations to the Degrees of their Graces. His Care in providing for them appears, in affording to them the Holy Scriptures, the Miniſtry of the Word, the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Operation of his Holy Spirit to make all efficacious and effectual to them. His Protection of them diſcovers it ſelf by preparing them for Tryals, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them under them, and by delivering them out of them, and by ſanctifying all to them, cauſing them to work together in ſubſerviency to his own Glory and his People's Good. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That Chriſt's Sheep hear Chriſt's Voice and anſwer the Call of their great Shepherd. They hear the Voice of Chriſt ſpeaking to them in the Scriptures, in the Miniſtry of the Word, in their own Conſciences, in Providences, and they hear Chriſt's Voice ſpeaking to them, in and by his Holy Spirit; and as they hear Chriſt's Voice, ſo do they anſwer his Call; now the right Anſwer to the Call of Chriſt in the Goſpel is a preſent Anſwer, a willing Anſwer, and an abiding Anſwer. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. That all Chriſt's Sheep do follow him their Shepherd. They follow him, 1. In
<pb facs="tcp:46556:146"/> his Doctrine. And, 2. In his Example. In his Contempt of the World, in his Freedom in reproving Sin, in the Holyneſs and heavenly-mindedneſs of his Converſation, in his Meekneſs and Patience, in Charity and Univerſal Goodneſs, and as he was a mighty Pattern of Prayer. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. That Chriſt the great and good Shepherd knows all his Sheep. <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and I know them.</hi> He knows them ſo as to diſtinguiſh them, ſo as to obſerve and take Notice of them, ſo as to own and approve them, ſo as to take Care of them and provide for them. And as the Lord knoweth who are his, ſo he knoweth who are not his too: As he knows his Sheep, ſo he knows the Goats alſo, and their Place will be at his left Hand. <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and I know them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28 And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. 29 My Father which gave <hi>them</hi> me, is greater than all: and none is able to pluck <hi>them</hi> out of my Fathers hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Promiſe made by Chriſt unto his Sheep, namely the Promiſe of Eternal Life and of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Grace till they come to the full Fruition of it in Glory. <hi>I give unto them eternal Life, and none ſhall pluck them out of my Hand. Obſ.</hi> 2. The Confirmation he gives of this from his own and his Father's power, which is employed, engaged and concerned for them, and for their perſeverance and preſervation, notwithſtanding all Oppoſition to the contrary. <hi>My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and no Man is able to pluck them out of my Father's Hand. Learn,</hi> 1. That eternal Life is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Sheep. 2. That eternal Life is the Gift of Chriſt. 3. That eternal Life is now given to Chriſt's Sheep; they have it now in the purchaſe, in the promiſe and in the firſt Fruits. 4. That all Chriſt's Sheep are put by God the Father into Chriſt's Hand for Security; <hi>My Father hath given them me.</hi> 5. The Father doth ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt Chriſt with his Sheep, as yet to take Care of them himſelf, they are in the Father's Hand, as well as in the Sons, and their being in the Hands of both, doth aſſure them of the certainty of their Perſeverance. <hi>None ſhall pluck them out of my Hand; None ſhall be able to pluck them out of my Father's Hand,</hi> implying, that there are many that would pluck them out of their Hands, Sin, Satan, the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>They ſhall be kept by the Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, through Faith unto Salvation;</hi> for who can be too ſtrong for omnipotent Power?</p>
               <p n="30">30 I and my Father are one.</p>
               <p>That is, one in Eſſence and Nature, one in Authority and Power, and not barely one in Will and Affection, or one in Concord and Conſent. That this is the Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Signification of the Words appears by a threefold Argument, 1. From the Original Words; it is not ſaid, I and my Father are (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) one Perſon, in the Maſculine Gender, but in the Neuter (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) I, and my Father are one thing: Now if that Thing be not the Divine Being, they cannot be one, for ſince the Father is confeſſed to be God, the Son cannot be one thing with the Father, if he be not God too. 2. It appears from the Context our Saviour in the preceding Verſes aſcribed the Preſervation of his Sheep to the Power of his Father; <hi>None can pluck them out of my Father's Hand;</hi> and he aſcribes it alſo to his own Power, <hi>None ſhall pluck them out of my Hand;</hi> plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that his Sheep were equally ſafe in his own Hand, as well as in his Father's, for, ſays he, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> that is, one in Power; and if they be one in Power, they muſt be one in Nature, unleſs we make an Almighty Creature, which is a Contradiction. 3. It appears evidently by what Follows in the next Verſe that the Jews underſtood our Saviour in this Senſe, why elſe did they take up Stones to ſtone him? <hi>We ſtone thee,</hi> ſay they, <hi>for Blaſphemy, becauſe thou being a Man, makeſt thy ſelf God.</hi> The Jews took up our Saviour's meaning aright, and were ſatisfied, that when he ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> he aſſerted himſelf to be God, and deſerved to dye, and well he had deſerved it, if he had not been God. The Adverſaries of our Saviour's Divinity to elude the Force of theſe Words which make ſo much againſt them, interpret the Words thus, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> that is, ſay they, we are (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) one in Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one in Concord and Conſent: This is a Truth, but not the great Truth contained in theſe Words, for thus Believers are one with God and one with another, <hi>Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> by an Harmony of Wills and Deſires; ſo far as they are regenerated, God's Will and theirs are Uniſons, they will and deſire the ſame thing, and are of one Heart and of one Mind. But God and Chriſt are one in a much higher Senſe than Chriſt and Believers are one, <hi>namely,</hi> one in Eſſence and Nature, one in Authority and Power, being Conſubſtantial with God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is for Nature, Coeſſential; for Dignity, Coequal; and for Duration, Coeternal with the Father. 2. That although Chriſt be one in Eſſence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet are they diſtinct Perſons one from Another, <hi>I and my Father, we are one.</hi> 3. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Son being one in Eſſence, one in Power, one in Conſent and Will with the Father, they are both equally concerned for the Perſeverance of the Saints, for preſerving them in Grace and for bringing them to Glory. <hi>None ſhall pluck them out of mine or my Father's Hand;</hi> for <hi>I and my Father are One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31 Then the Jews took up ſtones again to ſtone him. 32 Jeſus anſwered them, Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father; for which of thoſe works do ye ſtone me? 33 The Jews anſwered him, ſaying, For a good Work we ſtone thee not; but for blaſphemy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelf God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How the Jews underſtood our Saviour affirming, that he and his Father were one; that is, one in Eſſence and Nature, and himſelf a Perſon equal with God. This they lookt upon as Blaſphemy in him to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to himſelf what is proper to God only. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That the Jews lookt upon it as a Piece of Juſtice in them to ſtone Chriſt for this apprehended Blaſphemy. <hi>Then the Jews took up Stones to ſtone him.</hi> According to the Law of God, the Blaſphemer was to be ſtoned to death, but then he was firſt to be judicially tryed and judged: But ſuch was the furious and fiery Zeal of theſe Jews that in a tumultuous Manner they attempt to ſtone him to death. Lord! how far doth the fury of Men in oppoſing Truth, out-ſtrip the True Zeal of thy faithful Servants in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Truth. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. With what Meekneſs our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives this horrid Indignity of ſtoning (for it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſome Stones were caſt at him, he ſaying, <hi>For which of theſe Works do you ſtone me</hi>) He clears his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and expoſtulates with them for rewarding him Evil for Good. <hi>Many good Works have I ſhewed you from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> that is, by my Father's Authority and Commiſſion, I have been ſight to the Blind, Feet to the Lame, a Tongue to the Dumb, and Hearing to the Deaf. Do any of theſe Works deſerve ſuch Uſage as ſtoning at your Hands? <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſuch was the perfect and ſpotleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Chriſt in all his Actions, that he durſt and did appeal to the Conſciences of his moſt inveterate Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; <hi>For which of theſe Works do you ſtone me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34 Jeſus anſwered them, Is it not written in your law, I ſaid, Ye are gods? 35 If he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the ſcripture cannot be broken: 36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and ſent into the world, Thou blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeſt; becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour, by a twofold Argument, vindicates himſelf from the Imputation of Blaſphemy, in aſſerting himſelf to be God. 1. Becauſe the Old Teſtament gave to Magiſtrates and Judges the Title of Gods, as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are Gods.</hi> Now Chriſt argues ſtrongly from the leſs to the greater, thus, If Judges and Magiſtrates may be called Gods, becauſe they are commiſſioned by him and derive their Authority from him; how much more is that Title due to me, who was ſanctified, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:46556:146"/> and ordained for a Mediatour, and appointed to the Work of Redemption, before I came into the World, and conſequently was God from all Eternity. This Place the Socinians (thoſe profeſſed Adverſaries of our Saviour's Godhead) produce, to prove, That Chriſt was not God by Nature, but only in reſpect of his Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Miſſion. It is a certain Truth, That he that was ſanctified and ſent was the Son of God; but he was not therefore the Son of God, becauſe ſanctified and ſent. His Sanctification was not the Ground of his Sonſhip; but his Sonſhip was the Cauſe of his Sanctification. Chriſt was not therefore God's Son, becauſe he was ſanctified and ſent, but he was therefore ſanctified and ſent, becauſe he was his Son. He was a Son before he was ſent, even from Eternity; otherwiſe it muſt have been ſaid, That God ſent him to be his Son, and not that God ſent his Son. This ſuppoſes him before he was ſent to have been actually his Son, as certainly he was from before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the World, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23. I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the Beginning or ever the Earth was.</p>
               <p n="37">37 If I do not the works of my Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me not. 38 But if I do, though ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father <hi>is</hi> in me, and I in him.</p>
               <p>Here we have a ſecond Argument, by which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour proves, That it was no Blaſphemy to call himſelf God. But that he was God in very <hi>deed, Namely,</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from his Works. <hi>If I do not the Works of my Father, believe me not:</hi> And the Argument runs thus, If (ſays Chriſt) I do thoſe miraculous Works which no Power leſs than a Divine Power can effect, then you ought by theſe Works to be led to believe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I am truly and really God: But the Works which I do are the Effect and Product of an omnipotent Power, therefore ye ought to believe, That I am one in Eſſence with the Father, there being a mutual Inexiſtence of one Perſon in the other, ſo that the Father is in me, and I in him; and thus I and the Father are one. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt never required of his Diſciples and Followers an Implicite Faith, or a blind Obedience, but as he ſubmitted his Doctrine to the Tryal of Reaſon, ſo he ſubmitted his Miracles to the Examination and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Senſe; therefore he ſays, <hi>If I do not the Works of my Father,</hi> that is, Divine Works, <hi>believe me not</hi> to be a Divine Perſon.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Therefore they ſought again to take him: but he eſcaped out of their hand, 40 And went away again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at firſt baptized; and there he abode. 41 And many reſorted unto him, and ſaid, John did no miracle: but all things that John ſpake of this man, were true. 42 And many believed on him there.</p>

The prudential Care of Chriſt for his own Preſervation; his time being not yet come, he withdraws from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Neſt of his Enemies; and goes beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> when Chriſt was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in one City, he fled to another; he has ſanctified a State of Perſecution to his Miniſters and Members, by his own being in it. 'Tis no Diſgrace for any of them to fly, when their Captain did it, and bids them do it, ſaying, <hi>When they perſecute you in one City, flee unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Obſ.</hi> 3. The Succeſs of Chriſt's Miniſtry beyond <hi>Jordan; Many reſorted to him, and believed on him.</hi> This Place about <hi>Jordan,</hi> was the Place where <hi>John</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed a great Part of his Miniſtry, and now many Years after <hi>John</hi>'s Death, the Fruit of his Miniſtry appears, for <hi>many believed on him there;</hi> that is, about <hi>Jordan</hi> where <hi>John</hi> had preached and baptized. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the Labours of faithful Miniſters may ſeem to be loſt, and lye long like Seed under the Ground, and yet at laſt by ſome new Watering, may ſpring up, and the Fruit appear in abundance. Here <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry about <hi>Jordan</hi> hath freſh Fruit upon Chriſt's coming, long after <hi>John</hi> was dead. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Dignity of Chriſt above <hi>John; John did no Miracle;</hi> but Chriſt did all. The Wiſdom of God ſo ordered it, that though the Old Teſtament Prophets <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> wrought many Miracles for the Confirmation of their Divine Miſſion, yet <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt coming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before Chriſt as his Meſſenger and Forerunner, wrought none, for theſe three Reaſons probably. 1. That ſo the Glory of Chriſt in working Miracles, when he came upon the Stage of his Miniſtry, might be the more clear and evident. 2. That the Evidence of Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſias, might be made the more clear by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought. 3. That the Minds of the People might not be divided and diſtracted between <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt, and that there might be no Pretence of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition between them: <hi>Therefore</hi> John <hi>did no Miracle; but all things that</hi> John <hi>ſpake of Chriſt were true.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 NOw a certain man was ſick, <hi>named</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her ſiſter Martha. 2 (It was <hi>that</hi> Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whoſe brother Lazarus was ſick) 3 Therefore his ſiſters ſent unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord, behold, he whom thou loveſt is ſick. 4 When Jeſus heard <hi>that,</hi> he ſaid, This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>This Chapter relates unto us, the Miraculous Power of Chriſt in raiſing of dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which as it was one of his laſt, ſo was it one of the greateſt Miracles which he wrought; and yet we find none of the Evangeliſts making mention of it, but only St. <hi>John;</hi> the Reaſon ſuppoſed to be this, becauſe when the other Evangeliſts wrote their Hiſtory, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was then alive, (for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays, he lived thirty Years after he was raiſed by Chriſt) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the mention of this Relation might have brought <hi>Lazarus</hi> into Danger and Trouble; but St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Goſpel after <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Death. This Miracle was a ſufficient Demonſtration of Chriſt's Godhead; None but an Almighty Power, could recal a Man four Days dead, from a ſettled Corruption to a State of Life. None but he that created <hi>Lazarus</hi> could thus make him new. <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Tender Sympathy of theſe Two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Siſters with their afflicted Brother, they feel his Sorrows and Acquaint their Saviour with his Sufferings. <hi>Lord! Behold he whom thou loveſt is ſick.</hi> They do not ſay, our Brother that Loves thee is ſick, <hi>but he whom thou loveſt is ſick.</hi> Thereby pleading not the Merit of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but the Mercy of Chriſt. For how can the Love of Chriſt which is infinite and eternal, have any Cauſe but it ſelf. <hi>Note,</hi> the Perſon whom Chriſt loved is ſick and dyes. <hi>Learn</hi> thence, That Strength of Grace and Dearneſs of Reſpect even from Chriſt himſelf cannot prevail either againſt Death or againſt Diſeaſes. <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Chriſt loved is ſick. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The gracious Anſwer which Chriſt ſent to the Siſters Meſſage, <hi>This Sickneſs is not unto Death, but for the Glory of God;</hi> that is, this Sickneſs ſhall not bring upon him ſuch a Death, as he ſhall remain under the Power of, to the General Reſurrection, but is only deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give me an Opportunity of glorifying God, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting my miraculous Power in reſtoring him to Life. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That as God's own Glory is his ſupream Aim and End in all his Actions, ſo in particular it is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him in ſending Afflictions upon his People to glorifie his Power and Wiſdom, Mercy and Love, in and upon them. The Saints Sickneſſes are all for the Glory of God. 2. That God is glorified when his Son is glorified, as none do honour the Father, who do not honour the Son; ſo the Father accounts himſelf glorified when the Glory of his Son is advanced. <hi>This Sickneſs is for the Glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:147"/>5 Now Jeſus loved Martha, and her ſiſter, and Lazarus. 6 When he had heard therefore that he was ſick, he abode two days ſtill in the ſame place where he was. 7. Then after that, ſaith he to <hi>his</hi> diſciples, Let us go into Judea again. 8 <hi>His</hi> diſciples ſay unto him, Maſter, the Jews of late ſought to ſtone thee; and goeſt thou thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? 9 Jeſus anſwered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any Man walk in the day, he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this world. 10 But if a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. What an <hi>happy,</hi> becauſe an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Family was here, and much honoured by Chriſt: <hi>Jeſus loved</hi> Martha, Mary <hi>and</hi> Lazarus; wherever true Piety dwells, it draws the Eye and Heart of Chriſt towards it. Chriſt had frequently and familiarly lodged under their Roof, and he rewards them for their Entertainment, with his Love; <hi>Jeſus loved</hi> Martha <hi>and her Siſter: Where Note,</hi> That <hi>Martha</hi> is here named firſt though elſewhere <hi>Mary</hi> had the Precedency, to ſhew no doubt, that they were both equally dear to Chriſt. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That altho' Chriſt loved <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet he ſeems to neglect him, he delays going to him for ſome days: But could Chriſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf from one ſo long, whom he loved ſo well? we find he did: Let us take heed then that we do not miſ-interpret Chriſt's Delays. He ſeldom comes at our time, but never ſtays beyond his own. Our Saviour had a double End in ſtaying thus long, <hi>Namely,</hi> for greatning of the Miracle, and confirming of their Faith. Had Chriſt gone before <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, they might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed his Recovery rather to the ſtrength of Nature, than to Chriſt's miraculous Power; or had Chriſt raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> as ſoon as he was Dead, they might peradventure have thought it rather ſome Trance or Extaſie, than a Death and Diſſolution; therefore Chriſt ſtays ſo many days, that God might be the more glorified, and his own omnipotent Power the more magnified. <hi>We Learn then,</hi> That when Chriſt delays to help them whom he dearly loves, it is always for wiſe ends and holy purpoſes. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How the Diſciples, tho' they were dearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> (for they had Learned to love where their Maſter loved;) yet they diſcourage Chriſt from going to him into <hi>Judea,</hi> for fear of violence offered to him. <hi>Maſter the Jews of late ſought to ſtone Thee, and goeſt thou thither again?</hi> Here the Diſciples pleaded for their Maſter's ſafety, at the ſame time aiming at their own; they were to go with him into <hi>Judea,</hi> and they well knew that their danger was inwrapped in his. Therefore they ſeek to divert him from his intention. Oh how has the fear of Suffering made many of the Friends of Chriſt decline an opportunity of glorifying God, and doing good to others. But cannot God give ſafety in the midſt of danger, if he pleaſeth? let us not then chuſe our way according to our own Apprehenſions, either of danger or ſafety; but as we ſee God going before us, if our call be clear, let us go on with Courage, whatever difficulties lye in our way. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. How our Saviour corrects theſe fears of his Diſciples, by acquainting them with his <hi>call</hi> from God, to undertake this Journey into <hi>Judea. Are there not Twelve hours in the day? if a Man walk therein he ſtumbleth not; but in the night he ſtumbleth.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, As he that walks in the Day is in no danger of ſtumbling, but in the Night he is in danger. So as long as I have a call from God, and my working time laſts, there is a Divine Providence, that will watch over me and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me from all danger; now my day is not fully ſpent, and therefore it is not in the Power of my Enemies to precipitate my Paſſion, or to bring the Night of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon me before the appointed time; but ere long the Night will come on, the working time will be over, and then ſhall both I and you ſtumble upon Death; but while the day laſteth we are ſafe. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. Every Man has his Twelve hours; that is, his working time aſſigned him by God in this World. 2. While theſe hours are ſpent, and whileſt his working time is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; he ſhall not ſtumble, he ſhall not die, he ſhall not be diſabled for working, while God has any work for him to do; neither the Malice of Men, nor the rage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſhall take them off till their work be finiſhed. 3. Every Man has his Night as well as his Day, in which he muſt expect and prepare to ſtumble; that is, to fall by Death, for when God has done his work by us and with us, he will withdraw his protection from us, but not his care over us, we ſtumble upon Death, and fall into the Grave, but God receives us to himſelf, and at the end of our working Seaſon rewards us for our work.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Theſe things ſaid he: and after that, he ſaith unto them, Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of ſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Our Saviour coming near to <hi>Bethany,</hi> Tells his Diſciples that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſleepeth; that is, plainly he was Dead. This ſhewed his omniſciency, and that he was truly God; for he had received no Advice of his Death from any perſon, but as God he knew that he was deceaſed. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The ſweet Title given both to Death and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Death is called <hi>a ſleep, Lazarus</hi> is ſtiled <hi>a friend;</hi> yet Chriſt ſays not my friend, but our friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſleepeth; intimating that gracious Familiarity and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Friendſhip which was betwixt himſelf and all his Members. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That all True Believers are Chriſt's Friends. 2. That the Friends of Chriſt muſt die as well as others. 3. That their Death is but a Sleep. <hi>Our friend Lazarus Sleepeth.</hi> It followeth, <hi>But I go, that I may awake him out of ſleep. Obſerve,</hi> Chriſt ſays not, we will go and awake him, but I will go and I will awake him. The Diſciples who were Companions in the way, muſt not be Partners in the work; Witneſſes they may be, Actors they cannot be; none can awake <hi>Lazarus</hi> but the maker of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Who can command the Soul to come down, and meet the Body, and who can command the Body to Riſe up and meet the Soul, but that God that created both Soul and Body? Lord! It is our Comfort againſt the Dread and Terror of Death, that our Reſurrection depends upon thy Almighty Power. <hi>I will go, that I may awake him out of ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 Then ſaid his diſciples, Lord, if he ſleep, he ſhall do well. 13 Howbeit Jeſus ſpake of his death: but they thought that he had ſpoken of taking of reſt in ſleep. 14 Then ſaid Jeſus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 15 And I am glad for your ſakes, that I was not there (to the intent ye may believe) never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, let us go unto him. 16 Then ſaid Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow-diſciples, Let us alſo go, that we may die with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How deſirous the Diſciples were that Chriſt ſhould not go to <hi>Bethany</hi> where <hi>Lazarus</hi> was, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany</hi> being within two Miles of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the ſeat of our Saviour's Enemies was. But our Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Call to be clear, Reſolves to go, <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>let us go unto him.</hi> Oh Love ſtronger than Death! the Grave cannot ſeparate betwixt Chriſt and his Friends, other Friends accompany us to the brink of the Grave, and there they leave us to Worms and Duſt, for Death hath both horror and noyſomneſs to attend it. But for thee, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Grave-ſtone, the Earth, the Coffin, are no Bounders of thy Dear Reſpects. Bleſſed be God, that neither Life nor Death can ſeparate from the Love of Chriſt; but even after Death and Burial he is graciouſly affected to thoſe he loves. Chriſt has a Gracious Regard to the Duſt of his Saints; tho' his holy ones ſee Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhall not always lye under the power of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; their dead Bodies are a part of the undoubted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Myſtical Body. Bleſſed be God, the time is coming when Chriſt will knock at the door of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Graves, and call them up out of their Bed of Duſt, <hi>and they ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God and Live. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The Wiſe and Holy deſign of Chriſt in delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go to <hi>Bethany,</hi> till <hi>Lazarus</hi> was Dead; <hi>Namely,</hi> That he might at once Raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Dead Body, and his Diſciples Faith, confirming them in the Belief, that he
<pb facs="tcp:46556:147"/> was the Son of God, and the true Meſſias. But could the Faith of the Apoſtles want confirmation, who had ſeen ſo many Miracles wrought by our Saviour, and had lived under his Miniſtry all the time of it? Yes, the Faith of the moſt Eminent Saints, even of Apoſtles themſelves, wants Confirmation in this ſtate of Weakneſs and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and is capable of Growth. <hi>I am glad for your ſakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may Believe. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. The great Paſſion which <hi>Thomas</hi> expreſſes upon the notice given by Chriſt of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Death: <hi>Plainly Lazarus is Dead,</hi> ſays Chriſt; <hi>Let us go and die with him,</hi> ſays <hi>Thomas.</hi> Oh what paſſionate and impatient Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do ſometimes drop from our Mouths, on the occaſion of the Death of our dear Relations. We are ready to be ſo affected with the Death of our Friends, as to wiſh our ſelves out of the World, that we might be with them. But we muſt remember that it is God that appoints us our ſeveral Poſts, and particular Stations, which we muſt keep, till the Wiſdom of God ſees fit to remove us.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Then when Jeſus came, he found that he had lien in the grave four days already. 18 (Now Bethany was nigh unto Jeruſalem, about fifteen furlongs off) 19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brother. 20 Then Martha, aſſoon as ſhe heard that Jeſus was coming, went and met him: but Mary ſat <hi>ſtill</hi> in the houſe. 21 Then ſaid Martha unto Jeſus, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died. 22 But I know, that even now whatſoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give <hi>it</hi> thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The length of time which Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly delayed before he would come to <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Grave, he was not above ſix Miles off, <hi>Bethany</hi> being within two Miles of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> within four Miles of <hi>Bethabara</hi> where Chriſt now was, and yet our Saviour comes not of four Days; doubtleſs, that the Miracle of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection might be the more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and remarkable. Chriſt could as eaſily have cured <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s being ſick, as have raiſed him being dead; and as eaſily have raiſed him the firſt day as the fourth day; but that had not carried along with it ſuch a full conviction of Chriſt's Almighty Power. Therefore that he might draw the eyes of their Faith more ſteadfaſtly to behold and admire his Almighty Power; our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his coming till <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been dead four Days. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2.

During which time, Neighbours and Friends came to viſit and Relieve them in their ſadneſs with ſuch conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Arguments as they had. Chriſtian Religion doth not condemn natural Affection; humane paſſions are not ſinful, if not exceſſive; to be above the ſtroke of paſſions, is a condition equal to Angels; to be in a ſtate of ſorrow without the Senſe of ſorrow is a diſpoſition beneath the Beaſts; but duly to regulate our ſorrows, and ſet Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries to our grief, is the Wiſdom, the Duty, the Intereſt and the Excellency of a Chriſtian. As to be above all paſſions, will be our happineſs in Heaven, ſo to regulate and rectifie our paſſions, is a great part of our holineſs on Earth. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3.

This alſo farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in her next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>I know that whatſoever thou ſhalt ask of God he will give it thee:</hi> She ſeems not to Believe that Chriſt was able to raiſe him by his own immediate Power, but muſt obtain Power of God to do it, as the Prophets were wont to do, that raiſed the Dead. She thought Chriſt a perſon highly in God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but ſcarce believed him able to raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> by his own Power; had her Faith extended to a Belief that Chriſt was equal with the Father, and that the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in him, ſhe would not have queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his Power to raiſe him from the Grave; for tho' Chriſt as Mediatour did apply himſelf by Prayer to God at the raiſing of Dead <hi>Lazarus; ver.</hi> 41, 42.

                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. Chriſt's meek Anſwer to <hi>Martha</hi>'s paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Diſcourſe, he takes no notice of the forementioned failings, but comforts her with a promiſe of her Brother's Reſurrection, <hi>Thy Brother ſhall riſe again. Thence learn,</hi> That the Knowledge and Belief of the General Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is, and ought to be a ſufficient ſupport under the Loſs of our endeared Friends', who die in the Lord. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That the Doctrine of the General Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was no new Doctrine. <hi>Job</hi> believed it, <hi>ch.</hi> 19.26. <hi>Daniel</hi> publiſh'd it, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.1.

How Chriſt particularly Inſtructs <hi>Martha</hi> in the cauſe of the Reſurrection, acquainting her that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the Author and efficient cauſe of it. <hi>I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the Life.</hi> That is, I am the Author and principal efficient cauſe of the Reſurrection. And this with reſpect to both Natures. 1. His Divine Nature is the efficient cauſe of the Reſurrection, he ſhall Raiſe our Bodies out of the Duſt, by the Power of his Godhead. 2. His Humane Nature is the exemplary cauſe or pattern of the Reſurrection: For which Reaſon Chriſt is called the <hi>firſt Born from the Dead.</hi> For tho' ſome were raiſed before him: Yet was his Reſurrection the cauſe of their Reſurrection. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues from Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the certainty of the Reſurrection of his Members; Chriſt and Believers are one Myſtical Body, therefore is not Chriſt perfectly Riſen, till all his Members are Riſen with him. Indeed Chriſt's perſonal Reſurrection was perfect when he aroſe, and all Believers aroſe Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively in him. Yet till all Believers ariſe perſonally, the Reſurrection of Chriſt has not received its utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but there is ſomewhat behind of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. Moſt fitly then might our Saviour aſſert, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life. Obſerve,</hi> 4. That Chriſt not only aſſerts himſelf to be the Reſurrection, but alſo the Life. I am the Reſurrection <hi>and the Life;</hi> that is, I am the cauſe of Life Natural, Spiritual, and Eternal, and <hi>Whoſoever Liveth and Believeth in Me ſhall never Die.</hi> That is, eternally; tho' his Body ſhall die becauſe of Sin, yet his Spirit ſhall live becauſe of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="27">27 She ſaith unto him, Yea, Lord: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou art the Chriſt the Son of God: which ſhould come into the world. 28 And when ſhe had ſo ſaid, ſhe went her way, and
<pb facs="tcp:46556:148"/> called Mary her ſiſter ſecretly, ſaying, The Maſter is come, and calleth for thee. 29 Aſſoon as ſhe heard <hi>that,</hi> ſhe aroſe quickly, and came unto him. 30 Now Jeſus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 31 The Jews then which were with her in the houſe, and comforted her, when they ſaw Mary that ſhe roſe up haſtily, and went out, followed her, ſaying, She goeth unto the grave, to weep there. 32 Then when Mary was come where Jeſus was, and ſaw him, ſhe fell down at his feet, ſaying unto him, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The full confeſſion which <hi>Martha</hi> makes of her Faith in Chriſt as God; <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Son of God which ſhould come into the World.</hi> A confeſſion which comes neareſt to that of St. <hi>Peter, (Math.</hi> 16.16.) of any that we meet with in Scripture. Nay it ſeems more full than <hi>Peter</hi>'s Confeſſion; for thoſe additional words, <hi>which ſhould come into the World,</hi> are not in his Confeſſion; the Summ is, She believed Chriſt to be the very Meſſias, who was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified and prefigured, Propheſied of, and promiſed to the Old Teſtament Saints, as the perſon that in the fulneſs of time ſhould come into the World for the Redemption and Salvation of it. <hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God which ſhould come into the World. Thence Learn,</hi> That Chriſt is never rightly believed in, nor regularly depended upon for Salvation, except he be owned, and acknowledged to be the Eternal Son of God. <hi>Martha</hi> was now fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of Chriſt's Divine Nature, of which the beſt of the Diſciples till after our Saviour's Reſurrection, had but a faint and uncertain perſwaſion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How earneſt and intent our Saviour was to diſpatch the errand he came upon, <hi>Namely,</hi> to raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, and to comfort the Two mournful Siſters, he would not ſo much as enter the Houſe till he had effected his work; and therefore he goes ſtrait to the Grave, which probably was the place where <hi>Mary</hi> met him: Lord! it was thy Meat and Drink, to do the Will of thy Father; it was thy Meat and Drink by Day, thy Reſt and Repoſe by Night: How unlike are we to thy ſelf, if we ſuffer either our Pleaſures or our Profits to divert us from our Duty. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. What haſte and ſpeed <hi>Mary</hi> makes to attend upon her Saviour; ſhe aroſe quickly and came unto him. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Love added Wings to her motion. The <hi>Jews</hi> obſerving her haſty motion, have a loving ſuſpicion that ſhe is gone to the Grave to weep there; but their Thoughts were too low, for whilſt they ſuppoſed that ſhe went to a dead Brother, ſhe was waiting upon a living Saviour. And ſhe that uſed to ſit at Jeſus feet, now falls at his feet, in an awful veneration; the very geſture was ſupplicatory. And her humble proſtration was ſeconded with a doleful Lamentation; <hi>Lord! If thou hadſt been here my Brother had not died. Where Obſerve,</hi> A mixture of Faith with humane infirmity. Here was ſtrength of Faith in aſcribing ſo much Power to Chriſt, that his preſence could preſerve from Death; but here was Infirmity in ſuppoſing the neceſſity of Chriſt's preſence for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Certainly he that did raiſe him from Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, could have preſerved him from dying, being abſent, had he pleaſed. This was <hi>Mary</hi>'s moan, <hi>Lord! hadſt thou been here, our Brother had not died;</hi> full of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but not from frailty and infirmity. However Chriſt takes no notice of her errors and infirmity; but all the reply we hear of, is a Compaſſionate Groan: which the following Verſes acquaint us with.</p>
               <p n="33">33 When Jeſus therefore ſaw her weeping and the Jews alſo weeping which came with her, he groned in the ſpirit, and was troubled, 34 And ſaid, Where have ye laid him? They ſay unto him, Lord, come and ſee. 35 Jeſus wept. 36 Then ſaid the Jews, Behold how he loved him. 37 And ſome of them ſaid, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have cauſed that even this man ſhould not have died?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Condolency and tender Sympathy expreſſed by our Saviour, upon this occaſion. <hi>He groaned in his Spirit, and was troubled.</hi> Or as the Original has it, he troubled himſelf, intimating that our Saviour's Paſſions were pure and holy, not like ours, muddy and mixt with ſinful imperfection. The Commotions of his Affections were like the ſhaking of pure Water in a Chryſtal-glaſs which ſtill remain clear; and they aroſe and were calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his pleaſure; he was not over-powered by them, but had them at his Command. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That as Chriſt took upon him the Humane Nature, ſo he did aſſume alſo Humane Affections; thereby evidencing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be our Brother and near Kinſman, according to the Fleſh. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the Paſſions and Affections which our Saviour had and expreſt, were always Holy and Innocent; he was not without them, but he was above them: they did never violently and immoderately trouble him, but when he pleaſed he troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Jeſus groaned in Spirit,</hi> and Troubled himſelf. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How our Saviour manifeſts this Condolency and tender Sympathy with <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> by his weeping. <hi>Jeſus wept.</hi> Partly from Compaſſion, and partly for Example; in Compaſſion, firſt to humanity, to ſee how miſerably Sin had debaſed the Humane Nature, and rendred Man like unto the Bruit Beaſts that periſh. <hi>2dly,</hi> In Compaſſion to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he was now about to bring back into a ſinful and troubleſome World. Thus St. <hi>Jerom, Non flevit Chriſtus Lachrymas noſtras, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt (ſays he) did not weep our Tears, he mourned over <hi>Lazarus</hi> not becauſe dead, but becauſe now to be brought again to Life. Again, Chriſt wept for our Example, to fetch Sighs and Tears from us, at the ſight of others miſeries, and eſpecially at the Funerals of our godly Friends. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That mourning and ſorrow, and this expreſt by Tears and weeping, is an Affection proper for thoſe that go to Funerals; provided it be decently kept within due bounds, and is not exceſſive. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſorrow is hurtful to the living, and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the dead, neither is it an Argument of more Love, but an Evidence of leſs Grace. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. How the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerving Chriſt's ſorrow for, admire his Love to, Dead <hi>Lazarus. Behold! how he loved him.</hi> Chriſt's Love to his People is admirable and Soul amazing, ſuch as ſee it, may admire it, but can never fully comprehend it. <hi>Note,</hi> 4. How ſome of the malicious <hi>Jews</hi> attempt to leſſen the Reputation of our Saviour, not willing to own him to be God, becauſe he did not keep <hi>Lazarus</hi> from dying; as if Chriſt could not be the Son of God, becauſe he did not at all times, and in all caſes exert and put forth his Divine Power. Whereas Chriſt acted freely and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, governing his Actions by his own Wiſdom, as he ſaw moſt conducing to the ends and purpoſes of his own Glory.</p>
               <p n="38">38 Jeſus therefore again groning in himſelf, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a ſtone lay upon it. 39 Jeſus ſaid, Take ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtone. Martha, the ſiſter of him that was dead, ſaith unto him, Lord, by this time he ſtinketh: for he hath been <hi>dead</hi> four days. 40 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God? 41 Then they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtone <hi>from the place</hi> where the dead was laid. And Jeſus lift up <hi>his</hi> eyes, and ſaid, Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me. 42 And I knew that thou heareſt me always: but becauſe of the people which ſtand by, I ſaid <hi>it,</hi> that they may believe that thou haſt ſent me. 43 And when he thus had ſpoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jeſus ſaith unto them, Looſe him, and let him go.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:148"/>
               <p>In theſe Verſes we find our Lord addreſſing himſelf to the Miracle of raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave. Firſt he commands them to take away the Stone. But could not that Voice which raiſed the Dead, remove the Stone? Yes, no doubt; but it is always the Will of Chriſt that we put forth our utmoſt Endeavours and do what we can, in order to our own Deliverance. To remove the Stone and unty the Napkins was in their Power; This therefore they muſt do, but to raiſe the Dead was out of their Power; this therefore Chriſt will do alone. Our Hands muſt do their utmoſt, before Chriſt will put forth his Help. The Stone being thus removed, his Eyes begin; they are lift up to Heaven, His Father's Throne, from whence he expects to derive his Power. His Tongue Seconds his Eye, and he prays unto his Father. Chriſt as God wrought this Miracle by his own Power. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as Mediatour, and ſo he looks up to his Father by Prayer, yet we hear of no Prayer, but a Thankſgiving only. Chriſt's Will was his Prayer; whatever Chriſt willed, God granted. Chriſt and his Father having one Eſſence, one Nature, and one Will. Neither was it fit for Chriſt to pray vocally and audibly, leſt the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews ſhould ſay, he did all by entreaty, nothing by Power. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> That as Chriſt when he ſpake to his Father, lifted up his Eyes, ſo when he ſpake to dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> he lifted up his Voice, and cryed aloud. This Chriſt did, that the Strength of the Voice might anſwer the Strength of the Affection: Since we vehemently utter what we earneſtly deſire; alſo that the greatneſs of the Voice might anſwer to the greatneſs of the Work, but eſpecially that the Hearers might be Witneſſes that this mighty Work was performed, not by any magical Inchantments, which are commonly mumbled forth with a low Voice, but by an authoritative and divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. In a word, might not Chriſt utter a loud Voice at the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that it might be a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhrill and loud Voice of the laſt Trumpet at the General Reſurrection, which ſhall ſound into all Graves, and raiſe all Fleſh from their Bed of Duſt? <hi>Obſ. next,</hi> As the manner of our Lord's ſpeaking with a loud Voice, ſo the Words ſpoken by him: <hi>Lazarus, Come forth. Mark,</hi> Chriſt ſays not, <hi>Lazarus</hi> revive, but as if he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him already alive, he ſays, <hi>Lazarus, Come forth;</hi> to let us know that they are alive to him, who are dead to us. <hi>Mark alſo,</hi> what a commanding Word this was, <hi>Come forth:</hi> not that it was in the power of theſe loud commanding Words to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but in the quickning power of Chriſt which attended theſe words. Oh Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour! It is thy Voice which we ſhall ere long hear ſounding into the Bottom of the Grave and raiſing us up from our Bed of Duſt. It is thy Voice that ſhall pierce the Rocks, divide the Mountains, and eccho forth throughout the Univerſe, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to Judgment. Obſerve laſtly,</hi> How readily obedient <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to the Call and Command of Chriſt; <hi>He that was dead came forth;</hi> and if <hi>Lazarus</hi> did thus inſtantly ſtart up at the Voice of Chriſt in the Day of his Humiliation, how ſhall the dead be rouzed up out of their Graves by that Voice which will ſhake the powers of Heaven and move the Foundations of the Earth, in the Day of his Glorification! <hi>Queſtion,</hi> But where was <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Soul all this while, that he was dead? if in Heaven, was it not a wrong to him to come from thence? If not, doth it not prove that the Soul ſleeps as well as the Body? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Souls go not to Heaven by Neceſſitation, as the Fire naturally and neceſſarily aſcends upward. But are diſpoſed of by God as the ſupream Governour, thoſe that have ſerved him, go to Heaven, and thoſe that have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Devil, to Hell, and thoſe that are not yet judged to either place, but are to live preſently again upon Earth, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was, are reſerved by God accordingly: whether ſhut up in the Body as in a Swound, or whether kept in the Cuſtody and Hands of an Angel not far from the Body, waiting his pleaſure, either to reſtore it to the Body, or to return it to its proper place of Bliſs or Miſery. The Scripture has not told us whether, and it would be too great Curioſity to inquire, and greater preſumption to determine.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had ſeen the things which Jeſus did, believed on him. 46 But ſome of them went their ways to the Phariſees, and told them what things Jeſus had done. 47 ¶ Then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the chief prieſts and the Phariſees a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſaid, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The different Effects which this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had upon thoſe Jews who were preſent at the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Some of them believed on Chriſt, but others perſiſting in their Unbelief, went to the Phariſees and informed againſt him. Notwithſtanding all the Evidence which our Saviour gave of his being the Meſſias by the Miracles which he wrought; yet many rejected him and refuſed to believe in him, to their unutterable and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Condemnation. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. How greatly diſturbed the Phariſees were upon the Account of our Saviour's Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Knowing how proper an Argument they were to convince Men, they concluded that if Chriſt were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go on and work Miracles, he would draw all Men after him. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Jeſus proved himſelf to be the true Meſſias by the Miracles which he wrought, his Enemies themſelves being Judges. For we find here, the worſt of our Saviour's Enemies were afraid of his Miracles, that by them he would draw all Men after him. <hi>If we let him alone all Men will believe on him. Obſ.</hi> 3. What was the Ground of the Phariſees fear, if they let Chriſt go on to work Miracles, that he would have ſo many Followers as would Alarm the Romans and awaken their Jealouſie and cauſe them to come upon them with an Army to deprive them of the little Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they indulged them, and take away their Place and Nation: <hi>Their Place;</hi> that is, their Place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Temple: <hi>And their Nation;</hi> that is, bring the whole Body of the Jewiſh Nation to utter Deſtruction. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> How all the Enemies and Oppoſers of Chriſt and his Kingdom do endeavour to colour their Quarrel with ſome ſpecious Pretences, that they may hide the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of their Practices from the Eye of the World, and may not be openly ſeen to fight againſt God. Thus the Phariſees here perſecute our Saviour, not as the Meſſias, (though the Miracles he wrought were a ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he was ſuch) but as one who would bring Ruine upon their Nation. <hi>If we let him alone, the Romans will come and take away both our Place and Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="49">49 And one of them <hi>named</hi> Caiaphas, being the high-prieſt that ſame year, ſaid unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 50 Nor conſider that it is expedient for us, that one man ſhould die for the people, and that the whole nation periſh not. 51 And this ſpake he not of himſelf: but being high-prieſt that year, he propheſied that Jeſus ſhould die for that nation. 52 And not for that nation only, but that alſo he ſhould gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, the children of God that were ſcattered abroad.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Verſes acquainted us with the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion which the chief Prieſts had of the Neceſſity of taking away the Life of our bleſſed Saviour; <hi>Leſt the Romans ſhould take away both their Place and Nation.</hi> Now here in theſe Verſes <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High-Prieſt delivers his Opinion for the preventing of this danger, he tells the reſt that they ought not to boggle at the Matter, but come to a poſitive and peremptory Reſolution to provide for the Publick Safety, Right or Wrong; and that it is great Folly to prefer one Man's Life, though never ſo innocent before a Nations Welfare; a moſt wicked and deviliſh Speech; as a Judge he regarded not what was lawful, but as a wicked Politician he conſulted what was expedient; he declares that one Man, though never ſo good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though never ſo juſt and innocent, had better dye,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:149"/> than a whole Nation ſuffer: Whereas it is in any caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to do Evil that Good may come. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That although it be the Duty of all Perſons to pray for, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after the publick Welfare of a Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof they are Members, yet it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to promote the greateſt National Good, by wicked and unlawful Means. <hi>Obſerve further,</hi> How God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled the Tongue of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> beyond his own intention, prophetically to foretel that great good which by our Saviour's death ſhould redound to the World. And that the Fruit and Benefit of his death ſhould not only extend to the Jews, but to the Gentiles alſo; and that he ſhould gather into one Body or Church, all that truly believe in him; though far and wide diſperſed upon the Face of the Earth. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy did ſometimes fall upon very bad Men; and God has been pleaſed to reveal ſome part of his Mind to the worſt of Men. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> had in their Dreams a Revelation from God what things he intended to do. <hi>Learn</hi> 2. That it is conſiſtent with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God ſometimes to make uſe of the Tongues of the worſt of Men to publiſh and declare his Will. <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> here though a vile and wicked Man was influenced by God to propheſie and ſpeak an Oracle. Almighty God may, when he pleaſe, employ wicked Men this way, without any prejudice to his Holineſs. <hi>This Caiaphas ſpake not of himſelf, but being High-Prieſt, he propheſied that Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How baneful and deſtructive Evil Counſel is, eſpecially out of the Mouth of leading Men, and how ſoon embraced and followed. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> no ſooner propounds the putting of Chriſt to Death, but from that Day forward they lie in wait to take him.

               <p>THen Jeſus, ſix days before the paſſover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p>The latter end of the foregoing Chapter acquainted us with the prudential Care of Chriſt in withdrawing from the Fury of his Enemies in and about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were conſulting his Deſtruction: his time not being fully come, he gets out of the way of his Perſecutors. But now the Paſſover being at hand, which was the time that this Lamb of God was to die as a Sacrifice for the Sin of the World; Our Lord comes forth firſt to <hi>Bethany</hi> and then to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not fearing the Teeth of his Enemies, but with a fixed Reſolution to encounter Death and Danger for the Salvation of his People. <hi>His Example teacheth us.</hi> That altho' we are bound by all lawful Means and prudential Methods to preſerve our ſelves from the unjuſt Violence of our Perſecutors, yet when God's time for our Sufferings is come, and we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſee that it is his Will that we ſuffer for his ſake, we ought to ſet our Faces very chearfully towards it, and reſign up our ſelves to the Wiſdom and Will of God. Thus did Chriſt here, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.54. we find he withdrew from Suffering, his Hour not being then come; but now when the Paſſover was nigh at hand, which was the time when he was to ſuffer, he ſets his Face towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and withdraws no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There they made him a ſupper, and Martha ſerved: but Lazarus was one of them that ſat at the table with him. 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment, of ſpikenard, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coſtly, and anointed the feet of Jeſus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the houſe was filled with the odour of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4 Then ſaith one of his diſciples, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Iſcariot, Simons <hi>ſon,</hi> which ſhould betray him, 5 Why was not this ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 6 This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor, but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 7 Then ſaid Jeſus, Let her alone: againſt the day of my burying hath ſhe kept this. 8 For the poor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes, an account is given of our Saviour's entertainment at <hi>Bethany,</hi> after he had raiſed <hi>Lazarus.</hi> A Supper is made for him; at which <hi>Martha</hi> ſerved, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſate with him; but <hi>Mary</hi> Anoints Chriſt with precious Ointments. <hi>Where Note,</hi> 1. The Action which this Holy Woman performed, ſhe pours a Box of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ointment upon our Saviour's Head, as he ſat at Meat, according to the cuſtom of the Eaſtern Countries at their Feaſts. I do not find that any of the Apoſtles were at thus much charge and coſt, to put honour upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as this poor Woman was. <hi>From whence learn,</hi> 1. That where ſtrong Love prevails in the Heart, nothing is adjudg'd too dear for Chriſt; neither will it ſuffer it ſelf to be out-ſhined by any Examples. The weakeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſtrongly Loves her Saviour, will vye with the greateſt Apoſtle, and Piouſly ſtrive to expreſs the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of her Affection towards him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How this Action was reſented and reflected upon by murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Judas,</hi> who valued this Ointment at Three hundred Pence, and grudg'd the beſtowing of it upon Chriſt. He accuſes this Holy Woman of needleſs prodigality. Lord! How doth a Covetous heart think every thing too good for Thee. He that ſees a Pious Action performed, and ſeeks to leſſen or undervalue it, ſhews himſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a Spirit of Envy. <hi>Judas</hi> his invidious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit makes him cenſure an Action which Chriſt highly approved. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That Men who know not our Hearts, may thro' ignorance or prejudice cenſure and condemn thoſe Actions which God doth commend and will graciouſly reward. Happy was it for this poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſhe had a more Righteous Judg to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon her Action than wicked <hi>Judas. Obſerve,</hi> 3. How readily our Holy Lord vindicates this poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:149"/> ſhe ſays nothing for her ſelf, nor need ſhe, having ſuch an Advocate, and gives the Reaſon for her Action, <hi>She did it for my Burial,</hi> as Kings and great Perſons were wont in thoſe Eaſtern Countries, at their Funerals to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm'd with Odours and ſweet Perfumes. So ſaith our Saviour, this Woman to declare her Faith in me, as her King and Lord, doth with this Box of Ointment as it were before-hand Embalm my Body for its Burial. True Faith will put honour upon a Crucified, as well as Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saviour.

                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> It was not zeal but curioſity which brought theſe perſons at this time to Chriſt; they had an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire to ſee <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to enquire after the Truth of his Death; and poſſibly after the ſtate of the Dead, and the condition that ſeparated Souls are in, after Death. Thus the Miracles of Chriſt drew many followers after his Perſon, who were never converted by his Doctrine. It was the Sin of many, when Chriſt was here upon Earth, that they flock'd after him; rather out of Curioſity than out of Conſcience, and choſe rather to gaze upon his Works, than to fall in Love with the Worker. The Multitude here came to <hi>Bethany, Not for Jeſus's ſake onely, but that they might ſee Lazarus alſo.</hi>

How he Arms his Diſciples againſt the ſcandal of the Croſs, by ſhewing them the great Benefit that would redound by his Death unto all Mankind; and this by a Similitude taken from Grain, <hi>Except a Corn of Wheat fall into the Ground and die, it abideth alone.</hi> That is, as Corn unſown, lodg'd in the Barn, or laid up in the Chamber, never multiplies nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes; but ſow it in the Field, and bury it in the Earth, and it multiplies and encreaſes, and brings forth a plentiful crop. So if Chriſt had not died, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained what he was, the Eternal Son of God; but he had had no Church in the World. Whereas his Death and Sufferings made him fructifie. That brought a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Encreaſe of exaltation to himſelf, and Salvation to his People. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How plainly our Saviour dealt with his Followers; he did not deceive them with a vain hope and expectation of Temporal Happineſs, but tells them plainly that all that will be his Diſciples muſt prepare for Sufferings, and not think their Temporal Life too dear to lay down for him, when he calls them to it, this being the ſureſt way to ſecure unto themſelves Life Everlaſting. <hi>He that loveth his life ſhall loſe it, but he that hateth his life in this world ſhall keep it unto life eternal.

If there was ſuch Dread and Terrors, ſuch Thunderings and Lightnings at the giving of the Law; Lord!

The end why God the Father now ſpake with an Audible Voice to Chriſt his Son; it was for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and the Peoples Confirmation. His Soul being troubled, he ſtood in need as Mediatour, of comfort from his Father; and the People had here a farther and fuller Confirmation of his being the promiſed and true Meſſias; that ſo they might Believe in him. <hi>This voice came not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of me;</hi> That is, not only or chiefly becauſe of me, but to confirm your Faith in the Belief of this great Truth, that I am the Son of God, by whom the Father hath glorified, and will farther glorifie his Name. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. Our Saviour declares a double effect and fruit of his Death and Paſſion. 1. The judgment of this World. <hi>Now is the judgment of this World, now ſhall the Prince of this World be caſt out.</hi> That is, my Death will be the Devil's overthrow; will bring down Sin, and deliver the World from the Tyranny and Dominion of Sin and Satan. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Satan is the Prince and Ruler of all thoſe who live in Sin; not a Prince by Legal Right, but by Tyrannical Uſurpation. 2. That this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper Satan will not quit his Poſſeſſion, unleſs he be caſt out. 3. That Chriſt by his Death has caſt out Satan, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned him, and deprived him of his Tyrannical Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Now is the Prince of this World caſt out.</hi> That is, I will ſhortly by my Death deliver the World from the ſlavery of Sin, and Dominion of Satan; and particularly
<pb facs="tcp:46556:150"/> from that Idolatry which the greateſt part of the World were then in ſlavery under. The ſecond effect and fruit of Chriſt's Death which is here declared, is his drawing all Men unto him. <hi>When I am lifted up from the Earth, I will draw all Men unto me.</hi> There is a twofold lifting up of Chriſt; the firſt Ignominious, when he was hung upon the Croſs; the ſecond Glorious in the Preaching of the Goſpel, by this he draws all Men unto him; that is, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, he calls and invites all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to himſelf; he offers the Benefits of his Death to all, and gathered a Church to himſelf out of the Gentile, as well as the Jewiſh World. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That all perſons are naturally unwilling to come to Chriſt; they muſt be drawn. 2. That Chriſt meritoriouſly by his Death, and inſtrumentally by the Preaching of the Goſpel, draws Sinners unto himſelf. 3. That it is not a few, or ſmall number, but a very great number, conſiſting both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Bond and Free, perſons of all Nations, Sexes, Ages, and Conditions, whom Chriſt draweth: Not that all are effectually drawn to Chriſt, ſo as ſavingly to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; but by the Preaching of the Goſpel, they are called and invited to him; and the Benefits of his Death are offered to them. Thus Chriſt being lifted up, upon his Croſs, and on the Pole of his Goſpel, draws all Men unto him.</p>
               <p n="34">34 The people anſwered him, We have heard out of the law, that Chriſt abideth for ever: and how ſayeſt thou, The Son of Man muſt be lift up? who is this Son of Man? 35 Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you: walk while ye have the light, leſt darkneſs come upon you: for he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth. 36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.

That tho' many of the chief Rulers had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Belief, or an inward Perſwaſion that Chriſt was the promiſed and expected Meſſias; yet it was not ſufficient to make them openly own, confeſs and avow him to be ſuch; for fear of Excommunication from the <hi>Phariſees. They did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue.</hi> Slaviſh fear of Men, and ſuffering by them, has hindred many from believing on Chriſt, and kept more from an open owning and confeſſing of him. <hi>Becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſs him. Obſerve,</hi> 3. As the fear of Suffering on the one hand, ſo the Love of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the other, kept them from owning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Jeſus to be the Chriſt. <hi>They loved the praiſe of Men more than the praiſe of God.</hi> That is, They valued Honour and Applauſe from Men, more than God's honouring and approving them. There is no greater ſnare to draw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from their Duty, than inordinate Love and Affection to their own Credit and Reputation. Oh how often is the Applauſe and Commendation of Men preferred before the Teſtimony and Approbation of God! Here was their ſnare, <hi>They loved the praiſe of Men more than the praiſe of God.</hi>

               <p n="44">44 ¶ Jeſus cried, and ſaid, he that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me. 45 And he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me. 46 I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever believeth on me ſhould not abide in darkneſs. 47 And if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world. 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him: the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day. 49 For I have not ſpoken of my ſelf; but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a commandment, what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak. 50 And I know that his commandment is life everlaſting: whatſoever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</p>
               <p>In theſe Verſes, we have our bleſſed Saviour's farewel Sermon to the <hi>Jews,</hi> concerning his Perſon, Office, and Doctrine; as touching his Perſon, he acquaints them with his Divine Nature, his oneneſs and equality with the Father; and accordingly challenges not only the Aſſent, but alſo the Obedience and Adoration of their Faith. <hi>Jeſus cried, ſaying, he that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> That is, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, doth not believe on a meer Man; but on him that is truly and really God, as well as Man, and therefore he being true God, one in Eſſence, and equal in Power and Glory with the Father; their believing in him, was believing in God the Father that ſent him. <hi>Obſerve.</hi> 2. The Argument which our Saviour uſes to prove that Believers in Chriſt do Believe in the Father. <hi>He that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me.</hi> That is, He that ſeeth me Spiritually, and by Faith; ſeeth my Father to be one with me in Eſſence, tho' not in perſon; and he that ſeeth me in my Miraculous works which I do, ſeeth him alſo that ſent me, by whom I do theſe mighty works. <hi>Learn hance,</hi> 1. That we do not ſee Chriſt aright by the Eye of our Faith, unleſs we ſee him and Believe him to be truly and really God; one with, and equal to the Father, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth in me him that ſent me. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the Father is not to be ſeen but in the Son, nor can Believers know what the Father is, but by ſeeing what the Son is, and what they ſee the Son to be, that the Father is in him. <hi>For he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me. Obſerve,</hi> 3. The dreadful judgment which Chriſt denounces againſt all Unbelievers, and ſuch as reject him, by rejecting of his Goſpel; for tho' at Chriſt's firſt coming, his errand was not to judge the World; but to ſave the World, that is, to offer the tenders of Salvation to loſt Sinners: yet at his ſecond coming he would judge them at the laſt Day; when the Word preached to them, and rejected by them, will give a judicial Teſtimony againſt them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Chriſt and his Doctrine are inſeparable; to receive his Doctrine, is to receive him, and to reject his Doctrine, is to reject him. 2. That ſuch rejecters of Chriſt and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſhall not eſcape the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt at the great Day. 3. That at the great Day, were there no other witneſs againſt the rejecters of Chriſt and his Goſpel, but the Word preached; yet that alone will be ſufficient both for their Conviction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day. Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Argument and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which our Saviour produces, to prove that the Word of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel ſlighted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſhould condemn Sinners, at the great Day. <hi>Namely,</hi> From the Divine Authority of his Doctrine; for albeit, his Doctrine was his own, as he was true God, yet as Man, and as Mediatour it was not his own, but the Father's which ſent him; ſo that his Word and Doctrine being Divine, and the Father's as well as his, (<hi>for he did not ſpeak of himſelf;</hi> that is, of himſelf alone; and without the Father,) it is ſufficient to Judge and Condemn all the rejecters and deſpiſers of it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That tho' the Doctrine of the Goſpel be Chriſt's own, as he is truly and really God; yet it was not his own as meer Man, excluſive of the Father, who is one God with him; and who gave him a Commiſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as Mediatour, to Preach and Publiſh the glad tidings of the Goſpel; for ſays he, <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, but the Father which ſent me gave me a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 2. That the Doctrine which Chriſt delivered by command from the Father, doth point out the way to Eternal Life, and will bring loſt Sinners thereunto, if they ſincerely believe it and obey it. <hi>I know that his Commandment is Life everlaſting.</hi> 3. That therefore Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who reject the Doctrine of Chriſt contained in the Goſpel, do highly Diſhonour, Offend, and Affront, both the Father and Son, and bring upon themſelves a juſt and righteous judgment; and expoſe themſelves to unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and inevitable condemnation. <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt Day.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 NOW before the feaſt of the paſſover, when Jeſus knew that his hour was come, that he ſhould depart out of this world, unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 2 And ſupper being ended, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iſcariot, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>ſon</hi> to betray him) 3 Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God,</p>
               <p>In this Chapter is Recorded the Hiſtory of our Saviour's waſhing his Diſciples Feet, an Action full of Humility and Condeſcenſion, and propounded to his followers Imitation. The Circumſtance of Time is here noted, when this Act was done; <hi>Namely,</hi> At the Feaſt of the Paſſover, when the time of our Saviour's departure was at hand; and having conſtantly and immutably loved his own, he expreſſes the permanency of his Love towards them to the end, by this Action of his, in waſhing their Feet. <hi>Here Note,</hi> How Chriſt choſe the Time of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover to ſuffer in, that he might prove himſelf to be the ſubſtance of that Type; that he was the true Paſcal Lamb, who by the Sacrifice of his Death did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone Divine diſpleaſure, and taketh away the Sins of the World. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The means which the Wiſdom of God permitted, to bring the Lord of Life to his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Death. And that was the Treaſon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs
<pb facs="tcp:46556:151"/> of one of his own Diſciples, <hi>Judas Iſcariot. Where Obſerve,</hi> 1. The perſon betraying <hi>Judas; Judas</hi> a Profeſſor, <hi>Judas</hi> a Preacher, <hi>Judas</hi> an Apoſtle, being one of the Twelve; whom Chriſt had choſen out of all the World to be his deareſt Friend. Can we wonder to find Friends unfriendly, or unfaithful towards us, when our Saviour had a Traytor in his own Houſe? <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of <hi>Judas</hi> Sin, in betraying Chriſt, <hi>he betrayed Chriſt</hi> Jeſus a Man, Chriſt Jeſus his Maſter, Chriſt. Jeſus his Maker; the firſt was Murther, the ſecond Treaſon. Lord! It is no ſtrange or uncommon thing, for the vileſt of Sins, and moſt horrid impieties to be acted by perſons making the moſt eminent profeſſion of thy holy Religion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. What hand the Devil had in the Sufferings of our Saviour: He put it into <hi>Judas</hi>'s heart to betray Chriſt; that is, he did ſuggeſt and inject ſuch thoughts into his mind, which <hi>Judas</hi> inſtantly cloſed with. The Devil being a Spirit, has a quick acceſs to our Spirits, and can inſtill his ſuggeſtions into them, as Chriſt did breath upon his Diſciples, and they received the Holy Ghoſt, and were filled with the Spirit; ſo Satan breaths fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſuggeſtions into the Spirits of Men, and fills them with all manner of wickedneſs, even with the Spirit of Hell it ſelf. <hi>The Devil put it into Judas heart to betray him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 He riſeth from ſupper, and laid aſide his garments, and took a towel and girded himſelf. 5 After that, he poureth water into a baſon, and began to waſh the diſciples feet, and to wipe <hi>them</hi> with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> The admirable humility, and great ſelf-denial of our Lord and Maſter; he ariſes from Supper, whilſt his Diſciples ſate ſtill, and he that came in the form of a Servant, performs all the offices of the meaneſt Servant to his Diſciples; he lays aſide his upper Garments, he girds himſelf with a Towel, pours Water into a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and begins to waſh and wipe their Feet, which lay out behind them, as they leaned at the Table; all which was a moſt ſervile imployment. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the wonderful humility of Jeſus Chriſt inclined him to do the meaneſt offices of Service unto his People, even to become a Servant to them, in the Day of his Humiliation; and tho' now glorified in Heaven, he retains the ſame Compaſſionate Heart towards them, as when here on Earth.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter ſaith unto him, Lord, doſt thou waſh my feet? 7 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, What I do thou knoweſt not now; but thou ſhalt know hereafter. 8 Peter ſaith unto him, Thou ſhalt never waſh my feet. Jeſus anſwered him, If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me. 9 Simon Peter ſaith unto him, Lord, not my feet onely, but alſo <hi>my</hi> hands and <hi>my</hi> head. 10 Jeſus ſaith to him, He that is waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, needeth not, ſave to waſh <hi>his</hi> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 11 For he knew who ſhould betray him; therefore ſaid he, ye are not all clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How <hi>Simon Peter</hi> refuſes to admit of ſuch a condeſcending act from Chriſt his Lord and Maſter, as the waſhing of his Feet. Lord! Thou ſhalt never waſh my Feet; it is a ſinful humility to refuſe the offered favours of Chriſt, becauſe we are unworthy to receive them. Tho' we are not worthy of Chriſt, and of his Love; yet Chriſt is worthy of us, and of our Faith. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Saviour's Reply to <hi>Peter</hi>'s refuſal. 1. He tells him that there was more in it than the bare act of waſhing did at firſt ſight import, and that he ſhould know hereafter what he did not underſtand now. <hi>What I do, thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Servants of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are oftimes much to ſeek and cannot apprehend and underſtand at preſent, the actings and dealings of God with them; they underſtand not either the intent, or the event of God's diſpenſations. 2. That altho' God's dealings with his Children and People are for a while in the dark, and are not preſently made known; yet there will come a time for the clearing and evidencing of them, when they ſhall underſtand that all his diſpenſations were in mercy to them. The ſecond part of our Saviour's Reply to St. <hi>Peter</hi> follows, <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Peter,</hi> This external act of mine in waſhing thy Feet, doth ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther, and imports my waſhing of thy Soul from the guilt and defilement of Sin, without which thou canſt neither have intereſt in me, nor Communion with me. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That ſo univerſal is the pollution of Sin, that every Soul ſtands in need of waſhing. 2. That Chriſt waſheth all that have a part and intereſt in him, both from the guilt and pollution of all their Sin. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. That St. <hi>Peter</hi> now underſtanding better what was meant by this outward waſhing, <hi>Namely,</hi> That it did ſignifie and repreſent the cleanſing of the Soul from the defilement of Sin, he is ſo far from refuſing that Chriſt ſhould waſh his Feet, that he offers, Hands, and Head, and all to be waſhed by him. <hi>Lord not my Feet only,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſo thoroughly ſenſible are the Saints of the filthineſs and pollution of Sin; that they deſire nothing more than an inward, thorough, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing purification of their whole Man, by the Blood and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. Our Saviour's Reply to St. <hi>Peters</hi>'s laſt Requeſt, <hi>he that is waſhed, needeth not, ſave to waſh his Feet;</hi> plainly alluding to the cuſtom of thoſe Countries, where going abroad barefoot, or with thin Sandals, covering only a ſmall part of their Feet, they had frequent occaſion to waſh their Feet, but no need to waſh their whole Bodies. In like manner, the Saints and Servants of God, who are already waſhed and cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt from the guilt of their Sins, and have a real work of Renovation and Sanctification begun in them by the Spirit of Chriſt, they ought to be daily purging and purifying their Affections and Actions, and labouring daily after further meaſures and degrees of Sanctification. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the holieſt, the wiſeſt, and the beſt of Saints; whileſt here in a World of Sin and Temptation, do ſtand in need of a daily waſhing by Repentance; and according to their renewed and repeated acts of Sin. 2. That all juſtified perſons are in God's account clean perſons; <hi>ye are clean, but not all;</hi> that is, you are juſtified and pardoned, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and cleanſed, all of you excepting <hi>Judas,</hi> whoſe heart was known to Chriſt, tho' his Hypocriſie was hid from the Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="12">12 So after he had waſhed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was ſet down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſaid unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 13 Ye call me Maſter, and Lord: and ye ſay well; for <hi>ſo</hi> I am. 14 If I then <hi>your</hi> Lord and Maſter, have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet. 15 For I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you. 16 Verily verily I ſay unto you, The ſervant is not greater then his lord, neither he that is ſent, greater then he that ſent him.</p>
               <p>In theſe words, our Saviour declares to his Diſciples his intention and deſign in waſhing of their Feet; <hi>Namely,</hi> To teach them by his Example, the duty of humility; that as he had performed that act of abaſement towards them, ſo ſhould they be ready to perform all offices of Love, and humble Condeſcenſion one towards another. <hi>Behold, I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do as I have done unto you. Learn thence,</hi> That humility and mutual condeſcenſion amongſt the Members and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, is a moſt neceſſary Grace and Duty, which the Son of God not only taught by his Doctrine, but recommended and inforced by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The Argument which Chriſt makes uſe of to preſs the imitation of his Example upon them; and that is drawn from the titles given to him by his Diſciples. <hi>Ye call me Maſter, and Lord, and ſo I am.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:152"/> Now Servants ought to imitate their Maſter, and Subjects to obey their Lord and King. Chriſt is a Maſter to teach and direct; a Lord to govern and protect; as he is a Maſter, we are to learn in his School; as he is a Lord we are to ſerve in his Houſe; he muſt be ſubmitted to as a Prince, as well as relied upon as a Saviour. It is in vain to expect Salvation from him, if we do not yield ſubjection to him: Another Argument which our Lord makes uſe of to preſs his Diſciples to imitate his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is drawn from his Dignity and Superiority over them: <hi>The Servant is not greater than his Lord;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, Tho' you my Diſciples are to have a very high and honourable ſtation, in the Goſpel Church; yet let not this ſwell you with pride; but be you mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to each other. Remembring you are yet but Servants to my ſelf, and ought to be ſo to one another; <hi>and the Servant is not greater than his Lord. Learn hence,</hi> That whatever dignity Chriſt confers upon his Servants and Officers, yet he is over them all, ſuperior to them and above them. 2. That the conſideration of Chriſt's Dignity, and his Miniſters meanneſs, ought to keep their minds humble and lowly, and far from affecting Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over their Brethren. <hi>The Servant is not greater than his Lord; nor he that is ſent greater than he that ſent him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17 If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>
               <p>Our Lord here intimates unto to us theſe two things. 1. The neceſſity of Knowledge, in order unto Practice. 2. The neceſſity of Practice, in order unto Happineſs. A Man may know the Will of God indeed and not do it; but he can never do the Will of God (acceptably) and not know it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Chriſt doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of a blind Obedience in his People; but requires that their Practice and Obedience be founded upon Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Knowledge. 2. That the firſt care of thoſe that will be Chriſt's Diſciples and followers, muſt be this: With all ſeriouſneſs to apply themſelves to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Maſter's Will. 3. That next to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Duty, our firſt and chief care muſt be to practiſe every thing that we underſtand, and know to be our Duty. 4. That a right-knowledge and practice of our Duty, will certainly make us happy. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 ¶ I ſpeak not of you all; I know whom I have choſen: but that the ſcripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel againſt me.</p>
               <p>If the chuſing ſpoken of here be underſtood of Eternal Election, a chuſing to everlaſting Life; then it affords a ſtrong Argument to prove Chriſt to be God. Thus, he that is the Author of Eternal Election, is God, but Chriſt is ſuch, <hi>I know whom I have choſen.</hi> Conſider Chriſt as God, ſo we are choſen by him, conſider him as Mediatour, and ſo we are choſen in him. If the chuſing here, be meant of chuſing to the work of the Apoſtleſhip; then our Saviour tells his Diſciples, that it need not ſeem ſtrange to them, that he choſe one to be an Apoſtle, whom he knew would prove a Traitour; for hereby that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Propheſie, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.9. would be fulfilled, <hi>He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Bread with me, hath lift up the heel againſt me;</hi> which tho' it was literally ſpoken of <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Treachery againſt <hi>David;</hi> yet was it Prophetically ſpoken of <hi>Judas</hi> his Treaſon againſt Chriſt; and the Expreſſion of <hi>lifting up the heel,</hi> is Metaphorical, taken from a fed Beaſt, that Kicks againſt his Maſter. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt did, and his followers do, daily ſuffer, not only from open Enemies, but from boſom and familiar Friends. Lord! How many are there in the World, who by profeſſion lift up their Hand unto thee; who yet by Treaſon and Rebellion lift up their Heel againſt thee.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Now I tell you before it come, that when it is come to paſs, ye may believe that I am <hi>he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here another Argument occurs, to prove the Divinity of our Bleſſed Saviour; from his fore knowledge of <hi>Judas</hi> his Treaſon, the perſon who, the Time when, and the Place where, were all known to Chriſt. <hi>I tell you before it come to paſs.</hi> The Argument lies thus, He that foreſaw the future Actions of Men, and infallibly foreknew the future Events and Iſſues of things, is certainly God. But Chriſt did this; therefore he is really God: And he tells us here, that for this very Reaſon, he foretold now the Treaſon of <hi>Judas; Now I tell you before, that when it is come to paſs, ye may believe that I am He.</hi> What <hi>He</hi> doth he mean? What <hi>He</hi> could foretel ſo many things to come, which did not depend upon neceſſary, but contingent cauſes onely? This <hi>He</hi> was not a meer Man ſurely, for he knows not what ſhall be on the morrow; but muſt be real God, becauſe he knew all things; not by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, as the Prophets knew things to come; but by immediate inſpection, and ſimple intuition; ſo that we may ſay with <hi>Peter, Lord, Thou knoweſt all things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou knoweſt all things, thou art God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 Verily verily I ſay unto you, He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth whomſoever I ſend, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</p>
               <p>Leſt his Apoſtles ſhould think that for the Treachery of one of them, they ſhoul all become odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to the whole World; our Saviour encourages them with this promiſe and aſſurance, that there ſhould be thoſe that would receive them; and he would take it as kindly, as if they received himſelf, <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me. Learn hence,</hi> That it is a ſweet encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Miniſters of Chriſt; unto the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Duty; that Chriſt and the Father account that the reſpect paid to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is paid to themſelves; and on the contrary, that all the contempt caſt upon them, reflects upon themſelves. <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 When Jeſus had thus ſaid, he was troubled in ſpirit, and teſtified and ſaid, Verily verily I ſay unto you, that one of you ſhall betray me. 22 Then the diſciples looked one on another doubting of whom he ſpake.</p>
               <p>Oh what an aſtoniſhing word was this, <hi>one ſhall betray me;</hi> one of <hi>my Diſciples</hi> ſhall betray me, yea one <hi>of you,</hi> my Diſciples and Apoſtles ſhall do it; well might they look one upon another with ſorrow and amazement, to hear that their Maſter ſhould die; that he ſhould die by Treaſon, and that the Traitours ſhould be one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet do not they cenſure one another, but ſuſpect themſelves, ſaying, Maſter is it I? not Maſter is it <hi>Judas! Learn hence,</hi> 1. That it is poſſible for ſecret wickedneſs to lurk, yea for the greateſt villany to lodge in the hearts of Profeſſors, in whoſe Converſation appeareth nothing that may give a juſt ſuſpicion to others. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That it is both the duty and property of the Diſciples of Chriſt, to have ſo much Candour and Brotherly Love, as not raſhly to cenſure and judge one another, but to hope the beſt of others, and to fear the worſt of themſelves.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Now there was leaning on Jeſus boſom, one of his diſciples whom Jeſus loved. 24 Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he ſhould ask who it ſhould be of whom he ſpake. 25 He then lying on Jeſus breaſt, ſaith unto him, Lord, who is it? 26 Jeſus anſwered, He it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the ſop, he gave it to Judas Iſcariot, <hi>the ſon</hi> of Simon. 27 And after the ſop, Satan entred into him. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, That thou doeſt, do quickly. 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he ſpake this unto him. 29 For ſome <hi>of them</hi> thought, becauſe Judas had the bag, that Jeſus had ſaid unto him, Buy <hi>thoſe things</hi> that we have need of againſt the feaſt: or that he ſhould give ſomething to
<pb facs="tcp:46556:152"/> the poor. 30 He then having received the ſop, went immediately out: and it was night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Character given of St. <hi>John</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple, he leaned on Chriſt's Boſom; that is, he had moſt intimate converſe with Chriſt, one whom Chriſt treated with greater freedom and familiarity than the reſt, and one that knew more of his Heart than moſt of his Diſciples. We commonly call a very near Friend a Boſom Friend. <hi>Learn,</hi> That altho' Chriſt had an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared love for all his Diſciples and followers; yet there were degrees in Chriſt's own love, and he had a famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with ſome Diſciples beyond others, whileſt he was here upon Earth, even as now in Heaven; tho' his Heart be towards all his Children here on Earth, yet he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let out more kind Manifeſtations of himſelf, and more ſenſible Evidences of his love towards ſome, than towards others. <hi>John</hi> was the Diſciple that lay in Jeſus his Boſom. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The way which our Saviour took to diſcover <hi>Judas</hi> to the reſt of his Diſciples, not by naming of him, but by giving him a Sop; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not give <hi>Judas</hi> any provocation, by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of his Name, and partly becauſe this ſign of eating the Sop was moſt agreeable to the Prophetical Prediction. Pſ. 41.9. <hi>Mine own familiar friend who did eat of my Bread, hath lift up the heel againſt me. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. The time when <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sop, and the conſequent that followed upon his receiving of it; it was at that time when he had with an unbelieving Heart, and an unthankful Spirit been eating the Paſſover, which was a Type of Chriſt. Now <hi>Satan enters into him;</hi> that is, takes fuller poſſeſſion of him, and he gives up himſelf more freely and fully to the Devil's conduct and ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Satan gets poſſeſſion of wicked Men gradually and by degrees, not all at once; the only way to be ſafe, is to reſiſt the beginnings of Sin, for when Satan once gets footing, it is hard to prevent a more full poſſeſſion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The place where <hi>Judas</hi> now was, <hi>Namely,</hi> at <hi>Bethany,</hi> ſome Miles from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and it was now Night; yet ſo intent he was upon the Devil's work, that away he trudges to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at that time of the Night repairs to the high Prieſts, and ſells his Saviour into their hands. Oh what a warmth and zeal was here in the Devil's cauſe! Men given over by God poſſeſt by Satan, are ſo reſtleſs and unwearied in Sin, that neither by day nor by Night can they ceaſe from the contrivance and execution of it.</p>
               <p n="31">31 ¶ Therefore when he was gone out, Jeſus ſaid, Now is the ſon of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 32 If God be glorified in him, God ſhall alſo glorifie him in himſelf, and ſhall ſtraightway glorifie him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Our bleſſed Lord calls his Death his glory. <hi>Now is the Son of Man glorified.</hi> That is, now is the time at hand when I am to die, and ſhall by my Death finiſh the work of Man's Redemption, and thereby eminently glorifie God. God the Father was eminently glorified in the Obedience and Sufferings of his dear and only Son. It is true, that the Sufferings of Chriſt were Ignominious in themſelves, yet were they the way to his own Glory, and his Father's alſo; for by them he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed a loſt World, trampled upon Satan, triumphed over Sin. And the Father was exceedingly glorified by the Son's giving Obedience to his Will, and ſo chearfully Suffering. <hi>Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> An indearing compellation, a ſweet Title given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Little Children,</hi> intimating that tender Affection which he bare unto them, tho' now upon the point of departing from them. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That whatever Chriſt's dealings are, or may be with his People; in reſpect of his removing and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from them; yet he ſtill retains the relation of a Father to them, and will in his abſence from them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſuch a care over them, as Parents have of their young and tender Children; ſo much doth the Title of Little Children imply and import. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The plain intimation which our Saviour gives to his Diſciples of his death being very nigh, (for it was the very next day,) he tells them, he was going to Heaven, <hi>and whither he went, they could not come;</hi> that is, not preſently; they ſhould follow him their forerunner, afterwards, but at preſent, he had a great deal of work for them to do, tho' his own work was done, and till they had finiſhed their work. <hi>Whither He went they could not come. Learn hence,</hi> That tho' it be Reſt which the Saints may lawfully deſire, an everlaſting reſt with Chriſt in glory; yet muſt they not refuſe to labour, whileſt their Lord will have it ſo. Till their work be done, whither Chriſt is gone they cannot come; <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, but whither I go,</hi> at preſent, <hi>ye cannot come.</hi>

               <p n="34">34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having mentioned his departure from his Diſciples in the former Verſe; <hi>I go away, and whither I go ye cannot come.</hi> In this and the following Verſes, he gives them a ſtrict charge, that in his abſence they ſhould love one another. This he calls <hi>a new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> not that it was new in regard of Inſtitution, but of Reſtitution; not new in regard of the Subſtance of it, for it was a Branch of the Law of Nature, and a known precept of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. But he calls it a new Commandment. 1. Becauſe purged from the old corrupt gloſſes of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who had limited this duty of Love, and confined it to their own Country-men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt enlarges the object, and obliges his Diſciples to love all mankind, even their very Enemies. 2. Becauſe this Duty of Love was ſo greatly advanced and heightned by our Saviour, as to the meaſures and degrees of it, even to the laying down of our Lives one for another. 3. It is called a new Commandment, becauſe urged from a new Motive, and enforced by a new Example. <hi>As I have loved you,</hi> that ye alſo love one another; never was this Duty ſo effectually taught, ſo mightily encouraged, ſo much urged and inſiſted upon by any Teacher as our Saviour; and never was there ſuch an Example given of it as his own. 4. 'Tis a new Commandment, becauſe with the reſt it was never to wax old; but to be always freſh in the memory and practice of Chriſt's Diſciples to the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="35">35 By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another.</p>
               <p>To recommend the foregoing Duty of loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the greater advantage; our Saviour tells us here, that it will be the beſt Evidence of our Relation to him as ſincere Diſciples. <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples. Where Obſerve,</hi> 1. Our Saviour doth not ſay, by this, Men ſhall conjecture and gueſs that you belong to me, as being my Diſciples, but they ſhall certainly know it. 2. He doth not ſay, by this ſhall you know your ſelves to be my Diſciples, and one another to be ſo; but by this ſhall all others know it as well as your ſelves. 3. He doth not ſay, by this ſhall all Men know that you look like my Diſciples; but that you are indeed what you pretend to be. <hi>Namely,</hi> By your loving one another. 4. Chriſt doth not ſay, by this ſhall the World know that you are my Diſciples. <hi>Namely,</hi> By your aſſembling often together in my Houſe of Prayer, by your frequent faſtings, by your reading the Scriptures Daily, by your hearing Sermons Weekly, by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments Monthly; all theſe put together will be no ſufficient evidence of your Diſciple-ſhip, if you keep up a ſecret grudg in your Hearts one againſt another. <hi>But by this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another. Learn hence,</hi> That one of the beſt Proofs and Evidences we can have of our relation to Chriſt, as his ſincere Diſciples, is an hearty love and good will one towards another.</p>

               <p>Here we find <hi>Peter</hi> reflecting upon what our Saviour had ſaid juſt before. <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>Whither I go ye cannot come;</hi> he is inquiſitive to know of Chriſt whither he went. Our Lord tells him, that for the preſent he could not follow him, but ſhould hereafter; he was not as yet ſtrong enough to ſuffer for him, as he ſhould and did afterwards. St. <hi>Peter</hi> grieved at this, raſhly reſolves to follow him, tho' he ſhould die for his ſake. Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes him not to be over-confident of his own ſtrength and ſtanding; for he ſhould deny him Thrice, within the Time of Cock-crowing. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How that fond Conceit which our Lord's Diſciples had of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom here in this World, did abide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with them to the very laſt; for when Chriſt ſpake of leaving them, by Aſcending into Heaven, <hi>Peter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands him of a removal that was Earthly, from one place to another, whereas Chriſt intended it of a removal from Earth to Heaven. The Opinion that the Meſſiah was to be a Temporal Prince, and that his Kingdom ſhould be of this World, was ſo deeply rooted in the Minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ſtumbled at it fatally; and Chriſt's own Diſciples had ſo drunk in the notion, that they wonder to hear Chriſt ſay, that he is going from them, and that whither he goes they cannot come. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That Chriſt's Diſciples ſhall certainly follow their Maſter afterwards, and be for ever with the Lord; but they muſt wait their Lord's time, and finiſh their Lord's work; they muſt patiently wait for their Change, and not peeviſhly wiſh for it; for tho' they do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt preſently to Heaven, they ſhall follow him afterwards. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The greatneſs of St. <hi>Peters</hi>'s ſelf-confidence. <hi>I will lay down my Life for thy ſake.</hi> Good Man! He reſolved honeſtly, but too too much in his own ſtrength; Little, Oh little, did he think what a Feather he ſhould be in the wind of Temptation, if once God left him to the power and prevalency of his own fears. The holieſt of Men knows not his own ſtrength, till Temptation brings him to the Trial. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> How deteſtable St. <hi>Peters</hi>'s Preſumption and Self-Confidence was to Chriſt, and how fatal and pernicious to himſelf. <hi>Wilt thou lay down thy Life for my ſake?</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> Thou ſayeſt more than thou can'ſt do. Thine own ſtrength will fail thee, and thy Self-Confidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee; I know thy Heart better than thou doſt thy ſelf; and I foreſee, that <hi>before the Cock crows thou wilt deny me thrice.

               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour in the foregoing Chapter, having acquainted his Diſciples with his approaching Death, by the Treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> their Hearts were thereupon over-whelmed with Grief and Trouble. Accordingly in this Chapter, by ſundry Arguments he comforts his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples againſt the perplexity of their fears and ſorrows. 1. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> How Chriſt addreſſes himſelf to his Diſciples in a very endearing and Affectionate manner; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled. Whence learn,</hi> 1. That the Beſt and Holieſt of God's Children and Servants, whileſt here in an imperfect ſtate, are ſubject to deſponding, diſquieting and diſtruſtful fears. 2. That no work is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our Saviour, than to comfort the troubled and perplexed Spirits of his Servants. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which Chriſt preſcribes for the calming their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fears, and for arming them againſt future troubles; and that is Faith in the Father and himſelf <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me. Here learn,</hi> 1. That God is the ſupream object of Faith; his unchangeable love and faithfulneſs, with his infinite Power in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of his promiſes, is the ſecurity of Believers. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That Chriſt, as Mediatour between God and guilty Creatures, is the immediate object of our Faith. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3. That Chriſt being the true and proper object of our Faith, is a proof of his being truly and really God. Chriſt doth here aſſert his own Deity in the ſubſtance of the Command, in making himſelf an object of Faith, in Conjunction with God the Father. <hi>Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me. Obſerve,</hi> Next the Arguments of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which Chriſt propounds for the ſupport of his Diſciples under the ſorrow, which they had conceived for his approaching departure. 1. He tells them, That Heaven, whither he was now going, was his Father's Houſe, a place of happineſs, not deſigned for himſelf alone; but for many more to enjoy a perpetual reſt and abode in, as in everlaſting Manſions, <hi>in my Father's Houſe are many manſions.</hi> Heaven is God's Houſe, in which he will freely converſe with his Domeſticks, his Children and Servants; and they ſhall enjoy full glory there, as in a quiet and capacious habitation: A ſecond ground of Comfort is, that he aſſures them he will come again and receive them to himſelf, that they may live together with him in the Heavenly Manſions. This promiſe Chriſt makes good to his Saints, partly at the day of their Death, and perfectly at the day of Judgment; when he ſhall make one errand for all, and take up all his Children to himſelf, and make them compleatly happy both in Soul and Body with himſelf. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That tho' Chriſt has removed his Bodily preſence from his Friends on Earth; yet his love to them is not ceaſed, nor will he reſt ſatisfied till he and they meet again; Eternally to ſolace themſelves in each others Company. <hi>I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am there you may be alſo.</hi> A Third Argument for Conſolation is, That notwithſtanding Chriſt was to leave them; yet they knew whither he went: <hi>Namely,</hi> To Heaven, and which was the way thither; <hi>Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</hi> It contributes much to the Comfort of Believers, as to know God and Heaven, ſo to know the way that leads thither, that ſo they may be armed againſt all the difficulties of that way.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Thomas ſaith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goeſt, and how can we know the way? 6 Jeſus ſaith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How <hi>Thomas</hi> and probably divers others of the Apoſtles, notwithſtanding all that Chriſt had ſaid to the contrary, did ſtill dream of a Temporal Kingdom, and ſuppoſed him to ſpeak of ſome Earthly Pallace which he was going to; and therefore he tells our Saviour he knew not whither he was going. But Chriſt meaning not a Temporal, but Heavenly Kingdom, tells them that if they intended to follow him, and be with him in Heaven, He himſelf was the only way thither. <hi>I am the way, the Truth and the Life.</hi> That is, I am the True and Living way to the Father; <hi>And no Man cometh to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by me.</hi> That is, no Man can have any acceſs to God by Prayer, or any other Act of Religious Worſhip here on Earth, or any acceſs to God in Heaven, but by me as Mediatour.</p>
               <p n="7">7 If ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo: and from henceforth ye know
<pb facs="tcp:46556:153"/> him, and have ſeen him. 8 Philip ſaith unto him, Lord, ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us. 9 Jeſus ſaith unto him, Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet haſt thou not known me, Philip? he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father; and how ſayeſt thou <hi>then,</hi> Shew us the Father? 10 Believeſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf: but the Father, that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 11 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me that I <hi>am</hi> in the Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in me: or elſe believe me for the very works ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. What a groſs conception the Apoſtles had, and St. <hi>Philip</hi> in particular, of the Divine Nature and Being, as if God the Father could be ſeen with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Eyes. <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſuffices us.</hi> It is not eaſie to determine what degrees of Ignorance may conſiſt with ſaving Grace; doubtleſs, as the degrees of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and means of Knowledge are more or leſs; ſo a perſon's Ignorance is more or leſs excuſable before God. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How meekly our Bleſſed Saviour Reproves their Ignorance; <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet haſt thou not known me? Philip!</hi> and then proceeds to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in, and farther acquaint them with, the One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of himſelf with his Father, and the perſonal Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in himſelf. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Father being inviſible in his Eſſence; to know or ſee him with mortal bodily eyes, is impoſſible; but he was ſeen in his Son, who is the expreſs Image of the Father; being one in Eſſence with him, and one in operation alſo <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater <hi>works</hi> then theſe ſhall he do; becauſe I go unto my Father.</p>
               <p>Here Chriſt gives his Diſciples a promiſe of enduing them with Power after his Departure to work Miracles, in ſome reſpect greater than what he wrought himſelf; not greater in regard of the manner, for he wrought by his own Power, and they wrought all in his Name. But greater in regard of the matter of them; particularly, their ſpeaking with ſtrange Tongues, their giving the Holy Ghoſt by laying on of Hands, their healing Diſeaſes by the very ſhadow of their Bodies; but eſpecially by their wonderful converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſerve the living God. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> converted Three Thouſand at one Sermon, then Chriſt made good this promiſe; the Diſciple at that time appeared to be above his Maſter; Chriſt all his time was Angling for a few Fiſhes, and catch'd but an Hundred and Twenty. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. Whilſt <hi>Peter</hi> comes with his Dragnet, and catcheth Three Thouſand at one caſt; the reaſon might be, becauſe Chriſt was not properly to be the Builder, but the Foundation it ſelf. He ſubjoins the Reaſon of all this, <hi>Becauſe I go unto my Father;</hi> that is, to ſend down and pour forth upon you my Apoſtles, the Holy Ghoſt on the Day of Pentecoſt; which was the great cauſe of the Apoſtles Miraculous Operations. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That it pleaſed the Wiſdom of Chriſt to do greater things by the hand of his weak Servants, here in the World, than he was pleaſed to do himſelf, who was God over all Bleſſed for evermore.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If ye ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour produces another Argument to quiet his Diſciples Hearts, under their perplexity and trouble for the loſs of his Bodily preſence; he aſſures them, that whatever Comforts they enjoyed by his Preſence, they ſhall obtain by their Prayers. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Qualification requiſite in Prayer; we muſt Pray <hi>in Chriſt's name,</hi> that is, for the ſake of his Merits and Mediation; in Obedience to God's command, and and with an Eye at his Glory, and for things agreeable to his Will, and for things which his Wiſdom ſees good for us. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The promiſe made to ſuch Prayers, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do;</hi> he ſaith not, that will my Father do, but that will I do, to teſtifie his Divine Power and oneneſs with the Father. This evidently proves him to be God. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the promiſe for the further confirmation of it. <hi>If ye ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is doubled for the farther Confirmation of it; that ſo we might be free from all fears and doubts of being heard, when we put up our Prayers to God, in the Name and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, for things agreeable to his Will. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That altho' the Children of God, have ſometimes many Jealouſies and Fears ariſing in their Minds concerning the Anſwer of their Prayers, yet they are altogether groundleſs; for it is moſt certain their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhall be granted them, ſo far as the Wiſdom of God ſees ſit and convenient for them; and for that reaſon our Saviour redoubles the Promiſe. <hi>If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 ¶ If ye love me, keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour implicitly reproves his Diſciples, for their fond way of expreſſing their Love to him, by doating upon his Bodily preſence, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing immoderately for his abſence, and he expreſly warns them to evidence their Love to him, by their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his commands. <hi>If ye love me, keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Where Obſerve,</hi> Chriſt requires an Obedient Love and loving Obedience. Love without Obedience is but diſſimulation; Obedience without Love is but drudgery and ſlavery. Such a Love as produces Obedience, it muſt be a Dutiful Love, a Love of Reverence and Honour to him as a Commander. And an operative and working Love, a labour of Love as the Apoſtle calls it; not wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers but workers are the beſt Servants in Chriſt's eſteem. And ſuch an Obedience as is the product of Love; it will be a willing, eaſie and chearful Obedience, a pleaſing and an acceptable Obedience. A conſtant and Abiding Obedience: All other motives without Love are ſervile and baſe, and beget in us the drudgery of a Slave, but not the Duty of a Son; he that fears God only, is afraid of ſmarting, but he that Loves God is afraid of offending. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the beſt and ſureſt evidence we can have of our Love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is an humble, chearful, univerſal, and perſevering Obedience to his commands; keep my Commandments, that is, endeavour it without reſerve; for tho' we cannot keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to a juſt ſatisfaction; yet we may perform them to a gracious acceptation. And the Word <hi>My,</hi> My Commandments is a ſweetning and alleviating Word. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, an unſupportable Load, but Chriſt's Law an eaſie Burthen. The Law from <hi>Sinai</hi> dreadful, the Law from <hi>Sion</hi> Gracious; it pardons weakneſs, and accepts ſincerity.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 17 <hi>Even</hi> the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</p>
               <p>Chriſt comforteth his Diſciples here, with a promiſe of the Miſſion of the Holy Spirit, to ſupply the want of his Bodily preſence. <hi>Where Obſerve,</hi> The procurer of this Bleſſing. 1. And that is Chriſt, by his prevailing Prayer and powerful Interceſſion. <hi>I will pray,</hi> it runs in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Tenſe; and ſo 'tis a promiſe of Chriſt's continual Interceſſion. As long as Chriſt is in Heaven, a Chriſtian ſhall not want a ſupply of Comfort and Conſolation here on Earth. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Author and Donour of the bleſſing, and that is, God himſelf; <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give. The Father,</hi> that is, my Father, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:46556:154"/> and he that is the Father of Comfort and all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. <hi>I will pray and he will give.</hi> 'Tis an expreſſion of great aſſurance. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The bleſſing it ſelf, the Holy Ghoſt, called here <hi>Another Comforter. Where note,</hi> 1. The Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, he that will ſupply the Comforts of Chriſt's preſence, muſt be as Chriſt is, the God of all Comfort. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, he is a Divine perſon, not a Divine quality or operation; then we might call him a Comfort, but not a Comforter. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. The Office and Imployment of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>He is a Comforter;</hi> that is, an Advocate and Interceſſour to ſue for us, an Encourager, and one that Adminiſters Conſolation to us; and as he is an Holy Spirit, ſo are his Comforts Holy Comforts. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The ſtability of this Bleſſing, <hi>That he may abide with you for ever.</hi> The beſt of our outward Comforts are ſudden flaſhes, not laſting flames, but the Conſolations of the Holy Spirit are ſtrong Conſolations; they are abounding Conſolations, and everlaſting Conſolations, eſpecially the Holy Spirit will be the Comforter of good Men in the day of Affliction, in the day of Temptation, and at the hour of Death, when all other comforts flag and fail. <hi>Obſerve laſtly,</hi> The additional Title given to the Holy Ghoſt, he is called <hi>the Spirit of Truth;</hi> partly in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Satan, who is called a Lying Spirit; partly becauſe he teacheth and revealeth the Truth, leadeth his People into all Truth, and ſealeth and confirmeth Truth to the Souls of Believers; he is the Spirit of Truth, both in his Eſſence and in his Operations. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That as the Holy Spirit is True in his Eſſence and Nature, ſo is he True in his Office as a Comforter to good Men. All his Conſolations being real and ſolid, and free from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and deluſion.</p>
               <p n="18">18 I will not leave you comfortleſs; I will come to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. The Condition which the Diſciples were in, upon the account of Chriſt's removal from them, and that was ſad and Comfortleſs; Fatherleſs, or Orphans, as the word ſignifies. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That Chriſt's Departure, or the loſs of his gracious Preſence, is very ſad and Comfortleſs to a Pious Soul; well might the Diſciples here lament and mourn, upon the occaſion of Chriſt's leaving of them, ſeeing thereby they ſhould be deprived of his Doctrine and Inſtructions, of his Advice and Counſel, and of the Benefit of his Holy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Example. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The care of Chriſt for his Diſciples, in reference to this their ſad and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Condition. <hi>He would not leave them Comfortleſs. Where Note,</hi> He doth not ſay, I will not ſuffer you to be comfortleſs, but I will not leave you ſo; that is, he will not deſert or diſown them in their comfortleſs Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he will not leave them, either in point of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in point of Activity: he will not ceaſe to Love them, nor ceaſe to beſtir himſelf for them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt will not leave his Friends in a ſad and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs ſtate and Condition; tho' for a time they may be brought into it. <hi>I will not leave you Comfortleſs; I will come unto you.</hi> Chriſt's coming here unto them, is to be underſtood of his coming to them by his Holy Spirit; in the Gifts of it, in the Graces of it, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it; thus he did not long leave them Comfortleſs, but at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt came again to them.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more: but ye ſee me: becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo. 20 At that day ye ſhall know, that I <hi>am</hi> in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour foretels his approaching Death, that within a little time the Men of the World ſhould ſee him no more; for tho' he aroſe again, the World ſaw him no more, after his Death; for we Read of no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of him, after his Reſurrection to any, but to his Diſciples only; indeed the hour is coming when the World ſhall ſee him again. <hi>Namely,</hi> At the Day of Judgment; when every Eye ſhall behold him with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Amazement. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The Conſolation given to his Diſciples; <hi>Ye ſhall ſee me, and becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> Becauſe I am raiſed from the Grave, I will quicken your Dead Bodies in the Grave, and ye ſhall live alſo; and as I live by my Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo ſhall you my Diſciples live a Life of Grace here, and a Life of Glory with my ſelf hereafter. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That a Believer's Spiritual Life is derived from Chriſt, who by his Spirit Communicates a quickening vertue to all his Members: becauſe he lives they ſhall live alſo. <hi>Obſerve laſtly,</hi> A farther priviledge enſured to Believers after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, and the Spirits Miſſion; they ſhould more perfectly underſtand the Eſſential union, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and the Father, and the Myſtical Union betwixt Chriſt and his Members. <hi>At that Day ye ſhall know that I am in my Father,</hi> &amp;c. The knowledge which the Saints now have of the Myſterious and Myſtical Union, is but dark and imperfect; but in Heaven they ſhall underſtand theſe things clearly.</p>
               <p n="21">21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</p>
               <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour in theſe words repeats what he had before injoined, at Verſe 15. <hi>Namely,</hi> to evidence the ſincerity of our Love to him, by the Univerſality of our Obedience to his Commands. <hi>He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. Where Note,</hi> 1. The Neceſſity of Knowledge in order unto Practice. 2. The Neceſſity of Practice in order unto Happineſs; we muſt firſt have Chriſt's Commandments before we can keep them, we muſt have them in our Underſtandings and Judgments, in our Wills and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not have them only in our Eyes to read, in our Ears to hear, or in our Mouths to talk of them; but to hide them in our Hearts, that we may not Sin againſt Chriſt in the wilful violation of them: Farther we muſt keep, as well as have theſe Commandments. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes an univerſal, diligent, and perſevering Obedience to them. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> That altho' many looſe Profeſſors pretend love to Chriſt, becauſe they hear, read, know, and can talk of his Commandments; yet in Chriſt's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, none do truly love him, but thoſe who make Conſcience of their Obedience to him. <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve next,</hi> The gracious Promiſe of Chriſt, to ſuch as thus expreſs their Love unto him. 1. <hi>He ſhall be loved of my Father, and of my ſelf,</hi> And ſhall he not be loved of the Holy Ghoſt too? Yes, no doubt: But why is not he named then? Becauſe the Son dwelleth in us by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſheds his Love abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt. 2. <hi>I will manifeſt my ſelf unto him;</hi> that is, ſuch Obedient Chriſtians ſhall not only injoy the Fruit and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of my Love, but they ſhall injoy the Senſe of my Love, and experience the ſenſible manifeſtations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diffuſions of my Love in their own Souls. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the only way to have Chriſt Love us, and to let out his Love upon us, and to know that he Loves us, is to look diligently to our Obediential walking with him and before him. We may as rationally think to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our Bodies with Poiſon, as to injoy the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt's Love in a way of Sin.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Judas ſaith unto him, not Iſcariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the world?</p>
               <p>Some underſtand theſe words of a Temporal manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and think that <hi>Judas</hi> the Brother of <hi>James,</hi> who ſpake them, ſtill expected that Chriſt ſhould be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, and have ſuch a Kingdom as ſhould be Conſpicuous to all the World; and therefore puts the queſtion how he could poſſibly ſhew himſelf to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the World not ſee him? Others underſtand it of a Spiritual manifeſtation; as if he had ſaid, Lord! who or what are we thy Diſciples that we ſhould enjoy more ſpecial manifeſtations of thy Love to us, than to the reſt of the World; why ſhould we be dignified with ſuch diſtinguiſhing favours above others? <hi>Learn thence,</hi> 1. That there is a real difference put by Chriſt, betwixt his own Children and the World, in the matter of ſpecial Manifeſtations. 2. That there being no cauſe from the
<pb facs="tcp:46556:154"/> Creature, why Chriſt ſhould make this difference, his diſcriminating Grace is matter of juſt and great Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; well might the Apoſtle out of a deep Admiration, ſay, <hi>Lord! how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 24 He that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings: and the word which you hear, is not mine, but the Fathers which ſent me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How our Saviour ſtill goes on to direct and encourage his Diſciples, to evidence the ſincerity of their Love to his Perſon, by the univerſality of their Obedience to his Commands; and tells them how great their Advantage would be by ſo doing. For <hi>Firſt, the Father will love them;</hi> that is, manifeſt his favour to them in farther diſpenſations of Grace and Comfort. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That all the Manifeſtations of Divine Love to the Souls of Believers, depend upon their cloſe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, in the paths of Holineſs and ſtrict O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. <hi>Secondly, We will make our abode with him.</hi> He ſhall have Father and Son's Company, an Alluſion to a Parent that has many Children; he will be ſure to live with them that are moſt Dutiful to him, and moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of him. The expreſſion of <hi>making their abode with us;</hi> denotes that ſweet and intimate fellowſhip which ſhall be betwixt God and us, and the perpetuity and conſtancy of it at all times; till we are taken up by him into Heaven, he will make his abode with us, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling preſence of his Holy Spirit, the Graces and Comforts, whereof ſhall abide with us for ever.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>yet</hi> preſent with you. 26 But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, <hi>which is</hi> the holy Ghoſt, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</p>
               <p>Here we have a repeated Promiſe of the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, called the Comforter, and his ſpecial Office declared. <hi>Namely,</hi> To teach and to bring to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what Chriſt had taught. <hi>He ſhall teach you all things.</hi> As the Spirit of God is the great Comforter, ſo he is the ſpecial Teacher of his Children; he Teacheth condeſcendingly, ſtooping to the meaneſt capacities; he Teacheth efficaciouſly, inclining the Heart to receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as opening the Ear to hear it; he Teacheth plainly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>learly, unerringly and infallibly; he is Truth it ſelf, and therefore his teachings are moſt True. And as the Holy Spirit is the Saints Teacher, ſo is he alſo their Remembrancer; <hi>He ſhall bring all things to your Remembrance;</hi> that is, all Truths needful to be known, and neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Here Note,</hi> That the Holy Spirit Teaches nothing but what Chriſt himſelf Taught; the Spirit Teaches in the word and by the word, but never Teaches any thing contrary to the word. <hi>He ſhall Teach and bring to Remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it be afraid.</p>
               <p>As if our Lord had ſaid, Whatever outward Trouble the World gives you, be not afraid of it before it comes; nor troubled at it when it is come, for I will give you inward Peace in the midſt of all your outward Troubles. <hi>Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Where Note,</hi> That Chriſt's Peace is vaſtly different from that Peace which is given, or enjoyed by the World; the World may wiſh Peace, yet never intend it, or they may wiſh it, yet not be able to give it; but Chriſt's Peace is real and effectual, ſolid and ſubſtantial; the World's Peace is only a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from outward trouble, but Chriſt's Peace is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from inward guilt; and tho' it doth not give us an exemption from outward Troubles; yet it gives us a ſanctified uſe and improvement of them, and aſſures us of a Joyful Iſſue and deliverance out of them.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Ye have heard how I ſaid unto you, I go away, and come <hi>again</hi> unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater then I.</p>
               <p>That the Diſciples of Chriſt might neither be overſet with fears, nor overwhelm'd with grief; he tells them that they ought to entertain the news of his departure rather with joy and exaltation, than with ſorrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> True Love to Chriſt will make us rejoyce in his Advancement and Exaltation, altho' it be to our own diſadvantage. Thoſe words, <hi>my Father is greater then I,</hi> muſt be underſtood with reference to his Humane Nature, as Mediatour; for ſo he was the Father's Servant, and the Father as God was greater than he as Man; again, the Father may be ſaid to be greater than Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Paternity, as being the fountain of the Deity; the Father is of himſelf, but the Son is begotten of the Father; but being of the ſame Subſtance with the Father, he is conſequently God as the Father is God; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality ariſes not from the Eſſence, but from the order and manner of Subſiſtence. Thus <hi>the Father was greater than He.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 And now I have told you before it come to paſs, that when it is come to paſs, ye might believe. 30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even ſo I do. Ariſe, let us go hence.</p>
               <p>The time of our Saviour's Death now nearer and nearer Approaching, he prepares the expectation of his Diſciples for it; becauſe evils that ſurprize us ſuddenly do ſink our Spirits ſadly, whereas, what we fear, for that we prepare. Accordingly our Lord arms his dear Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt all diſquietude, and over-whelming ſorrow for his Departure from them; I have told you before, that when it comes to paſs ye might believe; that is, be aſſured that I am not meer Man, but truly and really God, and depend upon me for Life and Salvation. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. How our Saviour points out the cauſe of his Sufferings. <hi>Namely,</hi> Satan and his Inſtruments, <hi>The Prince of this World cometh;</hi> that is, by <hi>Judas,</hi> the Soldiers, and the High Prieſts, <hi>but he has nothing in me;</hi> that is, he will find no Sin or Corruption in me to ſide with his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or no guilt upon me to give him any Advantage againſt me, for I ſhall Die as a perfectly Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Chriſt in Suffering for our Sins, did not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the wrath of God, but with the rage of Men and Devils; yet all the power and policy, all the malice and cruelty of Satan cannot prevail againſt Chriſt, any further than he voluntarily yields and ſubmits himſelf unto it. <hi>The Prince of this World cometh, but hath nothing in me. Obſerve,</hi> 3. That it was Chriſt's Love and Obedience to his Father, that carried him forth ſo chearfully to the work of Sufferings, ſupported him under it, and carried him thorough it. <hi>That the World may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me Commandment, even ſo I do.</hi> True Love to God will draw Men to Obedience in the hardeſt Services and Sufferings; the grand motive of Chriſt's Sufferings was Love to his Father, Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and a regard to his Glory. Lord, Let thy Love and Obedience to thy Father in all thy Sufferings, be the ſubject of our Admiration, and the matter of our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo. As the Father gives us Commandment, ſo let us always do.</p>

               <p n="1">1 I Am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away: and every <hi>branch</hi> that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How our bleſſed Saviour under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of a Vine elegantly ſets forth himſelf in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his viſible Church, ſhewing under that ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what his Father meant to do with <hi>Judas,</hi> and with all unfruitful Branches like unto him, even take them away, cut them off, and throw them into the Fire; but ſuch as are fruitful, he purges, by his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by Ordinances and Providences, by Mercies and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that they may be more aboundingly and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly fruitful. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Jeſus Chriſt in his offices for, and relation to his People, doth moſt fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a Vine. As the Vine is weak, mean, and ſmall in outward appearance; not like the Cedar for heighth, or like the Oak for ſtrength, ſo was Chriſt in his ſtate of humiliation; there was no beauty in him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. As the Vine is a fruitful Plant, tho' it has little pomp, yet has it much plenty, and is only uſeful for fruit-bearing, and brings forth both plenty and variety of ſweet fruit to make glad the Heart of Man; thus the fruits of Chriſt's Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Interceſſion, are many and great, delightful and ſweet. In a word, as the fruit of the Vine is preſſed that it may be Drink unto Men, ſo Chriſt ſubmitted to be Trod in the Wine-preſs of God's Wrath, that thereby the ſweeteſt fruit and benefit might redound to his People. Finally, as the Vine is the Root from which all the Branches derive their nouriſhment and fruitfulneſs; in like manner is Chriſt the Stock, into which all his Members are ingrafted; the Root in which they all ſubſiſt, and the fountain from whence their ſpiritual Life and Fruitfulneſs doth proceed and flow. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That as Chriſt is the Vine, ſo his Father is the Husbandman; he ingrafts and implants all the Branches into this Vine; the Plants of Righteouſneſs are of his own planting; he takes notice what ſtore of Fruit every Branch doth bring forth; and it is his daily care to dreſs and dung, to purge and prune, to ſupport and ſhelter his Vineyard, that it may bring forth Fruit abundantly. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3. That there are two ſorts of Branches in this Vnie, ſome fruitful, others unfruitful; ſome have the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but not the reality of Branches; ſome are branches only by external profeſſion, others are ſo by real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation. <hi>Learn,</hi> 4. That the true Touchſtone where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcern one ſort of Branches from another, is not by the fair Leaves of Profeſſion, but by the ſubſtantial Fruits of an Holy and Righteous Converſation. <hi>Learn,</hi> 5. That in the moſt fruitful Branches, in the beſt and holieſt of Chriſtians, there remains much Corruption to be purged out, in order to future and farther fruitfulneſs. <hi>Learn,</hi> 6. That the Husbandman's hand (God the Father's) manages the pruning Knife of Affliction, in order to his Peoples improvement in Grace and Holineſs; he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee his Vine Bleed, than ſee it Barren. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That ſuch Branches as after all the Husbandman's Care and Coſt remain unfruitful, ſhall be finally cut off and caſt away; as was <hi>Judas</hi> here, who in this Diſcourſe of our Saviour ſeems particularly and eſpecially to be aimed at: He was a Branch in him that bare no Fruit, who was ſhortly after taken away and went to his own place.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have ſpoken unto you. 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 5 I am the vine, ye <hi>are</hi> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having in the former Verſes diſtinguiſhed his Diſciples into two ſorts; ſome that were Members of his Body the Church, and Branches of him the true Vine, by outward ſhew and viſible profeſſion only; others that are ſpiritually ingrafted into him, and do bring forth much fruit; now in this third Verſe, Chriſt tells his Diſciples which number they were of: Now (ſaith he) ye are clean, thro' the word which I have ſpoken unto you; that is, Now that <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitour, that Dead, Rotten, fruitleſs Branch, is cut off and caſt out, ye are all clean, thro' the cleanſing Power and Vertue of my Word and Doctrine. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That ſuch as are juſtified by the Blood, and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, are in Chriſt's Account clean, notwithſtanding their many ſpots and manifold imperfections. <hi>Now are ye clean.</hi> 2. That as the Blood of Chriſt is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Spirit of Chriſt the efficacious; ſo the word of Chriſt is the Inſtrumental cauſe of a Believer's Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Cleanſing. <hi>Now are ye clean through the word which I have ſpoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you.</hi> That is, Abide in me, and I will abide in you; Abide in me, not only by an outward and viſible Profeſſion, but by a real and fiducial Adherence; and I will abide in you, by the influences and operations of my Holy Spirit. The Union and Conjunction between Chriſt and his Members is mutual, they abide in him by Faith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and he abides in them by the indwelling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Grace and Spirit. Abide in me, and I will abide in you. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Farther the Reaſon which Chriſt gives, why they ſhould thus abide in him, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Union with him, without intereſt in him, without influences of Grace derived from him; they could bring forth no fruit for him, nor do any thing that is truly acceptable and well-pleaſing to him. <hi>As the Branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me, for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> That is, As brances ſever'd from the Vine cannot live nor bear Fruit, ſo neither can Chriſtians ſeparated from Chriſt, and without deriving vertue from him do any thing ſpiritually good and well-pleaſing in the ſight of God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That not only unregenerate Men do labour under an impotency, to that which is ſpiritually good, but even Diſciples themſelves, without daily depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon Chriſt, and without conſtant communications of Grace from him, can do nothing in a lively and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way and manner unto him; without me <hi>Ye</hi> can do nothing, you that are Branches of me the true Vine.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and caſt <hi>them</hi> into the fire, and they are burned.</p>
               <p>Here our Holy Lord diſcovers the ſad and deplorable Condition of ſuch profeſſors, who pretending Relation to Chriſt, do yet bring forth no fruit unto him; he calls them wither'd Branches fit only for the Fire. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſuch as have had a long ſtanding in God's Vineyard, and contented themſelves with a withered profeſſion; they are in great danger of having God's blaſting added to their Barrenneſs. All their parts and gifts and common Graces will wither, and their fair Bloſſoms of Profeſſion will drop off; and at the great Day the Angels will gather theſe fruitleſs Branches toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and caſt them into Hell fire.</p>
               <p n="7">7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. A glorious priviledge declared. <hi>Ask what ye will, it ſhall be done unto you.</hi> Not that we are hereby warranted to ask what we pleaſe at God's hand, but our Will muſt be limited by the Word and Will of God; we muſt pray in Faith, and in the Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Jeſus Chriſt, and with a ſingle Eye at the Glory of God. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Condition upon which this priviledge is attainable. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my word abide in you;</hi> that is, practically and experimentally. If my Doctrine and Commands abide in your Hearts, and diſpoſe you to an Holy fruitfulneſs in your Lives, then ſhall all your juſt requeſts be granted. <hi>Learn,</hi> That ſuch as by Faith embrace the Promiſes, and by Obedience live up to the Precepts of the Goſpel, may in Prayer
<pb facs="tcp:46556:155"/> humbly ask of God what they will, with a due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Wiſdom and Will of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my diſciples.</p>
               <p>Our Lord here exhorts his Followers to an Holy fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in good works by a double Argument. One drawn from the Glory of God. <hi>Herein is my Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> The other from their own Advantage; <hi>ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples.</hi> That is, hereby ye ſhall evidence and prove your ſelves to be my Diſciples. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That a Chriſtian's abounding fruitfulneſs in good works, will abundantly conduce to the Honour and Glory of God, and alſo to his own Peace and Comfort, by being the beſt evidence of his Diſcipleſhip.</p>
               <p n="9">9 As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</p>
               <p>Lord! What a compariſon is here. As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; he doth not ſay, as the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved him; but ſo have I loved you; nor doth he ſay, as God hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; but <hi>As the Father,</hi> it is, <hi>verbum dilectionis,</hi> a word importing dearneſs of Affection; nor doth he ſay, the Father hath loved me, and I love you; but <hi>as</hi> the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; nor doth he ſay, as the Father hath loved me, ſo will I love you: but ſo <hi>have</hi> I loved you. This ſhews the priority of Chriſt's love, that he loved us firſt, and alſo denotes the invincible conſtancy of his love, and the indubitable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof. <hi>I have loved you:</hi> Follow me from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth, and from Earth to Heaven again; and you will find that every ſtep I have taken hath been in love. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has given full and ample Demonſtration of his great and wonderful love unto his Church and People. 2. That it is the Duty, and ought to be the ſingular care of every Chriſtian, to preſerve the ſweet ſenſe and inward diffuſions of Chriſt's love in their own Souls. <hi>Continue ye in my love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 If ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love: even as I have kept my Fathers commandments, and abide in his love.</p>
               <p>Chriſt had told his Diſciples in the foregoing Verſe, That he had <hi>loved them, even as the Father had loved him.</hi> That is, with an eternal love, with a real and operative love; with an immutable and conſtant love. In this Verſe he directs them how they may continue in the ſenſe of his Love. <hi>Namely,</hi> By their conſtant Obedience to his Commands, as his Obedience to his Father's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands had ſecured him a continuance in his Father's Love. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love.</hi> That is, in the ſenſe of my Love, and under the ſweet apprehenſions of it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That as our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt is the beſt Evidence of our Love to him, ſo is it the beſt means to preſerve and keep us in the ſenſe and aſſurance of his Love to us.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Theſe thing have I ſpoken unto you that my joy might remain in you, and <hi>that</hi> your joy might be full.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour declares the Ground and Reaſon, why he did ſo vehemently preſs and urge the Duty of being univerſally fruitful upon his Diſciples, and that was twofold. 1. <hi>That his joy might remain in them.</hi> That is, That the joy which he had in their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Obedience might remain with him; nothing is more deſired by Chriſt, than that he may have cauſe continually to rejoyce in the Faith and fruitfulneſs of his People. 2. <hi>That their joy in him might be full.</hi> This latter ariſes from the former; our joy in Chriſt reſults from Chriſt's joy in us; his delight in us, cauſes us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to delight in him. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That nothing is more deſired by Chriſt, than that the joy of his People ſhould be a full, ſolid, conſtant, and uninterrupted joy. 2. That the only way and means in order thereunto, is by an Holy fruitfulneſs in good works. <hi>All theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</p>
               <p>Our Lord had often in this farewel Sermon, of his, to his dear Diſciples, preſſed upon them the Duty of loving one another. <hi>ch.</hi> 13, and 14. And yet here he enforces it again from his own Example. <hi>As I</hi> have loved you, <hi>ſo</hi> love you one another; that is, as truly and as ſincerely for the manner, tho' not to the ſame proportion and degree. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt to love one another upon ſuch grounds, and in ſuch a way as he loved them, is that which his heart greatly deſires and is very much ſet upon. 2. That Chriſt's love unto Believers is both an obligation unto mutual love, and alſo a pattern and example for it. <hi>This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour gives his Diſciples an Evidence of the greatneſs of his love unto them. <hi>Namely,</hi> In his readineſs to lay down his Life for them, which is the higheſt expreſſion of Love to our deareſt Friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Life is the greateſt earthly bleſſing. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt's Love in laying down his Life for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was a matchleſs Love; for whilſt they were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him, he had a friendly reſpect for them, and never ceaſed till he had brought them into a covenant of friendſhip with himſelf.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</p>
               <p>Here Chriſt invites his People to Obedience, by the honourable title of Friends. <hi>Ye are my Friends.</hi> 1. Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely, you will declare and manifeſt your ſelves to be my Friends. 2. Paſſively, I will declare my ſelf to be your Friend. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. How condeſcending is the Love of Chriſt, in calling his Servants by the name of Friends. 2. How glorious is the Believer's Relation to Chriſt, in being one of his Friends. 3. How grateful is Obedience to Chriſt, ſeeing it dignifies the Practiſers of it, with the Title of his Friends. 4. Our Conformity to Chriſt conſiſts not ſo much in imitation of what he did, as in Obedience to what he preſcrib'd. Some Actions of Chriſt are unimitable, but all his Commands are obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 5. That nothing ſhort of an humble, uniform, chearful and conſtant Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt, will Evidence the Truth of our Relation to him, and the ſincerity of our friendſhip with him. <hi>Then only are ye my friends, when you do whatever I command you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 Henceforth I call you not ſervants; for the ſervant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</p>
               <p>By theſe words Chriſt declares the Reaſon why he was pleaſed to change his ſtile, and call his Diſciples Friends inſtead of Servants. <hi>Namely,</hi> Becauſe of his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Secrets to them, which Servants are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the knowledge of. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> that is, not meer Servants, not that they were to be exempted from Obedience; (for that is called for in the foregoing Verſe,) but Chriſt treated them now with the kindneſs and familiarity of Friends; being about to leave them, he unboſoms himſelf unto them, ſaying, <hi>All things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you.</hi> Not, as if Chriſt had communicated the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Treaſures of knowledge to them, which the Father had imparted to him; but he ſpeaks here as the Prophet of his Church, that as ſuch he had revealed all things needful for them to know in order to Salvation; all things belonging to their Caſe and State; as a Counſellour doth not impart all his knowledg to his Clients; but all that is neceſſary for his Client to underſtand and know, that he makes known unto him; relating to his own Caſe. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That all Chriſt's Diſciples are his
<pb facs="tcp:46556:156"/> Servants, and all his Servants are his Friends, in regard of intimate Communion and tender uſage. <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervants but friends.</hi> And after his Reſurrection he called them Brethren, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. The Dignity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is a growing Dignity, the longer they follow Chriſt, the higher priviledges are indulged to them. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That all the Fathers counſel concerning our Salvation, and ſo far as it is needful and neceſſary for us to know, is faithfully revealed by Chriſt to his Church; he being conſtituted by God the Father to be the great Prophet and Inſtructer of it. <hi>All things that I have heard of the Father I have made known unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 Ye have not choſen me, but I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you, and ordained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and <hi>that</hi> your fruit ſhould remain: that whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour gives another Inſtance and Evidence of his Love to his Diſciples; He tells them that his mercy and free goodneſs had prevented them in their election to Eternal Salvation, and in their vocation unto the Office of Apoſtleſhip. <hi>Ye have not choſen me,</hi> to be your Maſter and Lord, <hi>but I have choſen you,</hi> to be my Diſciples, Friends, and Servants. 2. He acquaints them with the end, deſign, and intention of his, in chuſing of them. <hi>Namely, That they bring forth fruit,</hi> and perſevere therein, even in all the Fruits of Holineſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which are to the Praiſe and Glory of God by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I have ordained you that you ſhould bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould Remain.</hi> 3. He directs them that in order to their being fruitful, they ſhould have acceſs to the Father through him, for whatever they wanted and ſtood in need of. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name he will give it you. Learn hence,</hi> That all thoſe whom God hath choſen, and called to the knowledge and Service of Jeſus Chriſt, do and will make it their chief care and endeavours to bring forth Fruit, and to perſevere therein to their Lives end. <hi>I have choſen you, that you ſhould bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17 Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another. 18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before <hi>it hated</hi> you. 19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 20 Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the word that I ſaid unto you, The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is not greater then the lord. If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you: if they have kept my ſaying, they will keep yours alſo. 21 But all theſe things will they do unto you for my names ſake, becauſe they know not him that ſent me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. With what frequency and importunity our Lord inculcates and preſſes the Duty of mutual Love upon his Diſciples. <hi>I command you to love one another.</hi> It denotes the great importance of the Duty, and the great averſneſs and backwardneſs of our Hearts to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. And if we conſider the Diſciples as Apoſtles, and Miniſters of the Goſpel; it intimates to us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mutual Love amongſt the diſpenſers of the Goſpel, as conducing exceedingly to the welfare and benefit of the Church of God, over which he hath ſet them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Argument which our Saviour makes uſe of to preſs his Diſciples in general, and his Miniſters and Ambaſſadours in particular to love each other; and that is, becauſe the World would certainly hate them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the World's hatred of the Members and Miniſters of Chriſt is, and ought to be eſteemed by them, a ſtrong Argument to excite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to Love one another; for this is ſubjoined as an Argument to preſs mutual Love, that we are ſure to meet with the World's hatred. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The ſeveral Arguments by way of encouragement, which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to Comfort his Members and Miniſters againſt the World's hatred. 1. Argument is taken from his own Lot and uſage, when here in the World, he met with the very ſame before them. <hi>The World hated me before it hated you. Learn hence,</hi> That Hatred and Perſecution from the World, need not ſeem hard to the Saints, if they conſider what a ſhock Chriſt, before them, had upon him; he is the prime Object of the World's Hatred, and they who hate his Members much, do hate him more; becauſe of their likeneſs to him, and reſemblance of him. A ſecond Argument of Comfort under the World's Hatred, is this, That it will evidence they are not of the World; but choſen out of the World. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hates you. Hence learn,</hi> 1. That the Children of God though in the World, yet they are not of the World; they have not the Spirit of the World in them, nor is the Converſation of the World led by them. 2. That the difference betwixt them that are of the World, and thoſe that are choſen out of the World is of God's making. <hi>I have choſen you out of the World.</hi> 3. That ſuch Chriſtians as are ſeparated from the World in Judgment, Affection and Practice, muſt for that reaſon expect to be Hated and Perſecuted by the World. <hi>Becauſe ye are not of the World, therefore the World hates you.</hi> The Third Argument for Conſolation and Support, under the World's hatred, is taken from our Relation to Chriſt, as Servants to a Maſter, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, the Servant is not greater than his Lord.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, is it equal, That you ſhould expect better Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than my ſelf, either as to your Perſons or Miniſtry? or that you ſhould expect that the World ſhould better Receive your Doctrine than it did mine before you? <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That neither the Members nor Miniſters of Chriſt can, nor ought to expect better Entertainment in, and from, the World than he their Maſter found before them. <hi>The Servant is not above his Maſter, nor greater than his Lord.</hi> A Fourth Argument to ſupport them under the Burthen of the World's Hatred, is taken from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Cauſe, for which they were to Suffer, <hi>Namely,</hi> For Chriſt's Name ſake. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>All theſe things will they do unto you for my name ſake. Hence learn,</hi> 1. That it is the Duty of all, but eſpecially the Miniſters of Chriſt, to own the Name of Chriſt, to ſtand up in defence of his Name and Truth, his Glory and Honour; what oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever they meet with for the ſame. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the great quarrel of the World againſt the Diſciples of Chriſt, is for the Name of Chriſt, whatever may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; this is the ground of the quarrel.</p>
               <p n="22">22 If I had not come, and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin: but now they have no cloke for their ſin.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words are not to be underſtood Abſolutely but Comparatively; as if Chriſt had ſaid, had not I come amongſt them in my Incarnation, and Preached perſonally to them the Doctrine of Salvation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Doctrine by miraculous operations, they might have pleaded Ignorance in ſome meaſure; and, <hi>they had not had ſin;</hi> that is, they had not had the Sin of Unbelief, and Goſpel-Contempt to Anſwer for; or had not had ſo great a meaſure of any kind of Sin to Anſwer for, as now they have; but would have had more to ſay in excuſe, or for a cover for their Sin than now they can. <hi>But now they have no Cloak for their Sin;</hi> That is, they are totally inexcuſable, and have not the leaſt colour or pretence for their obſtinate unbelief. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Sins of Ignorance are as it were no Sins compared with Sins committed againſt light and Knowledge. 2. That Sins committed againſt Goſpel-Light, are of an heinous Nature, and Aggravated Guilt, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the very Remedy. 3. That the Goſpel where it is plainly preached doth take away all pretence and excuſe from Sinners. <hi>Now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 He that hateth me, hateth my Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. 24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin: but now they have both ſeen, and hated
<pb facs="tcp:46556:156"/> both me and my Father. 25 But <hi>this cometh to paſs,</hi> that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, they hated me without a cauſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe words declare the heinous Nature of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> ſin, in hating and perſecuting Chriſt, who had done before their Eyes ſuch Works as no Man beſides him, or before him, ever did; he acting by his own Power. <hi>Peter</hi> healed the lame Man, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. but it was in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> But Chriſt healed the ſick and raiſed the dead in his own Name, and by a ſpecial Word of Command; <hi>I ſay unto thee, Ariſe:</hi> Yet did the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hate him and his Father, according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 35.19. <hi>They hated me without a cauſe.</hi> Which being ſpoken of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Type,</hi> received a more eminent Accompliſhment in Chriſt the Son of <hi>David. Learn hence,</hi> 1. That let Men pretend to never ſo much Holineſs or Reſpect to God, yet if they hate Chriſt, and deſpiſe his Goſpel, they are haters of God, who is One in Eſſence and Nature with his Son: <hi>He that hateth me, hateth my Father alſo. Learn,</hi> 2. That no Miracles wrought by mortal Men, were ever comparable with the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by Chriſt the Son of God; his did ſurpaſs them all, in number, kind, and manner of doing them; by his own Authority, in his own Name, and not as others, who obtained their Power by Prayer from God. <hi>I have done amongſt them the works which none other man did. Learn,</hi> 3. That Chriſt's having confirmed his Doctrine by ſuch unparallel'd Miracles as the World was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquainted with, doth aggravate the ſin of thoſe that are Haters of his Perſon, Deſpiſers of his Doctrine, and Reproachers of his Miracles. It being juſt with God, when Men obſtinately ſhut their Eyes and will not ſee, judicially to cloſe their Eyes and ſay, They ſhall not ſee.</p>

               <p>Here our Holy Lord Comforts himſelf, that tho' he had lain then under many Aſperſions and Scandals from the World, yet all theſe ſhould be done away by the coming of the Holy Spirit, who ſhould teſtifie of him, and make his Perſon and Doctrine to be acknowledged in the World; and that they themſelves ſhould bear witneſs of him, who had been with him from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; that is, ſince he firſt began to exerciſe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Office. <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, are Three diſtinct Perſons in the Godhead. 2. That the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Son: Here the Son is ſaid to ſend him; and as to the Father, he is ſaid to proceed from him. If the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth not proceed from the Son, why is he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Spirit of the Son?</hi> Gal. 4.6.

That it is the high Dignity and Honour of the Apoſtles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, that the Spirit beareth no Teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, but with and according to the Teſtimony given by them; for here it is conjoyned, <hi>He ſhall teſtifie of me; and ye alſo ſhall bear witneſs, who have been with me from the beginning.</hi>

And theſe things I ſaid unto you at the beginning, becauſe I was with you.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of the foregoing Chapter our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had acquainted his Diſciples with the hatred and hard uſage which they were like to meet with from the World; and here he intimates to them the Reaſon why he did ſo much inſiſt upon the Subject; <hi>namely,</hi> not to ſadden their Hearts and grieve their Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Sufferings came, but <hi>that they might not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, diſcouraged,</hi> or <hi>ſcandalized</hi> at them when they came, but prepared for them and armed againſt them. <hi>Hence Learn,</hi> 1. That all Afflictions, but eſpecially Perſecutions, are ſo ſearching and trying, that the beſt of Chriſtians have need to be guarded againſt them, that they may not be offended at them. 2. That it was the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt to Arm his Diſciples againſt the Scandal of the Croſs, leſt ſtumbling at that which they expected not, they ſhould fall from the Profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that ye ſhould not be offended. Obſerve,</hi> 2. How our Saviour inſtances in two particular ſorts and kinds of Sufferings which his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were to expect, in the World and from the World, <hi>namely,</hi> Excommunication and Martyrdom, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>They ſhall put you out of their Synagogues;</hi> that is, exclude them from all their Aſſemblies both Civil and Religious, and ſhall not only think it lawful, but a very acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, to put them to death: <hi>Whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.

From whence we may Learn,</hi> That all the Perſecutions of the Saints, do ſpeak in Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors an Ignorance both of God the Father and of Jeſus Chriſt his Son. All Perſecution ſprings from Ignorance as well as from Malice. And Men who continue igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God and Chriſt, are in danger of turning Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, if they have a temptation to it. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. How our Lord again forewarns his Diſciples of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Sufferings, to the intent that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he had foretold them of them, and would not fail to ſupport them under them. He had often told them in general of Perſecutions and Troubles which they muſt expect to meet with, but did not till now intimate the kinds and degrees of thoſe Sufferings, with reſpect to their Weakneſs; and becauſe, whilſt he was with them, he himſelf bear the brunt of all; the Worlds Rage falling upon him, letting them along. But after his Aſcenſion, when the Malice of Satan and wicked Men could not reach him, then did the Storm fall upon them. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That Chriſt is ſo tender of his Diſciples Weakneſs, that he will not put them upon the hardſhip of Sufferings till they be trained up and prepared for them. 2. That it may encourage the Saints in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Sufferings, that Chriſt himſelf is the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Perſecutors Malice; and they only ſo, for his ſake; for could they reach him, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves with them. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3.

<pb facs="tcp:46556:157"/> we ſee how the Diſciples Thoughts were wholly taken up about themſelves, what they ſhould do for want of Chriſt's bodily Preſence, without being inſtant with him to know whither he was going, and what Benefit he ſhould reap, and they might expect from his departure. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt's Diſciples ought not ſo much to have lamented the loſs of his bodily Preſence, as to have rejoyced in his Glorious Exaltation, and in their own Advantages by his Death, Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>None of you ask me, Whither goeſt thou?

               <p n="7">7 Nevertheleſs, I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour urges his Diſciples to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Departure, as that which would make way for his ſending the Comforter to them; which he aſſures them would be of more Advantage to them than his own ſtay and continuance amongſt them. <hi>Thence learn,</hi> That the Preſence of the Holy Spirit with us, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Comfort and Advantage to us, than the Preſence of Chriſt in the Fleſh amongſt us. Chriſt's bodily Preſence was comfortable, but the Spirit is more intimately a Comforter than Chriſt in his fleſhly Preſence: Becauſe the Spirit can comfort all Believers at once, in all Places; but Chriſt's bodily Preſence can comfort but few, and that in one Place only, at once. Chriſt did converſe with his Diſciples outwardly, but the Spirit poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of their Hearts inwardly. Now for the Spirit to dwell in us, is more advantagious than to have Chriſt dwell in the Fleſh amongſt us. The Benefit of Chriſt's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was great, but the Advantage of the Spirit's Renovation and holy Inſpirations is much greater: The one encourages and excites us to be Holy, but the other quickens and enables us to be Holy. Therefore well might Chriſt ſay, <hi>It is expedient,</hi> or highly neceſſary and advantagious <hi>for you, that I go away.</hi> He ſubjoyns a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come; but if I depart, I will ſend him to you. Whence we learn,</hi> That Chriſt's Aſcenſion was indiſpenſably neceſſary, in order to the Spirit's Miſſion; the Spirit could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, if Chriſt had not firſt aſcended; the Spirit could not come, but by the Gift and Miſſion of the Mediator. Now the ſending of the Spirit being a part of Chriſt's Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, as Mediator, it was not convenient that the Spirit ſhould be ſent, till Chriſt was Crowned, and ſate down on his Throne in his Kingdom; then the Spirit was to make Application to us, of the Redemption purchaſed for us.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 9 Of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me; 10 Of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father, and ye ſee me no more; 11 Of judgment, becauſe the prince of this world is judged.</p>
               <p>In theſe and the following Verſes our Saviour acquaints his Diſciples with the Advantages that will redound by the coming of the Comforter. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Advantage to the World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the Apoſtles. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To himſelf. To the World, 1. <hi>He ſhall convince them of Sin, Righteouſneſs, and Judgment. Of Sin;</hi> that is, of their ſinful State and Nature; of the large extent of Sin; and particularly of the ſin of Unbelief. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Spirit of God is the Author of Conviction of Sin, and that all Convictions of Sin do either mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flow from him. 2. That Unbelief is a Sin of the greateſt malignity againſt Chriſt, and of greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to a Chriſtian's Soul. <hi>He ſhall convince the World of Sin, becauſe they believe not on me.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Of Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, of the inſufficiency of all humane Righteouſneſs, and of the neceſſity of the Righteouſneſs of a Mediator; by which alone we are to expect acceptance with God. Thirdly, <hi>Of Judgment;</hi> that is, the Spirit ſhall convince the World, that Jeſus is both Lord and Chriſt, that he had a Power to judge Satan the Prince of the World, and that he did by his Death put down the Kingdom of Darkneſs. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Satan is a Prince who by unjuſt Uſurpation, and the Sinners voluntary Conſent, has exerciſed a Tyrannical Power over the World. 2. That Chriſt by his Death, did judge, condemn and overcome this mighty Prince; and hath made his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt evident to the Conſciences of Men, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of his Holy Spirit. <hi>The Spirit ſhall convince of Judgment;</hi> that is, <hi>that Satan the Prince of this World is judged.</hi>

               <p n="12">12 I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 13 Howbeit when he the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth:</p>
               <p>The ſecond Benefit which our Saviour declares was to be expected by the coming of the Holy Spirit, relates to the Apoſtles themſelves. <hi>He ſhall guide you into all Truth;</hi> that is, into all Truth neceſſary for you to know in order to Salvation. This is a principal Text which the Papiſts bring for their Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but groundleſly: For this Promiſe was made to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> nay, not only to the Apoſtles, but to all their Succeſſors; yea, not to the Apoſtles only and their Succeſſors, but to all Believer: alſo; for they are led by the Spirit of God, and that into all Truth too; not abſolutely, but into all neceſſary Truth: And ſo far as a private Chriſtian follows the Conduct and Guidance of the Divine Spirit, he is more infallible than either Pope or Council, who follow the Dictates and Direction of their own Spirits only.</p>
               <p n="13">13 For he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf; but whatſoever he ſhall hear, <hi>that</hi> ſhall he ſpeak: and he will ſhew you things to come.</p>
               <p>That is, he ſhall not teach you a private Doctrine, or that which is contrary to what ye have learned of me; but whatſoever he ſhall hear of me, and receive from me, that ſhall he ſpeak; <hi>and he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> This affords an Argument to prove the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be God: He that can ſhew us things to come, he that clearly foreſeeth and infallibly foretelleth what ſhall be, before it is, is certainly God. But this the Holy Spirit doth; <hi>he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils may gueſs at things to come, but none can ſhew things to come, but he that is truly and really God; therefore the Spirit is ſo.</p>
               <p n="14">14 He ſhall glorifie me: for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you. 15 All things that the Father hath, are mine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid I, that he ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</p>
               <p>Here Chriſt ſhews the Advantage which would redound to himſelf by the coming of the Comforter; he declares that the Spirit ſhould glorifie him by his Teſtimony, Gifts, and Miracles, and ſhall in all things accord with him, and thereby evidence that he hath his Miſſion from him: <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> And <hi>all things that the Father hath are mine. Hence learn,</hi> That although the Union in Eſſence amongſt the Perſons in the Trinity is the ſame, yet the Order of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and Operation is diſtinct; the Son being from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son. <hi>For all things that the Father hath, are mine: And the Spirit ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me: and again, a little while and ye ſhall ſee me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I go to the Father. 17 Then ſaid <hi>ſome</hi> of his diſciples among themſelves, What is this that he ſaith unto us, A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me: and again, a little while and ye ſhall ſee me: and, Becauſe I go to the Father? 18 They ſaid therefore, What is this that he ſaith, A little while? we cannot tell what he ſaith. 19 Now Jeſus knew that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb facs="tcp:46556:157"/> to ask him, and ſaid unto them, Do ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire among your ſelves of that I ſaid, A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me: and again, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while and ye ſhall ſee me? 20 Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verily I ſay unto you, that ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoyce: and ye ſhall be ſorrowful, but your ſorrow ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into joy. 21 A woman when ſhe is in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, hath ſorrow, becauſe her hour is come: but aſſoon as ſhe is delivered of the child, ſhe remembreth no more the anguiſh, for joy that a man is born into the world. 22 And ye now therefore have ſorrow: but I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
               <p>In theſe Words our Holy Lord proceeds to comfort his Diſciples with a Promiſe, That, however, he was now to be removed from them, yet they ſhould ſhortly ſee him again; <hi>namely,</hi> after his Reſurrection; it being impoſſible that he ſhould be held by Death, but muſt ariſe and go to his Father. His Diſciples not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he meant, but labouring under the Prejudices of their national Errors, concerning the Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſias, knew not what to make of thoſe Words, <hi>A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me.</hi> Our Saviour therefore explains himſelf to his Diſciples, telling them that they ſhall have a time of ſad ſorrow and grief of Heart, during the time of his ſuffering and abſence from them, but their Sadneſs ſhould ſoon be turned into Joy, when they ſhall ſee him alive again after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This he illuſtrates by the Similitude of a travailing Woman, who ſoon forgets her Sorrow after ſhe has brought forth a Child. Thus will their Hearts revive upon the ſight of him riſen from the Grave, and no Man ſhall be able to take their Joy away from them, becauſe he ſhall die no more, but go to Heaven, and there live for ever, to make Interceſſion for them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. From the Apoſtles not underſtanding Chriſt's Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Departure, tho' ſo often inculcated upon them, <hi>A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me, becauſe I go to the Father. Hence Note,</hi> How unreaſonable it is to arrogate to Man's underſtanding a Power to comprehend Spiritual Myſteries, yea, to underſtand the plaineſt Truths, till Chriſt enlightens the Underſtanding; let the Doctrine be delivered never ſo plainly, and repeated never ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, yet will Men continue ignorant without Divine Illumination. How often had this plain Doctrine of Chriſt's departure to the Father, been preached to the Diſciples by Chriſt's own Mouth, yet ſtill they ſay, <hi>What is this he ſaith? We cannot tell what he ſaith. Learn,</hi> 2. From the different Effects which Chriſt's abſence ſhould have upon the World, and upon his Diſciples: <hi>The World will rejoyce, but ye ſhall weep and lament. Note,</hi> 1. That it is the wretched Diſpoſition of the World to rejoyce in the abſence and want of Chriſt out of the World: When I am gone, <hi>the World will rejoyce.</hi> 2. That nothing is the cauſe of ſo much Sorrow and Sadneſs to ſincere Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as Chriſt's abſence and removal from them: Such is their Eſtimation of the worth of him, ſo great is their Apprehenſion of the want of him, that there is no loſs comparable to his abſence and removal from them; ye ſhall weep and lament at my departure, tho' the World will rejoyce. <hi>Learn,</hi> 3. That the Believers Sorrow for Chriſt's abſence, tho' it be very great, yet it ſhall not be perpetual. <hi>Ye have now ſorrow; but I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man take from you.</hi> The Joy of the Saints may be interrupted, it ſhall never be totally extinguiſhed, it is a permanent Joy, of which they ſhall never be totally deprived, till they enter into the Ocean of eternal Joy. <hi>Your Joy no Man taketh from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 And in that day ye ſhall ask me nothing: Verily verily I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. 24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
               <p>At the firſt reading of the 23d Verſe there ſeems to be a contradiction in the words. Chriſt tells them in the former part of the Verſe, That they ſhall ask him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that Day, and yet promiſes that whatever they ask ſhall be given them, in the latter part of the Verſe. To reſolve this, know that there is a twofold asking one by way of Queſtion, the other by way of Petition. The former is asking that we may know, or be informed in what we doubt, the latter is asking that we may receive, and be ſupplied with what we want; now when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>In that day ye ſhall ask me nothing;</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid, at preſent you underſtand but little of the Myſteries of Religion, and therefore ye put Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about many things. But in that Day when the Comforter comes, ye ſhall be ſo clearly inlightned by him, that ye ſhall not need to ask me any more Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whatever ye ask the Father in my name, he will give it.</hi> The meaning is, In that day when I have left the World, and aſcended to my Father, you ſhall not need to addreſs your Prayers to me, but to my Father in my name. But what is it <hi>to pray in the name of Chriſt?</hi> Anſwer, It is more than to name Chriſt in Prayer; it is eaſie to name Chriſt in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but no eaſie thing to pray in the name of Chriſt. To pray in the name of Chriſt, is, 1. To look up to Chriſt, as having purchaſed for us this Priviledge, that we may pray; for it is by the Blood of Chriſt that we draw near to God, and that a Throne of Grace is open for us. 2. To pray in the name of Chriſt, is to pray in the ſtrength of Chriſt, by the aſſiſtance of his Grace, and the help of his Holy Spirit. 3. To pray in the name of Chriſt, is to pray by Faith in the Virtue of Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and Interceſſion, believing that what we ask on Earth, he interceeds for and obtains in Heaven. To pray thus; is no eaſie matter, and unleſs we do pray thus, we do not pray at all.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name:</p>
               <p>That is, explicitely and expreſly in my name, for the Saints of God under the Old Teſtament, and the Apoſtles themſelves under the New, had hitherto put up all their Petitions in the name of the Meſſiah; tho' not in the name of Jeſus. But now he exhorts them to Eye his Mediatory Office, in all their Addreſſes to God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes them that whatſoever he had purchaſed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Sufferings and Satisfaction; they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, for the ſake of his prevailing Interceſſion. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is a mighty encouragement to Prayer, that now under the Goſpel, the perſon of the Mediatour is exhibited in our Fleſh, has ſatisfied Divine Juſtice in in our Nature, and in that Nature interceeds as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, for whatever he purchaſed as our Surety. Hence is the encouragement, <hi>Whatever ye ask the Father in my name he will give it you.</hi>

               <p n="25">25 Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you in proverbs: the time cometh when I ſhall no more ſpeak unto you in proverbs, but I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Father.</p>
               <p>Here our Saviour tells his Diſciples, That although he had ſpoken many things to them in dark Parables, and figurative Expreſſions; yet now the time was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Namely,</hi> The Comforter's coming, when he would by the Holy Ghoſt clearly inlighten their Underſtandings in the Knowledg of Divine Myſteries, and the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Kingdom of God, and particularly in the Knowledge of God as his Father, and their Father in him. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That the cleareſt Truths will be but Parables, Proverbs, and dark Myſteries, even to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples themſelves, till the Holy Spirit inlightens their Underſtandings. 2. That the clear and full manifeſtation of Divine Truth was reſerved till the coming of the Comforter, who did communicate it to the Apoſtles, and by them to the Church or Body of Chriſtians. <hi>I,</hi> by him, <hi>will ſhew you plainly of the Father.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:158"/>26 At that day ye ſhall ask in my name: and I ſay not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: 27 For the Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At that day ſhall ye ask in my name,</hi> that is, after I am Aſcended into Heaven, and have ſent down the Holy Ghoſt upon you; ye ſhall put up all your Prayers and requeſts to God in my name. <hi>And I ſay not that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> That is, I need not tell you (tho' I ſhall certainly do it) that I will interceed with the Father for you; for he of himſelf is kindly diſpoſed, and affected towards you for my ſake. When Chriſt ſays, <hi>I do not ſay that I will pray the Father for you;</hi> the meaning is not, that he will lay aſide his Office as Interceſſour for Believers; but that they had not only his Interceſſion, but the Father's Love upon which to ground their hope of Audience. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Chriſtians Prayers put up in Chriſt's name cannot fail of Audience and Acceptance, for the ſake of the Mediatour's Interceſſion and the Father's Love. 2. That in our Prayers we ought ſo to eye and look up to Chriſt's Interceſſion, as not to over-look or forget the Father's Love; but ground our hopes of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon both. <hi>I ſay not that I will pray the Father for you,</hi> tho' I ſhall aſsuredly do it, <hi>for the Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me.</hi>

               <p>In the foregoing Verſe, the Apoſtles made a full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith in Chriſt's Divinity, and in Chriſt's Omniſciency. <hi>Now are we ſure that thou knoweſt all things, and that thou cameſt forth from God.</hi> In this Verſe, Chriſt intimates to them that their Faith ſhould be put upon a great Tryal very ſhortly; <hi>Namely,</hi> when his Sufferings came on, and that then they ſhould all forſake him, and take care of themſelves. <hi>Ye ſhall be ſcattered and leave me alone.

That when the Diſciples left Chriſt they were ſcattered every one to his own. 3. That when all forſook Chriſt and left him alone, he was far from being ſimply alone, becauſe God was with him. <hi>Ye ſhall leave me alone, and yet am I not alone, becauſe the Father is with me.</hi> God was with Chriſt; and will be with Chriſtians in a Suffering hour, in his Eſſential pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, in his Gracious and ſupporting preſence. <hi>He that ſent me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is with me, the Father hath not left me alone, for I do always thoſe things that pleaſe my Father.</hi>

               <p>Theſe words are the Concluſion of our Saviour's fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Sermon to his Diſciples, in which he declares to them, 1. The inevitable neceſſity of the World's Trouble. In the World ye ſhall have Tribulation; that is, while ye have to do with the Men of the World, while you have any thing to do with the things of the World; nay while you have a being in the World, you muſt look for Trouble, both from within and from without, from Friends and Foes, in Body, Soul, Name, Eſtate, Heart-breaking Troubles, Soul-rending Troubles; ſuch Troubles as will make the Heart to break, and the Back to bend; and you my Diſciples muſt expect it as well as others. <hi>In the World ye ſhall have Tribulation.

That is, all things in the World which may hinder his Peoples Comfort and Conſolation here, and their Eternal Happineſs and Salvation hereafter. As, <hi>Namely,</hi> the Prince of the World, the Rulers of the World, the wicked Men of the World, the Troubles of the World, the Temptations of the World, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that are in the World through Luſt. Now Chriſt having overcome the World, all perſons and things in it are at his diſpoſal, and can do nothing but by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and as he has overcome the World himſelf, ſo he will enable us through Faith in him to overcome it alſo. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is the victory over the World, even our Faith.</hi>

               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour having ended his Conſolatory and Valedictory Sermon, contained in the Three foregoing Chapters, in this Chapter we have Recorded his laſt Prayer, with, and for his Diſciples before he left the World; which is a Copy left upon Earth, of what he doth now interceed for, as an Advocate in Heaven. It is good (ſaith one) to compare Scripture with Scripture, but not to prefer Scripture before Scripture; all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being written by Inſpiration of God; but if any part of Scripture be to be magnified above another, this
<pb facs="tcp:46556:158"/> Chapter claims the preheminence; it contains the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things out of Chriſt's Soul for his Church and Children before his Departure; not for his Diſciples only, but for the ſucceeding Church to the end of the World. In the Verſe before us, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The order of our Saviour's Prayer. <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus;</hi> that is, after he had fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed his Excellent Sermon, he cloſes the Exerciſe with a moſt fervent and affectionate Prayer; teaching his Miniſters by his Example, to add Solemn Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to all their Inſtructions and Exhortations; if every Creature of God be to be Sanctified by Prayer, much more the word of God, which works not as a Natural Agent; but as a moral Inſtrument in God's hand. Now as God ſets the Word on work, ſo it is Prayer that ſets God on work. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. As the order of Chriſt's Prayer, ſo the geſture in which he prayed, <hi>He lifted up his Eyes to Heaven,</hi> as an indication of his Souls being lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to God in Heaven; to ſignifie his Reverence of God, whoſe Throne is in Heaven; and to denote his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, and raiſed expectation of aid and help from God, and not from any Creature. <hi>Learn,</hi> That the geſtures which we uſe in Prayer ſhould be ſuch, as may beſt expreſs our Reverence of God, and denote our Affiance and Truſt in him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Perſon prayed to, God, under the Appellation of a Father, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates a ſweet Relation; 'tis a word of endearing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and implies great Reverence towards God, and great confidence and truſt in him. <hi>Learn,</hi> It is very ſweet and comfortable in Prayer, when we can come and call God Father. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The Mercy prayed for, <hi>The hour is come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee; the hour is come;</hi> that is, the hour of my Sufferings, and thy Satisfaction, the hour of my Victory and of thy Glory; the hour, the ſad hour determined in thy decree and purpoſe; no calamity can touch us till God's hour is come, and when the ſad hour is come, the beſt remedy is Prayer; and the only perſon to fly unto for Succour is our Heavenly Father. <hi>Father, the hour is come,</hi> the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hour of my Death and Paſſion; <hi>Glorifie thy Son,</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him at his Death, by manifeſting him to have been the Son of God; Glorifie him in his Death, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as the Death of thy Son, for the Sins of the World; Glorifie him after his Death, by a ſpeedy Reſurrection from the Grave, and a Triumphant Exaltation at thy Right Hand. <hi>Here note,</hi> How the Glory of the Father and the Son are inſeparably link'd together; it was the Father's deſign to Glorifie the Son, and it was the Son's deſire to have Glory from the Father, for this end, that he might bring Glory to the Father. <hi>Glorifie thy Son, that thy Son may Glorifie thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Dignity which Chriſt was inveſted with; <hi>Power over all fleſh,</hi> that is, Authority to Judge and Sentence all Mankind. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How Chriſt came to be inveſted with this Power, it was given him by his Father; <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi> Hence the Socinians would infer, that he was not God, becauſe he received all from God; but the Text ſpeaks not of his Divine Power as God, but of his Power as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and the <hi>Note</hi> is, That all Mankind is under the Power and Authority of Jeſus Chriſt as Mediatour; he has a Legiſlative Power, or a Power to give Laws to all Mankind, and a Judiciary Power, or a Power to execute the Laws that he hath given. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The end for which Chriſt was inveſted with this Power. <hi>That he might give Eternal Life to as many as God had given him. Here Note,</hi> 1. That all Believers, that is, all ſincere and ſerious Chriſtians are given by God the Father unto Chriſt; they are given to him as his Charge, to Redeem, Sanctifie and Save, and as his Reward. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. 2. All that are given to Chriſt have Life from him, a Life of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sanctification on Earth, and a Life of Glory in Heaven. 3. The Life which Chriſt gives to them that are given him is Eternal Life. 4. That this Eternal Life is a free Gift from Chriſt unto his People, though they do not work for wages, yet they ſhall not work for nothing. <hi>I give unto them eternal Life.</hi> John 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</p>
               <p>That is, This is the way and means to obtain Eternal Life, <hi>Namely,</hi> By the true knowledge of God the Father, and of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour, who was commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and ſent by his Father to accompliſh the work of Redemption for a loſt World. <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> Chriſt calls God the Father the only true God, not in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Son and Holy Ghoſt; who being one in Eſſence with the Father, are truly and really God, as well as the Father; but in oppoſition to Idols and falſe Gods, there is a great difference betwixt theſe two Propoſitions, the Father is the only true God; and the Father only is true God: Chriſt ſaith, the former; <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know thee the only true God.</hi> The Socinian ſaith the latter. This is Life Eternal, to know only thee to be the true God; and that neither Jeſus Chriſt, nor the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are God, but the Father only. But how comes Eternal Life to depend as well upon the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, as of God the Father, if Jeſus Chriſt be only Man? and not truly and really God. For thus our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our affirms, this is Life Eternal to know thee and Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. That the beginning, encreaſe, and perfection of Eternal Life lyeth in Holy Knowledg. 2. That no Knowledg is ſufficient to Eternal Life; but the Knowledg of God and Jeſus Chriſt, who is alſo God; for who can think that the Knowledg of a mere Creature ſhould be accounted equally neceſſary to Salvation with the Knowledg of the Great and Mighty God? Surely if our Happineſs conſiſts equally in the Knowledg of God and Chriſt, then God and Chriſt are of the ſame Nature, equal in Power and Glory. The comprehenſive ſenſe of the words ſeems to be this; That the Knowledge of the only true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour, is the Life of Grace, and the neceſſary way to the Life of Glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I have glorified thee on the earth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the whole Life of Chriſt when here on Earth, it was a glorifying of his Father; he glorified his Father by the Doctrine which he preach'd, he glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Father by the Miracles which he wrought, he glorified his Father by the unſpotted Purity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of his Life, and by his unparallel'd Sufferings at his Death.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I have finiſhed the work which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me to do.</p>
               <p>That is, I am now about to finiſh it; he ſpeaks of what he was reſolv'd to do, as already done. <hi>Here Note,</hi> 1. That 'tis work that glorifies God. 2. That every Man has his work, his proper work aſſigned him by God. 3. This work muſt be finiſhed here upon Earth. 4. That when we have done our proportion of work, we may expect our portion of wages. 5. That it is a bleſſed thing at the hour of Death, to be able to ſay in ſincerity and uprightneſs, that we have glorified God in the World, and have finiſhed the work which he appointed us to do. <hi>Father, I have glorified thee on the Earth, and have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>
               <p>From the Connexion of this, with the foregoing Verſe. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That who ever expect to be glorified with God in Heaven, muſt glorifie him firſt here upon Earth. 2. That after we have glorified him, we may expect to be glorified with him and by him. <hi>I have glorified thee, now O Father glorifie thou me;</hi> it follows, <hi>with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was. Hence Note,</hi> 1. That Chriſt as God had an Eſſential Glory with God the Father before the World was, he had this Glory not in the purpoſe and decree of God only, as the Socinians would have it; for he doth not ſay, Glorifie me with the Glory which thou didſt purpoſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for me, before the World was; but <hi>which I had,</hi> and enjoyed with thee, <hi>before the World was;</hi> by which
<pb facs="tcp:46556:159"/> words our Lord plainly aſſerts his own Exiſtence and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Eternity, and prays for a Re-exaltation to that Glory which he enjoyed with his Father, before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. That Chriſt as Mediatour did ſo far humble himſelf, that he needed to pray to his Father, to beſtow upon him the Glory which he wanted; <hi>Namely,</hi> The Glory of his Aſcenſion and Exaltation. <hi>Now O Father glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word.</p>
               <p>By the name of God, we are here to underſtand his Nature, his Properties and Attributes, his Deſigns and Counſels for the Salvation of Mankind; Chriſt as the Prophet of his Church, made all theſe known unto his People. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt has made a full and compleat Diſcovery of his Father's Mind and Will unto his People. <hi>I have manifeſted thy name, unto them which thou gaveſt me, thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word Learn,</hi> 1. That all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are given unto Chriſt, as his Purchaſe and as his Charge. They are given him as his Subjects, as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; as the Wife of his Boſom, as the Members of his Body. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That none are given to Chriſt, but thoſe that were firſt the Fathers. <hi>Thine they were and thou gaveſt them me. Learn,</hi> 3. That all thoſe that are given unto Chriſt do keep his word; they keep it in their underſtandings, they hide it in their Hearts, they feel the force of it in their Souls, they expreſs the power of it in their Lives. <hi>They have kept thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me, are of thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The faithfulneſs of Chriſt in revealing the whole Will of his Father to his Diſciples. 2. The proficiency of the Diſciples in the School of Chriſt; they knew all the things which Chriſt had told them. <hi>Namely,</hi> That whatſoever he had, it was given him of the Father, and that he had theſe things from him to be a Mediatour. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt hath approved himſelf a faithful Prophet to his Church, a faithful Meſſenger from his Father to his People; in that he hath added nothing to his Meſſage, nor taken nothing from it. 2. That it is our duty to know and believe on Chriſt, as the only Meſſenger and Mediatour ſent of God. <hi>Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me, are of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me; and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</p>
               <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, The Meſſage by thee my Father, committed to me, I have communicated to them my Diſciples, and they have received it, and will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it from thee to the World; being ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that my coming and preaching was all by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from thee. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which was revealed by Chriſt, was received from the Father. 2. That Faith is a receiving of the word of Chriſt, and of Chriſt in and by the word. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is a relative term, and preſuppoſes an offer. God offers on his part, we receive on our part, the whole word with the whole heart. 3. That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to preach that and only that which they have out of the word of God. <hi>I have given them the word which thou gaveſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</p>
               <p>That is, I now offer up a Prayer particularly, 1. For my Apoſtles, deſigned to ſo great a work as the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Everlaſting Goſpel, to the obſtinate <hi>Jews</hi> and obdurate <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 2. I interceed alſo for all Believers at this time, for their perſeverance in the Faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Perſecution; but I do not now interceed for the wicked and impenitent World, they not being capable (whilſt ſuch) of theſe Mercies and Bleſſings; though at other times we find him praying for the World, yea for his very Crucifiers. Father forgive them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay in this very Prayer, at the 20th Verſe, he Prays for the World; that is, for the Gentile World; all thoſe that by the preaching of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors ſhould be brought to Believe on him to the End of the World. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Great and Gracious Interceſſour. 2. That all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, all the Children of God in general are under the fruit and benefit of Chriſt's Interceſſion. 3. That as all the Members of Chriſt in general, ſo the Miniſters and Ambaſſadours of Chriſt in ſpecial, have a peculiar intereſt in Chriſt's Interceſſion; and great are the Advantages of His Interceſſion for them. 1. From the perſon interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt, conſider the Dignity of his Perſon, God Man; the dearneſs of his Perſon, God's Son. 2. From the manner of his Interceſſion, not by way of entreaty, but meritorious claim. 3. From the ſublimity of the Office, our Interceſſor is near to God, even at his Right Hand. 4. From the Fruits of his Interceſſion, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Acceptance and Juſtification of our Perſons, the hearing and anſwering of our Prayers, the pardon and forgiveneſs of our Sins, our preſervation in Grace, and our hopes of Eternal Glory.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</p>
               <p>We may underſtand this two ways, 1. Of all Perſons, all my Friends, all my Diſciples are thine, as well as mine. <hi>Thence learn,</hi> That the Father and the Son have a like Share and Propriety in all Believers. 2. The words in the Original, being of the Neuter Gender, ſignifie all thy things are mine, and all my things are thine; Chriſt and his Father are one, and they agree in one; they have the ſame Eſſence and Nature, the ſame Attributes and Will; Chriſt hath all things that the Father hath, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things that the Father willeth, and doth all things that the Father doth; he is therefore really and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally God. It followeth, <hi>and I am glorified in them;</hi> that is, I am made glorious by their owning and receiving me, by their believing in me, and accepting of me for their Lord and Saviour. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is eminently glorified in, and by, all thoſe that believe in him and belong unto him.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I come to thee. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, keep through thine own name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one, as we <hi>are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. Our Saviour's preſent Condition; <hi>I am no more in the World;</hi> that is, I ſhall continue on Earth but a ſmall time longer, and then aſcend to my Father in Heaven. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt, as he is Man, is gone out of this lower World into the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Preſence of his Father: He had been abaſed before, he muſt be exalted now: He had no more Work to do on Earth, but much to do in Heaven; therefore he left this Earth to go to Heaven. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Saviour's Prayer to his Father for his Apoſtles before he left the World. <hi>Holy Father, keep them;</hi> that is, preſerve them by thy Divine Power and Goodneſs, for the Glory of thy Holy Name. <hi>Here Note,</hi> 1. The Title and Appellation given to God; <hi>Holy Father. Thence Learn,</hi> That when we go to God in Prayer, eſpecially for Grace and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we muſt look upon him as an Holy Father, as eſſentially and originally Holy, as infinitely and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently Holy. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. The Supplication requeſted of God: <hi>Keep through thy name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me. Thence Learn,</hi> That the Perſeverance of the Saints in a ſtate of Grace, is the ſweet Effect and Fruit of Chriſt's Prayer: Chriſt has begged it, and it cannot be denied, there being ſuch an Harmony and ſweet Conſent betwixt the Will of the Father and the Will of the Son. Three things concur to the Believer's Perſeverance. On the Father's Part, there is everlaſting Love and all-ſufficient
<pb facs="tcp:46556:159"/> Power. On the Son's Part, there is everlaſting Merit and conſtant Interceſſion. On the Spirit's Part, there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Inhabitation and continued Influence. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The End of Chriſt's Supplication on behalf of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>that they may be one, as we are one. Here Note,</hi> 1. That the Heart of Chriſt is exceedingly ſet upon the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Oneneſs of his Members. 2. That the Believers Union with Chriſt, their Head, and one with another, has ſome reſemblance to that Unity that is betwixt the Father and the Son. For 'tis an holy and ſpiritual Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a cloſe and intimate Union, an indiſſoluble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Union.</p>
               <p n="12">12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition: that the ſcripture might be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That thoſe which ſhall be ſaved, are given unto Chriſt and committed to his Care and Truſt. 2. That none of thoſe that are given unto Chriſt, as his Charge, and committed to his Care and Truſt, ſhall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt. <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> It follows, <hi>but the Son of Perdition.</hi> A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be ſaid to be a Son of Perdition two ways: Actively and Paſſively. Actively, he is ſo, who makes it his Work and Buſineſs to deſtroy others. Paſſively, he is a Son of Perdition, who for his Wickedneſs in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others is deſtroyed himſelf. <hi>Judas</hi> was a Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in both theſe Senſes; his Heart was maliciouſly ſet upon deſtroying Chriſt, and wilfully ſet upon his own deſtruction: His Covetouſneſs and Hypocriſie prompted him to betray our Saviour, his Deſpair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to deſtroy himſelf.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And now come I to thee, and theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</p>
               <p>In theſe Words our Saviour declares the great Reaſon why he did at this time ſo publickly and ſolemnly pray for his Diſciples; it was to fill them with Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that their Joy might not be diminiſhed by Chriſt's departure, but rather encreaſed by the coming of the Comforter. <hi>That they may have my Joy fulfilled in them;</hi> that is, the Joy which they take in me, and the Joy which they have from me: There is a double Care which Chriſt takes of his People, <hi>namely,</hi> a Care of their Graces, and a Care of their Joy and Comfort: How ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous was he to leave his Diſciples joyful before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them! He delights to ſee his People chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and he knows of what great Uſe ſpiritual Joy is in the Chriſtian's Courſe, both to enable us for Doing, and to fit us for Suffering. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That Chriſt is the Author and Original of the Joy of his People. <hi>My Joy.</hi> 2. That it is Chriſt's Will and Deſire that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be full of holy Joy. <hi>That my Joy may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them.</hi> 3. That the great End of Chriſt's Prayer and Interceſſion was and is, that his Peoples Hearts might be full of Joy. <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak in the World, that they might have my Joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have given them thy Word;</hi> partly by external Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and partly by internal Illumination; and for thy Word ſake <hi>the World hates them,</hi> as alſo <hi>becauſe they are not of the World. Learn,</hi> 1. That Chriſtians, eſpecially Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to whom Chriſt has given his Word, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the World's hatred. Few of the Prophets or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles died a natural death: As their Calling is Eminent, ſo muſt their Sufferings be Exemplary. The beſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the beſt Men, are uſually moſt hated. There is an Antipathy againſt the Power of Godlineſs, or a cruel, cauſeleſs, implacable and irreconcilable hatred againſt the Saints, becauſe of their ſtrictneſs in Religion, and contrariety to the World. 2. That it is the Honour of Believers, that they are like unto Chriſt, in being the Objects of the World's hatred. <hi>The World hates them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not of the World, as I am not of the World.</hi> This Chriſt adds both for Information and Conſolation; for Information, that they ſhould look for ſuch Hatred, Miſery and Trouble as they ſaw him grapple with; and for Conſolation, to think that the World can never hate us ſo bad as it hated Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="15">15 I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil. 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. That the Wiſdom of Chriſt ſees it fit to continue his Children and People in the World, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Perils and Dangers of the World: He has Work for them, and they are of Uſe to him, for a time, in the World; and till their Work be done, Chriſt's Love will not; and the World's Malice cannot remove them hence. Yet Chriſt prays that his Father would keep them from the Evil; that is, from the Sins, Temptations and Snares of this wicked World. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> That a ſpiritual Victory over Evil, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a total exemption from Evil; it is a far greater Mercy to be kept from ſin in our Afflictions, than from the Afflictions themſelves.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p>
               <p>Sanctifie them not initially, for ſo they were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied already, but progreſſively let them increaſe more and more in Grace and Holineſs. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That ſuch as are already ſanctified, muſt labour and ought to endeavour after further Meaſures and higher Degrees of Sanctification. The moſt Holy may yet be more Holy. 2. That the Word of God is the great Inſtrument in God's Hand for his Peoples Sanctification. 3. That the Word of God is the Truth of God: <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</hi> The Word of God is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, an Eternal Truth, an Infallible Truth, an Holy Truth.</p>
               <p n="18">18 As thou haſt ſent me into the world, even ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Chriſt's Miſſion: The Father ſent him into the World. Chriſt's ſending implies the Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Perſon, his Qualification for the Work, his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commiſſion. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not of himſelf undertake the Office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but was ſent; that is, authorized and Commiſſioned of God ſo to do. <hi>Thou haſt ſent me into the World. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. As Chriſt's Miſſion, ſo the Apoſtles Miſſion: <hi>As thou haſt ſent me, ſo have I ſent them. Learn thence,</hi> That none may or ought to undertake the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry without an Authoritative ſending from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; not immediately and extraordinarily by Voice or Viſion, but mediately by the Officers of the Church. And ſuch as are ſo ſent, are ſent by Chriſt himſelf; and if ſo, it is the Peoples Duty to reverence their Perſons, to reſpect their Office, to receive their Meſſage. <hi>As thou haſt ſent me, ſo have I ſent them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Sanctifie</hi> here is not to be taken for the Cleanſing, Purifying, or making Holy that which before was Unclean: But Chriſt's ſanctifying himſelf imports, 1. His ſeparation, or ſetting himſelf apart to be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin. 2. His Conſecration or Dedication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this Holy Uſe and Service. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did dedicate and ſolemnly ſet himſelf apart to the great Work and Office of a Mediator. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the great End for which Chriſt did thus ſanctifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it was that he might ſanctifie his Members; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he conſecrate and ſet himſelf apart for us, that we ſhould be conſecrated to, and wholly ſet apart for him.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word:</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:160"/>
               <p>Hitherto our Saviour had been praying for himſelf and his Apoſtles, now he prays for all Perſons, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſhould believe in him, throughout the World, by the preaching of the Goſpel. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> That all Believers have a ſpecial Intereſt in Chriſt's Prayer. 2. That in the Senſe of the Goſpel they are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are wrought upon to believe in Chriſt thro' the Word. 3. That ſuch is Chriſt's Care of, and Love to his own, that they were remembred by him in his Prayer, even before they had a Being. I pray not for them alone, <hi>but for all that ſhall believe in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 That they all may be one, as thou Father <hi>art</hi> in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</p>
               <p>The ſpecial Mercy and particular Bleſſing which Chriſt prays for on the behalf of Believers, is a cloſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Union betwixt the Father, Himſelf, and Them, and alſo betwixt one another; ſuch an Union as doth in ſome ſort reſemble that Union which is betwixt God and Chriſt; not an Unity of Eſſence and Nature, but of Wills and Affections. <hi>Hence Note,</hi> 1. That the myſtical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Chriſt and his Members, carrieth ſome reſemblance with that Union which is betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. 2. That Union amongſt the Miniſters and Members of Jeſus Chriſt, is of ſo great Importance, Neceſſity, and Conſequence, that he did in their behalf principally and chiefly pray for it. An Unity of Love and Affection, of Faith and Profeſſion, and Unity of Practice and Converſation, are Mercies which Chriſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly prayed for, and has dearly paid for; and nothing is more deſired by him now in Heaven, than that his Diſciples ſhould be One among themſelves here on Earth. <hi>Father, may they be one, as we are one: That the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Here Chriſt intimates one ſpecial Advantage that would redound to the World by this deſirable Union betwixt the Miniſters and Members of Chriſt, it will, if not Convert, yet at leaſt convince the World that I and my Doctrine came from God. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> That Union amongſt Chriſt's Diſciples, is one ſpecial means to enlarge the Kingdom of Chriſt, and to cauſe the World to have better thoughts of him and his Doctrine. <hi>By their being one, as we are one, the World will believe that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one.</p>

                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. Chriſt's Communication of that Glory to Believers, which he had received from the Father; that is, not his eſſential Glory, but his mediatorial Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>The Glory which thou gaveſt me.</hi> Now Chriſt hath no Glory given him as God, but much Glory beſtowed upon him as Mediatour. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The end of this Communication; why he gave his Diſciples that Glory, which the Father had given him. <hi>Namely,</hi> That <hi>they might be one. Learn,</hi> 1. That God the Father hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much Glory on Chriſt his Son, as he is Man and Mediatour of the Church. 2. That the ſame Glory for Kind and Subſtance, though not for Meaſure and Degree, which Chriſt as Mediatour has received from the Father, is communicated to true Believers. 3. That the great End of this Communication was and is, to oblige and enable his People to maintain a very ſtrict Union amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>The Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one.</hi> 4.

               <p n="23">23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That as the Father is in Chriſt, ſo is Chriſt in Believers, and they in him; the Father is in Chriſt in reſpect of his Divine Nature, Eſſence and Attributes, and Chriſt is in Believers, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of his Holy Spirit. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That the Believers happineſs conſiſteth in their oneneſs, in being one with God through Chriſt and one amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>That they may be made perfect in one. Obſerve,</hi> 3. That God the Father loveth Chriſt his Son; <hi>Thou loveſt them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> God loveth Chriſt, firſt as God, ſo he is <hi>Primum Amabile,</hi> the firſt object of his Love, as repreſenting his Attributes exactly. Secondly as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. <hi>John</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my Life for my Sheep. Obſerve,</hi> 4. That God the Father loves Believers, even as they loved Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that is, he loves them upon the ſame grounds that he loved him; <hi>Namely,</hi> For their nearneſs, and for their likeneſs to him. 1. For their nearneſs and relation to him, he loveth Chriſt as his Son, Believers as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father beſtoweth upon us, that we ſhould be call'd the Sons of God.</hi> 2. The properties of the Father's Love towards Chriſt and Believers are the ſame; Doth he Love Chriſt with a tender Love; with an unchangeable Love, with an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Love? ſo doth he Love Believers alſo. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 5. That Chriſt would have the World know that God the Father loveth the Children of Men, as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Chriſt is not ambitious to ingroſs all our Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, but would have the World take notice of the good Will of his Father as well as of himſelf, to loſt Mankind, of the Father's Love in ſending him, as well as of his own Love in coming. <hi>That the World may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me: for thou lovedſt me before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour had prayed for his Diſciples Sanctification before, here he Prays for their Glorification. 1. <hi>That they may be where he is;</hi> now Chriſt is with them, in his Ordinances, in his Word, and at his Table, ere long they ſhall be with him, as his Friends, as his Spouſe, as his Companions in his Kingdom. 2. That they may be <hi>with him</hi> where he is; this is more than the former; a Blind Man may be where the Sun is, but not with the Sun; becauſe he doth not injoy the light and benefit of it: To be <hi>with Chriſt</hi> where he is, imports Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. 3. That being with him where he is, <hi>they may behold his glory;</hi> that is, ſo ſee it, as everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to poſſeſs and injoy it. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That all thoſe that are given to Chriſt as his Charge, and as his Reward, ſhall certainly come to Heaven to him; Father, <hi>I will,</hi> that they be with me, becauſe I have merited that they ſhould be with me, I will that they behold my Glory, becauſe I have purchaſed it at ſo dear a rate. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That the work and imployment of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven chiefly conſiſts in ſeeing and injoying Chriſt's Glory; for it will be a poſſeſſive ſight, the language of every look will be, This Happineſs is mine, this Glory is mine. 3. That the top and height of the Saints happineſs in Heaven conſiſts in this, That they ſhall there be with Chriſt. <hi>Father, I will that they may be with me to behold my Glory.</hi>

               <p n="25">25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Appellation given to God. <hi>O Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father.</hi> This is the Sixth time that Chriſt in this Prayer has called God Father, it being ſo ſweet a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and producing all Love, Delight, Joy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, by him that practically improves it. <hi>But Obſerve,</hi> That at <hi>Verſe</hi> 11; When Chriſt prayed for his Peoples Sanctification, he ſaid, <hi>Holy Father;</hi> making uſe of that Attribute which is the cauſe of all Holineſs in the Creature; but now praying for their Glorification, he ſays, <hi>O Righteous Father,</hi> Righteous in making good thy promiſes both to me and them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. What it is that our Saviour affirms concerning the wicked and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving World, that they have not known God, <hi>the World hath not known thee;</hi> not as if the World had not known him at all, but not known him aright; the unbelieving
<pb facs="tcp:46556:160"/> and unſanctified part of the World have no ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, not living anſwerably to what they know to be their Duty. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. What Chriſt affirms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf; <hi>But I have known thee, and theſe have known thee.</hi> Intimating thus much unto us, That Jeſus Chriſt alone knows God immediately, and all others know him by the means of Chriſt; Chriſt is the Original and fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe of all the ſaving knowledg that Believers have of God. There is not the leaſt Ray of ſaving Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that doth not deſcend from Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare <hi>it:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, I have made known unto them thy Nature, Attributes, Counſels, Will and Commands; and I will continue the manifeſtation of the ſame to the End. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the ſaving knowledg of God was not attainable by natural Abilities; but cometh to us by the ſpecial Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I have declared unto them thy name. Learn,</hi> 2. That they that have the Name of God, his Nature and Will, ſavingly declared to them, do ſtand in need of farther declarations, and diſcoveries of God's Nature and Will to be made unto them. <hi>I have declared to them thy name, and I will declare it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</p>
               <p>That is, That the Love which is Originally in thy ſelf, as the fountain of all Grace may be communicated and diſpenſed from thee to them, and become inherent in them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That it is not enough for the People of God that they are beloved of him, and that his Love is towards them; but they muſt endeavour <hi>to have it in them;</hi> that is, experience it in the effects of it, and in the ſenſe and feeling of it in their own Souls. The ſafety of a Chriſtian lies in this, that God loves him, but the Joy, the Comfort, and Happineſs of a Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Knowledg, in the ſenſible Apprehenſion and feeling of this Love; therefore Chriſt cloſeth his Prayer for his Members, with this Affectionate and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Petition. <hi>Let the Love wherewith thou haſt loved me be in them, and I in them.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 VVHen Jeſus had ſpoken theſe words, he went forth with his diſciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which he entred, and his diſciples. 2 And Judas alſo which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jeſus oft-times reſorted thither with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had our dear Lord ended his Divine Prayer, Recorded in the foregoing Chapter, but he goes forth to meet his Sufferings, with a willing chearfulneſs. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires with his Diſciples into a Garden, not to hide and ſhelter himſelf from his Enemies; for if ſo, it had been the moſt improper place he could have choſen; it being the accuſtomed place where he was wont to Pray, and a place well known to <hi>Judas,</hi> who was now coming to ſeek him. <hi>Judas which betrayed him knew the place, for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus oft-times reſorted thither with his Diſciples.</hi> So that Chriſt repaired to this Garden not to ſhun, but to meet the Enemy, to offer himſelf as a prey to the Wolves; which in the Garden hunted him, and laid hold upon him; he alſo reſorted to this Garden now for privacy, that he might freely pour out his Soul to God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was praying to his Father in the Garden, when <hi>Judas</hi> with his Bla k-Guard came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Judas then having received a band <hi>of men,</hi> and Officers from the chief prieſts and Phariſees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. What a multitude were here imployed by the Chief Prieſts and Phariſees, for apprehending a ſingle Perſon, Gown-Men, and Sword-Men, Young and Old, Jew and Gentile; all ſorts of Perſons contriving his Death, as all Conditions of People were afterwards to receive Benefit by it. But what need theſe Lanthorns and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it being then as ſome obſerve Full-Moon, when they ſought him in the Garden? All this argued their zealous Induſtry for our Saviour's Apprehenſion, that they might be ſure to find him, in caſe he ſhould hide himſelf in any holes or corners of the Garden. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Perſecutors and wicked Apoſtates are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in their deſigns and actings, but very Vigilant and Active; when at the ſame time Chriſt's own Diſciples and Followers are aſleep and careleſs; how active is <hi>Judas,</hi> and how watchful was his Bloody Crew, even at that time when Chriſt's Diſciples could not keep their Eyes open!</p>
               <p n="4">4 Jeſus therefore knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth, and ſaid unto them, Whom ſeek ye? 5 They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, Jeſus of Nazareth. Jeſus ſaith unto them, I am <hi>he.</hi> And Judas alſo which betrayed him, ſtood with them. 6 Aſſoon then as he had ſaid unto them, I am <hi>he,</hi> they went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and fell to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How our Lord's Sufferings were all foreknown to himſelf, before they came upon him, and yet how willingly and chearfully did he go forth to meet them. Should our Sufferings be known unto us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come upon us, how would it diſquiet and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb us; yea, not only diſcompoſe us, but diſtract us; in great Wiſdom therefore, and in tender Mercy has God concealed future events from us; but it was otherwiſe with Chriſt; he had an exact Knowledg of thoſe bitter Sufferings which he was to undergo, and yet with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Mind he goes forth to meet them. <hi>Jeſus knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth.</hi> Lord! How endearing are our Obligations to thy ſelf, that when thou kneweſt before-hand the bitterneſs of that Cup which the Juſtice of God was about to put into thy hand, thou didſt not decline to Drink it off for our ſakes? <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That it was not Man's Power, but Chriſt's own Permiſſion, which brought his Sufferings upon him. How eaſily could Chriſt have delivered himſelf out of his Enemies hands, who with a word from his Mouth, cauſed them to go backward and fall to the Ground: Chriſt in ſpeaking thoſe words, did let out a little Ray or Beam of his Deity, and this ſtruck them down. O what fear will Chriſt ſend out when he cometh to judge the World; who could ſend forth ſuch a fear when he yielded up himſelf to be judged and condemned in the World! If there was ſo much Majeſty in the Voice of Chriſt, in one of the loweſt acts of his humiliation; What will the Voice of a Glorified Chriſt be to Sinners, when he ſhall come as a Judge to Condemn the World?</p>
               <p n="7">7 Then asked he them again, Whom ſeek ye? and they ſaid, Jeſus of Nazareth. 8 Jeſus anſwered, I have told you that I am <hi>he.</hi> If therefore ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way: 9 That the ſaying might be fulfilled which he ſpake, Of them which thou gaveſt me, have I loſt none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Note,</hi> 1. How voluntarily and freely Chriſt laid down his Life, when his Enemies were fallen to the Ground, he ſuffered them to riſe again, and offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, to take him and carry him away. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. How the ſight of this glorious Miracle of the Soldiers falling to the Ground, did not deterr or diſcourage them from their wicked purpoſe; they get up again and go on with their blody deſign. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That obſtinate and obdurate Sinners will not be reclaimed by the moſt evident and convincing, by the moſt miraculous and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing appearances of God againſt them. <hi>Note,</hi> 3. How mindful in the midſt of his Sufferings, Chriſt was of his dear Diſciples, to ſecure them, at this time, from Death and Danger. <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way.</hi> That is, my Diſciples, againſt whom you have no Warrant at
<pb facs="tcp:46556:161"/> this time <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt is ſo tender of his Followers, that he will not put them upon Trials, or call them forth to Sufferings till they are ripe and ready, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared for them. The Diſciples yet were weak and feeble, timerous and fearful: And Chriſt had much Work and Service for them to do in the World; <hi>name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to plant and propagate the Goſpel in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; he therefore reſolves not to loſe any one of them by Perſecution at this time: And thus was his Word ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; <hi>of them which thou gaveſt me, I have loſt none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 Then Simon Peter having a ſword, drew it, and ſmote the high prieſts ſervant, and cut off his right ear. The ſervants name was Malchus. 11 Then ſaid Jeſus unto Peter, Put up thy ſword into the ſheath:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Love unto, and Zeal for, his Lord and Maſter; in defence of whom he now draws his Sword: But why did he not rather draw upon <hi>Judas</hi> than upon <hi>Malchus?</hi> Poſſibly, becauſe tho' <hi>Judas</hi> was moſt faulty, yet <hi>Malchus</hi> might be moſt forward to carry off our Saviour. Oh how doth a pious Breaſt ſwell with Indignation at the ſight of any open Affront offered unto its Saviour! <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> The Rebuke which Chriſt gave St. <hi>Peter</hi> for what he did; tho' his Heart was ſincere, yet his Hand was raſh; good Intentions are no Warrant for irregular Actions: Chriſt will thank no Man for drawing a Sword in defence of him, without a Warrant and Commiſſion from him. To reſiſt a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magiſtrate, even in Chriſt's own Defence, is raſh Zeal, and diſcountenanced by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1. A Metaphorical Deſcription of Chriſt's Sufferings: They are a Cup put into his Hand to drink of, and that by his own Father: They are a Cup, and but a Cup; God will not over-charge his People; and this Cup is from the Hand of a Father, yea, from the Hand of our Father: <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me. Obſerve,</hi> 2. Our Lord's Reſolution to drink off this Cup, how bitter ſoever, being put to his Mouth by his Father's Hand. <hi>Shall I not drink it?</hi> That is, I will drink it. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That oft-times the Wiſdom of God is pleaſed to put a Cup, a very bitter Cup of Affliction into the Hand of thoſe to drink, whom he doth moſt ſincerely love. 2. That when God doth do ſo, it is their Duty to drink it with ſilence and ſubmiſſion. <hi>Shall I not drink it?</hi> That is, I will certainly drink it with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and reſignation.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Then the band, and the captain, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Jews took Jeſus, and bound him, 13 And led him away to Annas firſt (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, which was the high prieſt that ſame year.) 14 Now Caiaphas was he which gave counſel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man ſhould die for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> having made good this Promiſe to the Chief Prieſts, and delivered Jeſus a Priſoner bound into their Hands; thoſe Evening-Wolves no ſooner ſeize the Lamb of God, but they thirſt and long to ſuck his innocent Blood; yet, leſt it ſhould look like a down-right Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they allow him a Mock-Trial, and abuſe the Law by perverting it to Injuſtice and Bloodſhed. How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible is it for the greateſt Innocence and Vertue to protect from Slander and falſe Accuſation; and no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be ſo innocent or good, whom falſe Witneſs may not condemn.</p>
               <p n="15">15 ¶ And Simon Peter followed Jeſus, and <hi>ſo did</hi> another diſciple. That diſciple was known unto the high prieſt, and went in with Jeſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the palace of the high prieſt. 16 But Peter ſtood at the door without. Then went out that other diſciple which was known unto the high prieſt, and ſpake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. 17 Then ſaith the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou alſo <hi>one</hi> of this man's diſciples? He ſaith, I am not. 18 And the ſervants and officers ſtood there, who had made a fire of coals, (for it was cold) and they warmed themſelves: and Peter ſtood with them, and warmed himſelf. They ſaid therefore unto him, Art not thou alſo one of his diſciples? He denied it, and ſaid, I am not. One of the ſervants of the high prieſt, being his kinſman whoſe ear Peter had cut off, ſaith, Did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? Peter then denied again, and immediately the cock crew.</p>
               <p>All the four Evangeliſts give us an Account of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall in denying his Maſter. And therein we have <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,</hi> 1. The Sin it ſelf which he fell into, the Denial of Chriſt, and this back'd with an Oath; he ſware that he knew not the Man. Lord! how may the ſlaviſh fear of Suffering drive the holieſt and beſt of Men to commit the fouleſt and worſt of Sins! <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Fall. 1. His preſumptuous Confidence of his own ſtrength and ſtanding; <hi>though all Men forſake thee, yet will not I.</hi> Lord! to <hi>preſume</hi> upon our ſelves, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to <hi>provoke</hi> thee to leave us to our ſelves. If ever we ſtand in the Day of Trial, 'tis the fear of falling muſt enable us to ſtand; we ſoon fall, if we believe it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to fall. 2. His being in bad Company, amongſt Chriſt's Enemies; <hi>Peter</hi> had better have been a cold by himſelf alone, than warming himſelf at a Fire which was compaſſed in with the Blaſphemies of the Soldiers, where his Conſcience, tho' not ſeared, was yet made hard. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. The reiteration or repetition of this Sin, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Chriſt again and again; he denied him firſt with a Lye, then with an Oath and Curſe. Oh, how dangerous is it not to reſiſt the beginnings of Sin! If we yield to one Temptation, Satan will aſſault us with more, and ſtronger. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The heinous and aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sin. 1. From the Character of his Perſon, a Diſciple, an Apoſtle, a chief Apoſtle; yet he denies Chriſt. 2. From the Perſon whom he denies, his Maſter, his Saviour. 3. The Time when he denied him, ſoon after that Chriſt had waſh'd his Feet; yea, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had received the Sacrament from Chriſt's own Hand. How unreaſonable then is their Objection againſt coming to the Lord's-Table, That ſome. who go to it, diſhonour Chriſt as ſoon as they come from it? Such Examples ought not to diſcourage us from coming to the Ordinance, but ſhould excite and increaſe our watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs after we have been there, that our after-deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be ſuitable to the Solemnity of a Sacramental Table.</p>
               <p n="19">19 ¶ The high prieſt then asked Jeſus of his diſciples, and of his doctrine. 20 Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, I ſpake openly to the world; I ever taught in the ſynagogue, and in the temple, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jews always reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing. 21 Why askeſt thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have ſaid unto them: behold, they know what I ſaid.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour being brought before <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, he examines him concerning his Doctrine and his Diſciples, pretending him to be guilty of Hereſie in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Sedition, in gathering Diſciples and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Our Saviour anſwers, That as to his Doctrine, he had not delivered it in Holes and Corners, but had <hi>taught</hi> publickly <hi>in the Temple and Synagogues; and that in ſecret he had ſaid nothing;</hi> that is, nothing contrary to what he had delivered in Publick. Chriſt never willingly affected Corners, he taught openly, and propounded his Doctrine publickly and plainly to the World. A convincing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that both he and his Doctrine were of God. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. That it is not unuſual for the beſt of Doctrines to paſs under the odious name and imputation of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Chriſt's own Doctrine is here charged: <hi>The High
<pb facs="tcp:46556:161"/> Prieſt asked Jeſus of his Doctrine.</hi> 2. That the Miniſters of Chriſt, who have Truth on their ſide, may and ought to ſpeak boldly and openly. <hi>I ſpake openly to the World. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas nihil erubeſcit praeterquam abſcondi.</hi> Truth bluſhes at nothing, except at its being concealed. <hi>In ſecret,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>have I ſaid nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 And when he had thus ſpoken, one of the officers which ſtood by, ſtroke Jeſus with the palm of his hand, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the high prieſt ſo? 23 Jeſus anſwered him, If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil: but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me? 24 (Now An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas had ſent him bound unto Caiaphas the high prieſt.) 25 And Simon Peter ſtood and warmed himſelf: They ſaid therefore unto him, Art not thou alſo one of his diſciples? He denied it, and ſaid, I am not. 26 One of the ſervants of the high prieſt (being his kinſman whoſe ear Peter cut off) ſaith, Did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? 27 Peter then denied again, and immediately the cock crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How inſolently and injuriouſly an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer ſtrikes our Saviour in this Court of Judicature: <hi>One of the Officers ſtroke Jeſus with the Palms of his Hands.</hi> What had the Holy and Innocent Jeſus done, to deſerve theſe Buffettings? He only made uſe of the Liberty which their Law did allow him, which was not to accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to put them upon the Proof of thoſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were brought againſt him. But from this Inſtance of our Saviour's Sufferings we <hi>learn,</hi> That Chriſt did endure painful Buffettings, ignominious and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Uſage, even from Inferiour Servants; <hi>giving his Cheek to the Smiters,</hi> to teſtifie that Shame and reproachful Uſage which was deſerved by us, and to ſanctifie that Condition to us, when ever it is allotted for us. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The meek and gentle Reproof which the Lord Jeſus gives to this rude Officer, he doth not ſtrike him dead upon the Place, nor cauſe that Arm to wither which was ſtretched forth againſt the Lord's anointed; but only lets him know, there was no Reaſon for his ſtriking of him. <hi>Where Note,</hi> That tho' our Saviour doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, yet he vindicates himſelf, and defends himſelf both with Law and Reaſon: <hi>If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil: But if well, why ſmiteſt thou me? Note,</hi> 2. That when the Soldier had ſtruck Chriſt upon one Cheek, he did not turn to him the other alſo, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.39. Which evidently ſhews, that That Precept, <hi>if they ſmite thee on one Cheek, turn the other alſo,</hi> commands only this, That rather than take Revenge, we ſhould take a ſecond Injury. Chriſtians ought rather to ſuffer a double Wrong than to ſeek a private Revenge: Chriſtianity obliges us to bear many Injuries patiently, rather than to avenge one privately: But tho' it binds up our Hands from private Revenge, yet it doth not ſhut our Mouths from complaining to publick Authority. Chriſt's own Practice here, expounds the Precept elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.39. for he complains here of the Officers Injuſtice in ſmiting him before the Judicatory, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges the Man to bear witneſs of the Evil. <hi>Obſerve, Laſtly,</hi> How our Lord was not only buffetted, but bound and ſent bound from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate</hi> again: And all this on foot through the Streets of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> from one end of the City to the other; partly, to render his Paſſion more publick, being made a Gazing-ſtock to the World, and a Spectacle both to Angels and Men. And his condeſcending to go bound from one High Prieſt to another, and from one Tribunal to another, teaches his People what Delinquents they were before the Tribunal of God, and what they deſerved by reaſon of Sin; even a Sentence of eternal Condemnation at the Tribunal of the Juſt and Holy God.</p>

               <p>There were two Courts of Judicature which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour was brought before and condemned by. 1. The Eccleſiaſtical Court or Sanhedrim, in which the High Prieſt ſate as Judge: Here he was condemned to Death for Blaſphemy. 2. The Civil Court, or Judgment-Hall, where <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the Roman Governor ſate Judge, who becauſe he was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> they would not go into his Houſe, leſt they ſhould be defiled; for they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it a Legal Pollution to come into the Houſe of a <hi>Gentile. Where Obſerve,</hi> The notorious Hypocriſie of theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> they ſcruple the defiling of themſelves by coming near the Judgment-Hall where <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate, but make no ſcruple at all to defile themſelves with the guilt of that innocent Blood which <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhed. When Perſons are over-zealous for Cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nial Obſervations, they are oft-times too remiſs with reference to Moral Duties. They <hi>brought him to the Judgment-Hall, but they themſelves went not in, leſt they ſhould be defiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 Pilate then went out unto them, and ſaid, What accuſation bring you againſt this man? 30 They anſwered and ſaid unto him, If he were not a malefactour, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How <hi>Pilate</hi> humours theſe <hi>Jews</hi> in their Superſtition. They ſcruple to go into the Judgment-Hall to him; he therefore goes out to them, and demands what Accuſation they had againſt Chriſt. They charge him here only for being a Malefactor, or an evil Doer in the general; but elſewhere (<hi>Luke</hi> 23.) they particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly accuſe him, 1. <hi>For perverting the Nation.</hi> 2. <hi>For for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to pay Tribute to</hi> Caeſar. 3. <hi>For ſaying that he himſelf was Chriſt, a King.</hi> All of which was filthy Calumny; yet Chriſt underwent the Reproach of it without opening his Mouth: Teaching us, when we lie under Calumny and unjuſt Imputation, to imitate him, who opened not his Mouth, but committed his Caſe to him that judgeth uprightly.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Then ſaid Pilate unto them, Take ye him and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore ſaid unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 32 That the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus might be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> being now under the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> tho' they had a Power of Judging and Cenſuring Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in ſmaller Matters, yet not in capital Caſes; they could not pronounce a Sentence of Death upon any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſay ſome; they might and did, ſay others, puniſh Blaſphemers by ſtoning them to death; but then their Sentence was to be ratified by the Roman Power: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly here they had in their Eccleſiaſtical Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Chriſt for Blaſphemy; now they bring him to <hi>Pilate</hi> the Roman Governor to confirm the Sentence of Death. From hence it appears, that Chriſt was the true Meſſias, being ſent into the World when the Sceptre was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> according to that ancient Prophecy of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Sceptre ſhall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> now had no Power abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condemn any Man, or to put him death; but this Power the Roman Emperor reſerved to his own Deputy. This contributed towards the fulfilling of our Saviour's Words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.19. <hi>That he ſhould be delivered to the Gentiles, and ſhould be crucified:</hi> Which was not a Jewiſh but a Roman Puniſhment. Had the <hi>Jews</hi> put him to death, they had ſtoned him. But Chriſt was to be made a Curſe for us by hanging upon a Tree, and accordingly the <hi>Jews</hi> execute the Counſel of God, tho' they knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> not, by refuſing to put him to death themſelves. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> How willing Chriſt was to undergo a ſhameful, painful and accurſed Death, that he might teſtifie his Love unto, and procure a Bleſſing for his People. Thus <hi>the Saying of Jeſus was fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what Death he ſhould die.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:162"/>33 Then Pilate entred into the judgement-hall again, and called Jeſus, and ſaid unto him, Art thou thou the king of the Jews? 34 Jeſus anſwered him, Sayeſt thou this thing of thy ſelf, or did others tell it thee of me? 35 Pilate anſwered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the chief prieſts have delivered thee unto me: What haſt thou done? 36 Jeſus anſwered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</p>

The Wiſdom and Caution of our Saviour's Anſwer, he neither affirms nor denies; though whenever we ſpeak, we are bound to ſpeak the truth, yet we are not bound at all times to ſpeak the whole truth. Chriſt tells him therefore, That upon the ſuppoſition that he was King, yet his Kingdom was no Earthly but a Spiritual Kingdom; he was no Temporal King, to Rule over his Subjects with Temporal Power and Worldly Pomp; but a Spiritual King, in and, over his Church only, to order the Affairs and look after the Government thereof. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt as God, hath an Univerſal Kingdom of Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, even over the higheſt of Men; and as Mediatour hath a Spiritual Kingdom in and over his Church. 2. That it is a clear Evidence that Chriſt's Kingdom is Spiritual, in as much as it is not carried on by violence and force of Arms as worldly Kingdoms are, but by Spiritual means and methods. <hi>If my Kingdom were of this World, my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants would fight for me; but now is my Kingdom not from hence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Queſtion <hi>Pilate</hi> put to Chriſt, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> a moſt noble and important Queſtion, had it been put forth with an honeſt Heart, with a Mind fairly diſpoſed for Information and Satisfaction; but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Pilate</hi>'s enquiry was not ſerious; nay it is generally thought that <hi>Pilate</hi> ask'd this Queſtion in Scorn, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and Deriſion; for he ſtays not for our Lord's Anſwer, but as ſoon as he ſtartled this Query, went oft the Bench in haſte. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That this Queſtion, What is Truth? or how may we come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, is of unſpeakable uſe and importance, and a Queſtion whereon the whole frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion depends. Becauſe Truth is claimed by all Parties of Men, by all Profeſſors of Religion: Ask the different Parties, from the Old Gentleman at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the pooreſt Quaker and Muggletonian, <hi>where is Truth?</hi> and they will all tell you, they are in the poſſeſſion of it; every Sect has thus much of Popery with it, that the profeſſors of it, think themſelves Infallible, and every one cries out, <hi>Here is Truth.</hi> But God has given us a two-fold Light to ſearch for Truth by. <hi>Namely,</hi> The Light of Reaſon, and the Light of Scripture, and Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: The former <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> ſet up in our Breaſts by God, on purpoſe to diſcover Truth unto us; God allows us, yea injoyns us, the free and impartial uſe of our Underſtandings and Judgments, in order to the finding out of Divine Truth; but becauſe Nature's Light, or the Light of Natural Reaſon is not clear and bright enough to give us a proſpect of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Truths: for Nature and Reaſon can never dictate thoſe things which depend wholly upon God's free Grace and good Pleaſure; ſuch are the Doctrine of a Saviour and Redeemer, and the method of Man's Salvation by the Sufferings of the Son of God; it had been Blaſphemy once to have ſuppoſed ſuch things, had not God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in Scripture: Therefore the Second Standard of Divine Truth is the infallible Word of God. The Goſpel of Chriſt is the way and the Truth; <hi>Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and would Men be ruled and conducted by theſe unalterable Standards of Truth, <hi>namely,</hi> Right Reaſon, and Divine Revelation, they would eaſily agree in their Judgments, what is to be believed, and all Diſputes and Controverſies would vaniſh; right Reaſon and Inſpired Scripture are the beſt Judges of Controverſies; they being the fixed Standards and Meaſures of Divine Truth, can beſt Reſolve <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Queſtion here, and tell us <hi>What is Truth.

How unwilling, how very unwilling <hi>Pilate</hi> was to be the Inſtrument of our Saviour's Death: He came forth three ſeveral times, and tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he finds no fault in him, he bids them take him, and judg him according to their Law. <hi>Pilate</hi> a <hi>Pagan</hi> Abſolves Chriſt, whilſt the Hypocritical <hi>Jews</hi> that heard his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and ſaw his Miracles do Condemn him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. <hi>Pilate</hi> having abſolved Chriſt, <hi>I find no fault in him,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours next to Releaſe him, and takes occaſion from their Cuſtom of having a Priſoner releaſed to them at their Feaſt, to inſinuate his Deſire that they ſhould chuſe Chriſt. <hi>Ye have a cuſtom, that I releaſe unto you one at the Paſſover. Obſerve laſtly,</hi> How the <hi>Jews</hi> prefer, <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Robber, before the Holy and Innocent Jeſus. <hi>They all cried out, ſaying, not this Man but Barabbas.

<pb facs="tcp:46556:162"/> the Inſtrument of our Saviour's Death; it is very evident that he had a mind to Releaſe him, and it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Pilate</hi> was thus forward to Scourge Chriſt, hoping that the <hi>Jews</hi> would have been ſatisfied with this lighter Puniſhment, and ſo have diſmiſt him: From this inſtance we may gather, That Hypocrites within the pale of the Viſible Church, may be guilty of ſuch tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Acts of wickedneſs, as the Conſcience of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> may boggle at and proteſt againſt. <hi>Pilate</hi> a <hi>Pagan</hi> Abſolves Chriſt, and ſeeks to releaſe him: whilſt the Hypocritical <hi>Jews,</hi> who heard his Doctrine, and ſaw his Miracles, condemn him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>Pilate</hi> ſuffers himſelf to be overcome with the <hi>Jews</hi> importunity, and contrary to the light of his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience delivers the Holy and Innocent Jeſus, firſt to be Scourged and then Crucified. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That it is a vain Apology for Sin, when Perſons pretend that it was not committed with their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but at the inſtigation and importunity of others: for ſuch is the frame and Conſtitution of Man's Soul, that none can make him either wicked or miſerable without his own Conſent. <hi>Then Pilate took Jeſus and Scourged him.</hi>

               <p>The next part of our Saviour's Sufferings conſiſted of cruel mockings: Chriſt had owned himſelf to be the King of the <hi>Jews;</hi> that is, a Spiritual King, in and over his Church. But the <hi>Jews</hi> expecting that the Meſſiah ſhould have appeared in the Pomp of an Earthly Prince, and finding it to be quite otherwiſe in our Saviour, they look upon him as a Deceiver and Impoſtour; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Treat him as a Mock-King, with all the marks of Deriſion and Scorn; for firſt they put a Crown upon his Head, but a very Ignominious and Painful one, <hi>a Crown of Thorns.</hi> They put a Scepter in his Hand, but that of a Reed; a Robe of Scarlet, or Purple upon his Body, and then bowed their Knees unto him, as they were wont to do before their Princes; crying, Hail! King! Thus were all the marks of Scorn imaginable put upon our dear Redeemer; yet what they did in Jeſt, God permitted to be done in Earneſt; for all theſe things were enſigns and marks of Sovereignty, and Almighty God cauſed the Royal Dignity of his Son to ſhine forth even in the midſt of his greateſt Abaſement. Whence was all this Jearing and Sport? but to flout Majeſty? and why did the Son of God undergo all this Ignominy, Diſgrace and Shame? but to ſhew what was due unto us for our Sins; as alſo to give us an Example, to bear all the Scorn, Reproach and Shame imaginable, for the ſake of him; who for the Joy that was ſet before him deſpiſed the Shame, as well as indured the Croſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and ſaith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. 5 Then came Jeſus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith unto them, Behold the man. 6 When the chief prieſts therefore and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſaw him, they cried out, ſaying, Crucifie <hi>him,</hi> crucifie <hi>him.</hi> Pilate ſaith unto them, Take ye him, and crucifie <hi>him:</hi> for I find no fault in him.</p>

By his wearing a Crown of Thorns, he took away the bitterneſs of that Curſe, which our Sins brought upon the Earth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18.

The noble Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given of Chriſt's Innocency, by the mouth of Pilate, <hi>I find in him no fault at all;</hi> he doth not ſay, I find him not Guilty of what is laid to his Charge; but gives an univerſal Teſtimony of our Lord's Innocency. <hi>I find no fault at all in him.</hi> In ſpight of all Malice, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency ſhall find ſome Friends and Abettors. Rather than Chriſt ſhall want witneſſes, <hi>Pilate</hi>'s mouth ſhall be opened for his Juſtification; how fain would he have freed Jeſus, whom he found faultleſs. Our Lord found more Compaſſion from <hi>Pilate,</hi> an <hi>Heathen,</hi> than he did from them of his own Nation. <hi>Pilate</hi> would have ſaved him, but they cry out for his Blood: Hypocrites within the viſible Church may be guilty of ſuch monſtrous Acts of wickedneſs, as the Conſciences of <hi>Heathens,</hi> without the Church may boggle at and proteſt againſt. <hi>Pilate</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> pronounces Chriſt Innocent, whilſt the Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Jews,</hi> who had heard his Doctrine, and ſeen his Miracles do Condemn him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. Who influenced the main Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> to deſire <hi>Pilate</hi> to put Jeſus to Death; it was the Chief Prieſts and Elders, <hi>they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Multitude:</hi> Wo be to the Common People, when their Guides and Leaders are corrupt; and wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, much more if they follow their wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Counſels; the <hi>Jews</hi> here followed their Guides the Chief Prieſts; but it was to their own deſtruction, as well as their Leaders, <hi>when the Blind lead the Blind, both fall into the Ditch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 The Jews anſwered him, we have a law, and by our law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God. 8 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying, he was the more afraid; 9 And went again into the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-hall, and ſaith unto Jeſus, Whence art thou? But Jeſus gave him no anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How Ambitious the Chief Prieſts were that Chriſt ſhould Die under a colour of Law. <hi>We have a Law, and by that Law he ought to Die.</hi> The Law which they allude to, is the Law for putting falſe Prophets and Blaſphemers to Death; of which number they conclude Chriſt to be, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God, whereas he did not make himſelf ſo, or only pretend to be ſo, but really and indeed was ſo; <hi>to wit,</hi> the eternal Son of God. Such as are indeed Blaſphemers, and do Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themſelves what is proper to God only; by the Law of God they ought to be put to Death; but Chriſt was not Guilty of the Violation of that Law; for he was indeed the Son of God, and did not make himſelf ſo. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How full of fear the Conſcience of <hi>Pilate</hi> was, when the <hi>Jews</hi> told him that Jeſus made himſelf the Son of God; he was afraid to Condemn him, not knowing but that he might be ſome Divine and extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and conſequently might draw down Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his own head. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That ſerious thoughts of a Deity will ſtrike terror even into a natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, eſpecially when the Sinner is following a courſe which his own judgment cannot approve; when <hi>Pilate</hi> heard of Chriſt's being the Son of God he was afraid, knowing that what he had done to him was againſt his own Conſcience. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Queſtion <hi>Pilate</hi> puts to Chriſt upon this occaſion, Whence art thou? that is, what is thy Original, or Parentage? Art thou a Divine Perſon or not? our bleſſed Saviour being unwilling to obſtruct his own Sufferings, or to diſcover any thing that might hinder <hi>Pilate</hi> from proceeding againſt him, would give him no Anſwer; having before made a reaſonable and ſufficient Defence. Oh how ready was Chriſt to lay down his Life for Sinners, and how willing to pay that Ranſome for his People, which the Juſtice of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Then ſaith Pilate unto him, Speakeſt thou not unto me? knoweſt thou not that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe thee? 11 Jeſus anſwered, Thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he
<pb facs="tcp:46556:163"/> that delivered me unto thee hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. How offended <hi>Pilate</hi> was at Chriſt's ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and how unreaſonably he boaſts of his Power and Authority. <hi>Have not I Power to Crucifie thee, and Power to Releaſe thee?</hi> It is the great Sin and ſnare of Men in Power, to forget from whom they derive their Power, and to think that they may employ their Power as they pleaſe. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Piety and meekneſs of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Anſwer. <hi>Thou couldſt have no Power againſt me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given thee from above.</hi> That is, Thou haſt no Power over me, nor couldſt thou inflict any puniſhment upon me, were it not that my Father had in his great Wiſdom, Divine Counſel, and for glorious Ends permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſo to be. <hi>Learn,</hi> That Chriſt's being under the Power of any Man, how great and eminent ſoever, did flow from the peculiar Diſpenſation of God; who in his wiſe and wonderful Counſel ſo ordered it, and ordained it for the Redemption and Salvation of his People; he was above all Humane Power as God, and no ways ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Power, being a perfectly Innocent Man. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How Chriſt charges his Death more upon <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> than upon <hi>Pilate</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. They that delivered me unto thee, have the greater Sin.</hi> Not that <hi>Pilate</hi> was excuſed from Sin, in delivering Chriſt to be Crucified; he ſinned heinouſly in abuſing his Power; but <hi>Judas</hi> ſinned more in delivering him up to the Chief Prieſts, and the Chief Prieſts in delivering him up to <hi>Pilate,</hi> than <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf whom they made a Tool to ſerve their Malice and Revenge; they had better means of Knowledge than he, and ſo ſinned againſt more Light than he; and conſequently their Guilt was greater, and their Condemnation heavier than his. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the greater means of Light and Knowledge Perſons Sin againſt, the more aggravated is their Guilt, and the more heigthned will be their Condemnation. <hi>He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 And from thenceforth Pilate ſought to releaſe him: but the Jews cried out, ſaying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Ceſars friend: whoſoever maketh himſelf a king, ſpeaketh againſt Ceſar. 13 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying, he brought Jeſus forth, and ſat down in the judgment-ſeat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Still Obſerve,</hi> How unwilling <hi>Pilate</hi> was to put Chriſt to Death, Conſcience bids him ſpare, Popularity bids him Kill; how frequently and how fervently did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the Jews, till they make it a State-caſe, and Tacitly Accuſe him for a Traitour, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, if he releaſed him. <hi>If thou let this Man go, thou art not Ceſar's friend.</hi> When <hi>Pilate</hi> heard that, he delivers up the Innocent Jeſus to be Crucified. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Natural Conſciences of Men, and the Innate notions of Good and Evil, may carry Men on a great way in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that which is a bare-faced Iniquity; but at laſt, either fear or ſhame will over-rule, if there be not a Superiour and more noble Principle. Though <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Conſcience acquitted Chriſt, and his Mouth had declared that he found no fault at all in him; yet fear of <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s diſpleaſure, cauſes him to deliver up to Death, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and beſt of Men, againſt his Judgment and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>When Pilate heard that, he brought Jeſus forth unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 And it was the preparation of the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and about the ſixth hour: and he ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews, Behold your king. 15 But they cried out, Away with <hi>him,</hi> away with <hi>him,</hi> crucifie him. Pilate ſaith unto them, Shall I crucifie your king? The chief prieſts anſwered, We have no king but Ceſar. 16 Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered he him therefore unto them to be crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> How careful the Holy Ghoſt is to Record and ſet down the Time when <hi>Pilate</hi> gave Sentence againſt Chriſt: In general, it was on the Day of the preparation for the Paſſover; that is, the Day immediately before it, when they prepared every thing needful for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization; and in particular it was about the ſixth hour of that Day. St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls it the third hour, St. <hi>John</hi> the ſixth; but this is eaſily reconciled thus; the <hi>Jews</hi> divided the Day into four quarters, which they called hours; the firſt was called the third hour, which anſwers our ninth, the ſecond called the ſixth hour, anſwering our twelfth, the third called the ninth hour, anſwering our three in the Afternoon; the fourth called the twelfth hour, which was the time of their Retirement from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and beginning of the firſt Night watch: Now the whole time from the third hour to the ſixth; that is, from Nine to Twelve, was called the Third Hour, and the whole intervening time, from the Sixth to the Ninth; that is, from Twelve to Three, is called the Sixth Hour, and ſo of the reſt. Now when St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, it was about the Sixth Hour when Chriſt was condemned by <hi>Pilate,</hi> and led away to be Crucified, and St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays it was the Third Hour; we are to underſtand that St. <hi>Mark</hi> takes in the whole time of the Third Hour, from Nine to Twelve; and St. <hi>John</hi> ſaying it was about the ſixth Hour, implies that it was near Twelve; ſo that between the Hours of Nine and Twelve our Lord was Sentenced, and led away to his Croſs, about Twelve faſtned to his Croſs, upon which he hung till the Ninth Hour; that is, till about Three in the Afternoon, during which time, there was ſuch an Eclipſe of the Sun, as did occaſion dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over all the Earth. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> The great Love and Condeſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt in ſtooping ſo low, to have his Sufferings lengthned out upon our accounts, to expiate our Guilt which deſerveth Eternal Sufferings; that he might by his Example warn us to prepare for Trials of long continuance, and Sanctifie a ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Affliction to us. Behold the Son of God haraſſed all Night before he ſuffered, hurried from place to place, poſted backward and forward, from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> wearied, ſcourged, buffetted, crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Thorns, at laſt nailed to his Croſs, and hanging thereupon from about Twelve to Three, in exquiſit Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Body, and under the ſenſe of his Father's wrath in his Soul. Oh Lord! Thy kindneſs towards us is match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inimitable, never was Love like thine.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And they took Jeſus and led him away. 17 And he bearing his croſs, went forth into a place called <hi>the place</hi> of a ſcull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha. 18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either ſide one, and Jeſus in the midſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> 1. That it was a Cuſtom among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> to cauſe the Perſon condemned to crucifying, to carry his own Croſs; accordingly our Saviour bare his own Croſs part of the way, till fainting under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it, they laid it upon another, not out of Mercy but Malice, reſerving him for a more publick Death: They were loth he ſhould go away in a fainting Fit. But why could not Chriſt bear his own Croſs? who was able to bear the Sins of the whole World, when hanging upon the Croſs? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. Probably the <hi>Jews</hi> Malice provided for him a Croſs of extraordinary greatneſs, proportionable to the Crimes they charged him with. 2. He was much debilitated and weakned, with his long watching and ſweating the Night before. 3. The ſharp edges of the Croſs grating his late whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and galled Shoulders, might occaſion the freſh bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wounds, and his weakning thereby. 4. Hereby he gave the World a Demonſtration of the Truth of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; that he was in all things like unto us, with reſpect to his Humane Nature, and the common Infirmities of that Nature. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The Infamous Company which our Holy Lord ſuffered with, two Thieves; on either ſide, one, and himſelf in the midſt; it had been a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſparagement to our bleſſed Redeemer, to be ſorted with the beſt of Men; but to be numbred with the Scum of Mankind is ſuch an Indignity as confounds
<pb facs="tcp:46556:163"/> our Thoughts. This was deſigned by the <hi>Jews</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and diſgrace our Saviour the more, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World, that he was the greateſt of Offenders. But God over-ruled this, for fulfilling an Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie concerning the Meſſias, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. <hi>laſt. And he was numbered with the Tranſgreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the croſs. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. 20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jeſus was crucified, was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, <hi>and</hi> Greek, <hi>and</hi> Latine. 21 Then ſaid the chief prieſts of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The king of the Jews; but that he ſaid, I am king of the Jews. 22 Pilate anſwered, What I have written, I have written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Inſcription wrote by <hi>Pilate</hi> over our ſuffering Saviour; <hi>This is Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>the King of the</hi> Jews. It was the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> when they crucified a Malefactor, to publiſh the Cauſe of his Death in Capital Letters over his Head, that ſo the Equity of their Proceedings might more clearly appear to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now it is Obſervable, how wonderfully the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God over-ruled the Heart and Pen of <hi>Pilate</hi> to draw this Title, which was truly Honourable, and fix it to his Croſs. <hi>Pilate</hi> who was before his Judge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him Innocent, is now his Herald to proclaim his Glory. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the Regal Dignity of Chriſt was openly proclaimed by an Enemy, and that in the time of his greateſt Reproaches and Sufferings. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> without his own knowledge, did our Saviour an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piece of Service; he did that for Chriſt which none of his own Diſciples durſt do; not deſignedly, but from the ſpecial Over-ruling Providence of God. No Thanks to <hi>Pilate</hi> for all this. Becauſe the higheſt Services performed to Chriſt undeſignedly, ſhall neither be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted nor rewarded by God. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour to alter this: <hi>Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he ſaid, I am the King of the Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> thought it would be a diſgrace to them, that Chriſt ſhould be reported abroad to have been their King; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſire an alteration of the Writing: But <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> that wrote in Honour of Chriſt, ſtifly defends what he had done: To all their Importunity he returns this reſolute Anſwer, <hi>What I have written, I have written.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Conſtancy of <hi>Pilate</hi> at this time, muſt be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ſpecial Divine Providence. How wonderful was it, that he who before was as inconſtant as a Reed, ſhould now be as fixed as a Pillar of Braſs! Whence is this, but from the God of Spirits, moving upon his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to write, and to defend what was written? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God hath a Proſpect beyond the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all <hi>Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 ¶ Then the ſouldiers, when they had crucified Jeſus, took his garments (and made four parts, to every ſouldier a part) and alſo <hi>his</hi> coat: now the coat was without ſeam, woven from the top throughout. 24 They ſaid therefore among themſelves, Let us not rent it, but caſt lots for it, whoſe it ſhall be: that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, which ſaith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my veſture they did caſt lots. Theſe things therefore the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did.</p>
               <p>Here we have recorded our Saviour's Sufferings from the Soldiers, they ſtrip him of his Garments before they faſtned him to his Croſs, and divide thoſe Garments which could be parted amongſt them, and caſt Lots for his woven Coat which could not be divided. Little did theſe vile Soldiers think that they were now fulfilling a Scripture-Prophecy. Yet ſo it was, this Action of theirs being foretold, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.18. <hi>They part my Garments amongſt them, and caſt lots upon my Veſture.</hi> Not that the Propheſie made them do it, but was fulfilled by their doing of it. From hence we may gather, That Chriſt ſuffered naked upon the Croſs; as naked (ſay ſome) as he came into the World. We had made our ſelves naked to our ſhame, and Chriſt became naked to cover our ſhame. If ſenſible of our own Nakedneſs and Shame, we flee unto him by Faith, we ſhall be cloathed upon with Robes of Righteouſneſs and Garments of everlaſting Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="25">25 ¶ Now there ſtood by the croſs of Jeſus, his mother, and his mothers ſiſter, Mary <hi>the wife</hi> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jeſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the diſciple ſtanding by, whom he loved, he ſaith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy ſon. 27 Then ſaith he to the diſciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour that diſciple took her unto his own <hi>home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Words contain our Saviour's affectionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of his diſtreſſed Mother to the Care of a dear Diſciple. It was an Argument of Chriſt's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Love to her, that when he was nailed to the Croſs and ready to die, he was more concern'd for his Mothers Sorrows than for his own Sufferings. Now was <hi>Simeon</hi>'s Propheſie fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.35. <hi>A Sword ſhall paſs through thine own Soul alſo.</hi> Her Soul was pierced for him, both as his natural Mother and alſo as a myſtical Member of him her Head; therefore Chriſt applies theſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Words as a Salve to her Wounds, even whilſt his own were bleeding unto death: <hi>Woman, behold thy Son. Where Note,</hi> He calls her <hi>Woman,</hi> and not Mother; he doth not ſay, Mother, behold thy Son; but, Woman, behold him: Not that Chriſt was aſhamed of, or unwilling to own her for his Mother: But either, 1. Fearing that calling her by that name ſhould augment and increaſe her Grief and Trouble. Or elſe, 2. To intimate his change of State and Condition, that being ready to die and return to his Father in Heaven, he was above all earthly Relations, and knew no one after the Fleſh, no not his very Mother: Yet ſee at the ſame time, when he was above her, and about to leave her, how his Care manifeſted it ſelf for her, when his Soul and Body were full of Anguiſh to the very brim: Yet all this makes him not in the leaſt unmindful of ſo dear a Relation. <hi>Thence learn,</hi> That Chriſt's tender Care of his Mother, even in the time of his greateſt Diſtreſs, is an excellent Pattern for all Children to imitate and follow, to the end of the World. St. <hi>John</hi> here obeyed Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and imitated his Example, he took her to his own Home; that is, he treated her with all that dutiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard which a tender and indulgent Mother challenges from a pious and obedient Son. No perſonal Trial or Trouble upon our ſelves, doth exempt us from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our Duty towards others, eſpecially towards our near and dear Relations. Chriſt in the extremity of his Sufferings, accounted it his Duty to take care of and provide for his dear Mother: <hi>Teaching</hi> us by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That Children ought to evidence that they honour their Parents, by taking care of them in their decayed and deſolate Condition. <hi>Again,</hi> Inaſmuch as St. <hi>John</hi> took care of the holy Mother after her dear Son's death: <hi>That Diſciple took her to his own home. We Learn,</hi> That the Lord never removes one Comfort, and taketh away the means of ſubſiſtance from his People, but he raiſes up another in the room of it. It is very probable that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> her Husband was before this time dead, and Jeſus her Son was now dying; but ſtill God provides, he raiſes up St. <hi>John</hi> to take care of her; he takes her to his own Home, and looks upon her as one of his Family. But how comes St. <hi>John</hi> above the reſt to have this honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service put upon him, and this high Truſt repoſed in him? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Text tells us, <hi>he was the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved;</hi> that is, in a more eſpecial manner, treating him with greater Freedom and Familiarity than the reſt; he alſo evidenced more Love unto, and more Courage and Reſolution for Chriſt than the reſt of his Diſciples, he ſtanding by the Croſs, when they got afar off, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.49. <hi>Thence we learn,</hi> That ſuch as are beloved of
<pb facs="tcp:46556:164"/> Chriſt, as do keep cloſe unto him, and expreſs moſt Zeal and Reſolution for him, they ſhall be peculiarly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, and be employed in the higheſt Services for him.</p>
               <p n="28">28 ¶ After this, Jeſus knowing that all things were now accompliſhed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaith, I thirſt. 29 Now there was ſet a veſſel full of vineger: and they filled a ſpunge with vineger, and put it upon hyſſop, and put it to his mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Affliction or Suffering which our Saviour complained of, and that is Thirſt; there are two ſorts of Thirſt; one Natural and Proper, the other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Figurative: Chriſt felt both at this time. His Body Thirſted by Reaſon of thoſe Agonies which it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under. His Soul Thirſted in vehement Deſires, and fervent longings to accompliſh that great and difficult Work he was now about. 2. The deſign and end of our Lord's Complaint. <hi>That the Scripture might be fulfilled, he ſaith, I Thirſt.</hi> Our Saviour finding that all was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which he was to do before his Death; but only the fulfilling that one Scripture, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.21. <hi>They gave me Vineger to Drink.</hi> He for the accompliſhment thereof. <hi>Said I Thirſt. Whence Note,</hi> That ſuch were the Agonies and Extream Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, that they drank up his very Spirits, and made him cry, <hi>I Thirſt.</hi> 2. That when Chriſt cried out, <hi>I Thirſt;</hi> it was to ſhew that what ever was foretold by the Prophets concerning him, was exactly accompliſhed, and even to a Circumſtance fulfilled in him. <hi>That the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jeſus ſaith, I Thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30 When Jeſus therefore had received the vineger, he ſaid, It is finiſhed: and he bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Our Lord's laſt word, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> 2. His laſt Act, <hi>He bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> As to the former, his laſt Word, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> This might be the probable intendment of it. 1. <hi>It is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> That is, Now is my Father's Eternal Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me accompliſhed; and now is the Promiſe that he made of my becoming a Sacrifice for Sin fulfilled; both my Father's Purpoſe and my Father's Promiſe, are now receiving their final Accompliſhment. 2. <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> that is, the Scriptures are now fulfilled; all the Types that did prefigure me, all the Prophetical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that were made of me, all the Jewiſh Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that pointed at me, have now received their final accompliſhment in me, and are aboliſhed in my Death. 3. <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> that is, my Sufferings are now ended, my Race is Run, my work is done, I am now putting my laſt Hand to it, my Death is before me, I have finiſhed the Work, the whole Work which I came into the World for, doing, as well as dying; all is upon the matter compleated, it is juſt finiſhing, it will be inſtantly finiſhed. <hi>Again,</hi> 4. <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> that is, the Fury and Malice, the Rage and Revenge of my Enemies is now ended, they have done their worſt; the Chief Prieſts and Soldiers, the Judges and Witneſſes, the Executioners and Tormenters have all tired out themſelves, with the Exerciſe of their own Malice; but now their Spite and Spleen, their Envy and Enmity is ended, and the Son of God's at Reſt. 5. <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> that is, the Glorious work of Man's Redemption and Salvation is perfected and performed, conſummated and compleated, the Price is paid, Satisfaction is given, Redemption is purchaſed, and Salvation inſured to a miſerable World. Woe unto us if Chriſt had left but one farthing of our Debt to the Juſtice of God unpaid, we muſt have lain in Hell to all Eternity, as being inſolvend. <hi>But Chriſt has by one offering for ever perfected them that are ſanctified.

               <p>Theſe Verſes contain ſeveral remarkable paſſages tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Confirmation of our Faith, in the Belief of the certainty and reality of our Saviour's Death; in which the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Soldiers, and St. <hi>John</hi> do all give their ſeveral and ſufficient Evidences. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. The <hi>Jews</hi> part in clearing up this Truth; They deſire <hi>Pilate,</hi> (who had Power alone to diſpoſe of the Dead Bodies of condemned Perſons) that the Legs of the crucified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be broken to haſten their Death, that ſo they might be taken away and buried; becauſe according to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.22, 23. the Land was defiled with thoſe that were hang'd, if not timely buried; and they judged if the Bodies of theſe Perſons did remain on the Croſs all that Night, and the next Sabbath Day <hi>which was an high day,</hi> (the ordinary Sabbath, and the firſt Day of the Paſſover, or Feaſt of unleavened Bread meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) it might pollute both them and their Feaſt. <hi>Where Note,</hi> The curſed Hypocriſie of theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> they look upon themſelves as ſtrictly bound to obſerve an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremony, but their Conſciences never ſcruple to violate the moſt weighty Precepts of the moral Law; they ſtrictly obſerve the Ceremonial Precept, that the dead bodies ſhould not remain upon the Croſs; but they ſcruple not to Crucifie the Son of God, and to uſe him with the utmoſt Rigour, deſiring his Bones may be broken. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. the Soldiers part contributing to clear the Truth of Chriſt's Death; they execute what the <hi>Jews</hi> had deſired and <hi>Pilate</hi> granted, breaking the Legs of the two Thieves, but not of Jeſus, becauſe he was already Dead; but one of the Soldiers reſolving to make ſure work, thruſts a Spear into his Side, and there came out ſtraight way Blood and Water, proving that he was really Dead. All which points out to us, that it is he who came by Water and Blood, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6. and that from the merit and efficacy of his Death there floweth out Blood for the obtaining Remiſſion of Sin, and Water to Regenerate and waſh us from our Uncleanneſs. From the Barbarous Soldiers peircing of Chriſt's Side after he was Dead, <hi>We learn,</hi> That no cruelty was omitted towards Chriſt either Dead or alive, which might teſtifie the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of our Sin; nor was there any needful Evidence wanting, which might make clear the Truth of his Death; the Soldier's piercing of our Saviour's Side was at once an exerciſe of their Cruelty, and an Evidence of the certainty of Chriſt's Death. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. St. <hi>John</hi>'s part in this Evidence, he avouches that Chriſt really died, and expreſly affirms that he ſaw it with his own Eyes, for the confirmation of our Faith; he that ſaw it, bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and his Record is True. And farther ſhews that by theſe Actions of the Soldiers <hi>That</hi> was done, by which ſeveral Scripture-Prophecies <hi>were fulfilled,</hi> and received their Accompliſhment: particularly, That of <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. concerning the Paſchal Lamb, which was a Type of Chriſt, <hi>that a Bone of it ſhould not be broken;</hi> and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have
<pb facs="tcp:46556:164"/> pierced. Learn hence,</hi> That Chriſt is the Truth and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that Type, the Paſchal Lamb, mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and the True Paſſover Sacrificed for us; therefore what was ordained concerning the Paſchal Lamb, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here to Chriſt, as the Subſtance of that Type. <hi>A Bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi>

               <p n="38">38 ¶ And after this, Joſeph of Arimathea, (being a diſciple of Jeſus, but ſecretly for fear of the Jews) beſought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jeſus: and Pilate gave him leave: he came therefore and took the body of Jeſus. 39 And there came alſo Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus (which at the firſt came to Jeſus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrhe and aloes, about an hundred pound <hi>weight.</hi> 40 Then took they the body of Jeſus, and wound it in linen clothes, with the ſpices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 41 Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new ſepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 42 There laid they Jeſus therefore, becauſe of the Jews preparation-<hi>day,</hi> for the ſepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>
               <p>This laſt Paragraph of the Chapter gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Lord's Honourable Burial; ſuch a Funeral as never was ſince Graves were firſt digg'd. <hi>Where Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 1. Our Lord's Body muſt be begg'd before it could be buried; the dead Bodies of Malefactours being in the Power and at the Diſpoſal of the Judg: <hi>Pilate</hi> grants it, and accordingly the dead Body is taken down; wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in fine Linnen and prepared for the Sepulchre. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The Perſons who beſtowed this Honourable Burial upon Chriſt, <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> the one provided fine Linen, the other fine Spices, and they jointly wound and embalmed his Body after the Jewiſh manner; both of them Worthy, tho' cloſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; Grace doth not always make a publick and open ſhew where it is. But as there is much ſecret Treaſure unſeen in the Bowels of the Earth, ſo is there much Grace in the Hearts of ſome Saints, which the World takes little notice of. We Read of none of the Apoſtles at Chriſt's Funeral; fear had put them to flight; but <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> appear bold: If God ſtrengthen the weak, and leave the ſtrong to the prevalency of their own fears, the weak ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> and the ſtrong as Tow. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. The Grave, or Sepulchre in which our Lord was buried, it was a <hi>Sepulchre in a Garden,</hi> to expiate <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin committed in a Garden; as by the Sin of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we were driven out of <hi>Paradice,</hi> the Garden of Pleaſure; ſo by the Sufferings of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> who lay buried in a Garden, we may hope for Entrance into the Heavenly <hi>Paradice.</hi> And it was in a <hi>new</hi> Sepulchre wherein never any Man was laid, leſt his Adverſaries ſhould ſay, it was another that was Riſen, who was buried there before, or that he Aroſe as one of the Old Prophets did, by touching the Bones of ſome other Dead Perſon. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. The manner of our Lord's Funeral, it was haſty, publick, and decent; it was haſty by reaſon of the ſtreights of Time; the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was approaching, and all Buſineſs is laid aſide to prepare for that. <hi>Teaching us,</hi> how much it is our Duty to diſpatch our Worldly buſineſs early in the Evening of the Lord's Day; that we may be the better prepared to Sanctifie that Day. Again, our Lord's Funeral was publick and open, all Perſons that would, might be Spectators, to cut off occaſion from any to object that there was deceit, and fraud uſed in or about our Lord's Burial; yet was he alſo Interr'd decently, his Holy Body being wrapt in fine Linen, and perfum'd with Spices, according to the Jewiſh Cuſtom. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 5. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why our Lord was thus buried, ſeeing he was to Riſe again in as ſhort a time as other Men lie by the Walls; doubtleſs it was to declare the certainty of his Death, and the reality of his Reſurrection, to fulfill the Types and Propheſies which went before of him; <hi>As</hi> Jonas <hi>being three Days and three Nights in the Whale's Belly;</hi> he was alſo buried to compleat his Humiliation, this being the loweſt ſtep to which he could deſcend in his abaſed State. Finally he went into the Grave, that he might conquer Death in its own Territories. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> Of what uſe our Lord's Burial is to us his followers. It ſhews us the amazing depths of his Humiliation, from what and to what his Love brought him, even from the Boſom of his Father to the Boſom of the Grave. It may alſo comfort us againſt the fears of Death; the Grave could not long keep Chriſt, it ſhall not always keep us; it was a loathſome Priſon before, it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd Bed now; he whoſe Head is in Heaven, need not fear to put his Feet into the Grave. Awake and Sing thou that dwelleſt in the Duſt, for the Enmity of the Grave is ſlain by Chriſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>This and the following Chapter gives us an Account of our Saviour's Exaltation, and Victorious Triumph over all his Enemies, by his powerful Reſurrection. All the four Evangeliſts do confirm the Truth of it, by recording the ſeveral ſteps and degrees of the manifeſtation of it. In this Chapter, Chriſt's Reſurrection is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> next to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> then to all the Diſciples except <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 THe firſt <hi>day</hi> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark, unto the ſepulchre, and ſeeth the ſtone taken away from the ſepulchre.</p>
               <p>In this Verſe is Recorded how <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> came early to the Sepulchre, on the firſt Day of the Week to Anoint the Dead Body of our Lord Jeſus. <hi>Where Note,</hi> That tho' her Heart did burn with an ardent Zeal and Affection to her Crucified Lord, yet the commanded Duties of the Sabbath were not omitted by her, ſhe kept cloſe, and ſilently ſpent that Holy Day in a mixture of Grief and Hope; her Example is a good Pattern of Sabbath-Sanctification, and worthy of our Chriſtian Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Note,</hi> 2. What magnanimity and courage is found in this weak Woman, ſhe followed Chriſt Couragiouſly, when his Diſciples left him Cowardly; ſhe accompanied him to his Croſs, ſhe followed his Hearſe to the Grave, when his Diſciples durſt not appear; and now very early in the Morning ſhe goes to viſit his Sepulchre, fearing neither the Darkneſs of the Night, nor the preſence of the Watch-men. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That Courage is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gift of God, and if he gives it to the feebler Sex, even to timerous and fearful Women, it is not in the Power of Man to make them afraid.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Then ſhe runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other diſciple whom Jeſus loved, and ſaith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the ſepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</p>
               <p>It was a great Honour that God put upon this poor Woman, <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> that ſhe has the firſt Notice of our Saviour's Reſurrection, and is the firſt that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it to the Apoſtles. But why had not the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> his Diſconſolate Mother this Priviledge conferr'd on her, rather than <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> who had been a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sinner? Doubtleſs, this was for the Comfort of all True Pentitents, and Adminiſters great Conſolation to them: As the Angels in Heaven Rejoyce, much more doth Chriſt Joy in the Recovery of one repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than in multitudes of Holy and Juſt Perſons (ſuch was the bleſſed Virgin) who need no Repentance.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other diſciple, and came to the ſepulchre. 4 So they ran both together: and the other diſciple did outrun Peter, and came firſt to the ſepulchre. 5 And he ſtouping down <hi>and looking in,</hi> ſaw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the ſepulchre, and ſeeth the linen clothes lie. 7 And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it ſelf. 8 Then
<pb facs="tcp:46556:165"/> went in alſo that other diſciple which came firſt to the ſepulchre, and he ſaw, and believed. 9 For as yet they knew not the ſcripture, that he muſt riſe again from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here obſerve,</hi> 1. How <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> moved with <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> words, <hi>They have taken away the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> do run to the Sepulchre to ſatisfie themſelves in the Truth of it. Such as ſincerely Love Chriſt, upon the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that he is miſſing, beſtir themſelves with great Activity and Diligence, that they may ſee him, or hear of him; <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> run to the Sepulchre to ſee what was become of their Holy Maſter. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That there were ſuch clear Evidences about Chriſt's Grave, as made it apparent that he was indeed Riſen from the Dead, and not conveighed away either by Friends or Foes; It cannot be ſuppoſed that any of his Friends (could they have come at it) would have ſo handled his Holy Body, as to carry it away naked; and for his Foes had they Stole away the Body, they would never have left the Fine Linnen behind them. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. That when Chriſt aroſe from the Grave, he left his Grave Cloaths behind him; whereas when <hi>Lazarus</hi> aroſe, he came forth with his Grave Cloaths about him; it <hi>Teaches</hi> us that Chriſt Roſe never to Die more, but to Live and Reign for ever; therefore he left his Grave Cloaths in the Grave, as never to make uſe of them more. But <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to Die again, Death was once more to have Dominion over him; he therefore came forth with his Grave Cloaths about him. <hi>Obſerve Laſtly,</hi> How ignorant the Apoſtles were of the Doctrine of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and of the Holy Scriptures, which declared he was to Riſe again from the Dead. <hi>They knew not the Scriptures:</hi> That is, They did not heed and regard them, ponder them in their Hearts, and feed upon them by Faith.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Then the diſciples went away again unto their own home. 11 ¶ But Mary ſtood without at the ſepulchre, weeping: and as ſhe wept, ſhe ſtouped down, <hi>and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> into the ſepulchre, 12 And ſeeth two angels in white, ſitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jeſus had layen:</p>
               <p>Here we have a Deſcription of the great Love of <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> which ſhe expreſſed towards Chriſt after his Reſurrection; ſhe went to his Sepulchre early, when it was yet dark, ſhe haſtily calls the Diſciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to the Sepulchre. And ſhe ſtays behind weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sepulchre, when they were gone away to their own home. And as <hi>Mary</hi> firſt ſought him and longeſt ſought him, ſo ſhe firſt finds him. <hi>Here Note,</hi> 1. <hi>Mary</hi>'s carriage and behaviour towards her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, this is diſcovered by her patient attendance, <hi>She ſtood without at the Sepulchre;</hi> by her paſſionate mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe ſtood at the Sepulchre <hi>weeping;</hi> by her unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diligence, <hi>ſhe ſtooped down and looked into the Sepulchre;</hi> here was great Love indeed in this poor Woman, a Love ſtronger than Death, a Love which did out-ſtrip and go beyond the greateſt Apoſtles. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> 1. That true Love to Chriſt ſuffers not it ſelf to be ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or limited, no not by the greateſt Examples; the weakeſt Woman that truly Loves Chriſt, may piouſly ſtrive with the greateſt Apoſtle in this point; though he be Learneder, Wiſer, more Uſeful and more Eminent than any of us; yet it is Holy and Wiſe, not to ſuffer our ſelves to be exceeded by any in our Love to Chriſt; every Chriſtian may ſtrive to exceed any one in Grace, and to attain the higheſt place in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That ſtrong Love is valiant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, it will grapple and encounter with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oppoſition; <hi>Mary</hi> fears nothing in ſeeking of her Lord, neither the darkneſs of the Night, nor the terror of the Soldiers, nor the malice of the Jews; Love is ſtrong as Death, and the Flames thereof are vehement. <hi>Note farther,</hi> The ſucceſs of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Love to Chriſt, and unwearied Attendance on his Sepulchre; ſhe found not the Dead Body of Chriſt; and it was well ſhe did not; for if Death could have held him, it would not have let us go. But though ſhe found not her Lord in the Grave, ſhe found two of his Servants there, two Angels; of all things in the World, one would leaſt have expected to find an Angel in a Grave, Spirits in the place of Dead Bodies, and Immortality in the place of Corruption. <hi>But from hence we Learn,</hi> That ſuch as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſeek the Lord ſhall certainly find, if not the very thing which they ſeek, yet that which is much fitter and better for them; <hi>Mary</hi> did not find Chriſt's Dead Body, but ſhe finds that which was more comfortable for her to find, <hi>Namely,</hi> Two Angels to teſtifie that he was Riſen. <hi>Where Note,</hi> The poſture of theſe Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; the one ſitting at the Head, the other at the Feet: It is matter of Comfort to the Members of Chriſt, that Angels do not wait upon the Head only, but upon the Feet alſo. And it ought to be matter of imitation, alſo. Let us imitate our bleſſed Saviour, in having an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel not at our Head only, but at our Feet alſo; many have an Ambition to have an Angel at their Head, a great meaſure of Light and Knowledge there; but they care not for an Angel at their Feet, they delight not to walk anſwerably to their Light and Knowledge, they have an Angelical Underſtanding, and a Diabolical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; it is ſad for a Man to have all his Religion in his Brain and Tongue, and nothing in his Heart and Life.</p>
               <p n="13">13 And they ſay unto her, Woman, why weepeſt thou? She ſaith unto them, becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 14 And when ſhe had thus ſaid, ſhe turned her ſelf back, and ſaw Jeſus ſtanding, and knew not that it was Jeſus. 15 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, Why weepeſt thou? Whom ſeekeſt thou? ſhe ſuppoſing him to be the gardner, ſaith unto him, Sir, if thou have born him hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. That the beſt company in the World will not ſatisfie or content ſuch as are ſeeking for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, when they find not him whom their Souls ſeek; <hi>Mary</hi> now enjoyed the Preſence and Company of two Angels, but this did not ſatisfie her in the Abſence of Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How Paſſionately did <hi>Mary</hi> mourn for the Loſs and want of Chriſt's Bodily Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, thereby giving Teſtimony of her great Affection towards him; but truly our Love to Chriſt is beſt ſhewn not by our Paſſionate deſires for his Bodily Preſence, but by our Holy longings after his Spiritual Preſence in his Word and Ordinances here on Earth, and his bleſſed and immediate Preſence in Heaven. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How Chriſt may be preſent with and very near unto his People, and yet not be preſently diſcerned by them; <hi>Jeſus ſtood by Mary, but ſhe knew not that it was Jeſus;</hi> her not expecting a living Chriſt was one cauſe why ſhe did not diſcern him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 4. How exceedingly <hi>Mary</hi>'s thoughts were taken up with Chriſt; ſhe ſaith to the Gardiner, <hi>If thou haſt born him hence.</hi> What <hi>Him?</hi> She doth not ſay whom, but her Heart was ſo taken up with Chriſt, and her Mind ſo full of him, that ſhe concluded every body would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whom ſhe meant, though ſhe did not ſay whom ſhe meant. <hi>Hence Note,</hi> That the Soul of a ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is full of earneſt and longing deſires after Jeſus Chriſt. 2. That ſuch a Soul is yet ſometimes at a loſs for Chriſt, and cannot tell where to find him. 3. That whilſt the Soul is at a loſs for Chriſt, its deſires are often quicker and more ſtirring after Chriſt. This was the caſe of <hi>Mary</hi> here, with the Spouſe, by Night on her Bed, and early in the Morning ſhe ſought him whom her Soul loved.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Mary. She turned her ſelf, and ſaith unto him, Raboni, which is to ſay, Maſter. 17 Jeſus ſaith unto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet aſcended to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and <hi>to</hi> my God and your God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46556:165"/>
               <p>In the former of theſe Verſes, Chriſt makes himſelf known to <hi>Mary,</hi> and calleth her by her Name. In the latter he gives her a Prohibition and an Injunction. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 1. The Prohibition, <hi>Touch me not;</hi> together with the Reaſon of it, <hi>for I am not yet aſcended to my Father.</hi> It is concluded by Interpreters, that <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> was now fallen at Chriſt's Feet, and embraced them; that having found him whom her Soul loveth, ſhe hugs him now, and hangs about him; but Chriſt forbids any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embracing, and rejects ſuch Teſtimonies of her Love; as if he had ſaid, Although I will allow you as much familiarity as ſhall ſatisfactorily Convince you of the verity of my Reſurrection; yet you muſt not expect to converſe with me in that carnal manner which you did before my Death; for I am aſcending to my Father, and muſt be injoyed no longer after a Corporal, but Spiritual manner. <hi>Learn hence.</hi> That our Love to Jeſus Chriſt is beſt ſhewn, not by our Humane, Paſſionate, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to his bodily Preſence, but by our Spiritual Communion with him by Faith here on Earth, in order to an immediate Communion with him face to face in Heaven. Chriſt now after his Reſurrection was advanced to a more Spiritual Condition, therefore refuſes at <hi>Mary</hi>'s Hand the Offices of Humane Converſation, but expects of her the Duties and Services of Spiritual Devotion. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. Chriſt's Injunction. <hi>But go to my Brethren and ſay, I aſcend to my Father, and your Father, to my God and your God. Where Note,</hi> The endearing Title given to the Diſciples. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> he had before his Death called them his Servants, his Friends, his Children, but now after his Reſurrection he calls them his Brethren; he became our Brother, by aſſuming our Nature in his Incarnation, he continues our Brother by reſuming that Nature at his Reſurrection <hi>Note farther,</hi> That Chriſt calls his Diſciples Brethren after his Exaltation and Reſurrection; thereby ſhewing that the change of his condition, had wrought no change in his Affection towards his poor Diſciples; but thoſe that were his Brethren before, in the time of his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Abaſement are ſo ſtill, after his Exaltation and Advancement. <hi>Go to my Brethren and ſay,</hi> Humility doth not only go before Honour, but it dwells with Honour, and doth ever more accompany it. <hi>Obſerve laſtly,</hi> The good News or Meſſage of Joy which Chriſt ſends by <hi>Mary</hi> to his dear Diſciples; <hi>ſay, I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God;</hi> as if Nature and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gave the ſame Intereſt. Chriſt calls God, his God and his Diſciples God, his Father and their Father; firſt his, and then theirs, and therefore theirs becauſe his. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That God for Chriſt's ſake hath dignified Believers with that near and dear Relation of his being a Father to them in and through his Son; ſo that as they ought to carry it towards him like Children by Obedience, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Reſignation; ſo they may expect he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Fatherly Affection towards them, and they may expect from him Fatherly Compaſſion, Proviſion, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Correction, and all things needful.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Mary Magdalene came and told the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that ſhe had ſeen the Lord, and that he had ſpoken theſe things unto her. 19 ¶ Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt <hi>day</hi> of the week, when the doors were ſhut, where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith unto them, Peace <hi>be</hi> unto you. 20 And when he had ſo ſaid, he ſhewed unto them <hi>his</hi> hands and his ſide. Then were the diſciples glad when they ſaw the Lord.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour's firſt appearing after his Reſurrection, having been to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> as the former Verſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us: The ſame Day at Evening, when the Doors were ſhut for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jeſus miraculouſly, and as to the Diſciples inſenſibly, opens the Doors, and ſtands in the midſt of them, and ſays, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> and ſhews them his Hands and his Side. <hi>Where Note,</hi> 1. That it has been no ſtrange thing in the Church, that the beſt Members of it have been put to frequent their Aſſemblies with great fear, and been forced to meet in the Night with great Caution, becauſe of the Fury of the Perſecutors: Here Chriſt's own Diſciples were forced to get together in the Night, the Doors kept ſhut, <hi>for fear of the Jews. Note,</hi> 2. Let Chriſt's Diſciples meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether never ſo privately, and with never ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and jeopardy, they ſhall have Chriſt's Company with them; neither Bolts, nor Locks, nor faſtned Doors ſhall hold Chriſt from them: <hi>When the Doors were ſhut, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came and ſtood in the midſt of them. Obſerve laſtly,</hi> The Evidence which our Saviour offers to evince and prove the certainty of his Reſurrection; <hi>he ſhewed his Diſciples his Hands and his Feet.</hi> Chriſt appealed to, and admitted of the Judgment of their Senſes, to aſſure them that it was his real Body. And if we muſt not be allowed to believe our Senſes (as the Romiſh Synagogue would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us) we ſhall want the beſt external Evidence we can have to prove the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; <hi>namely,</hi> the Miracles of our Saviour: For how can we be aſſured that thoſe Miracles were true, but by the Judgment of our Senſes? Now as our Senſes tell us that Chriſt's Miracles were true, ſo they aſſure us that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is falſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Then ſaid Jeſus to them again, Peace <hi>be</hi> unto you: as <hi>my</hi> Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you. 22 And when he had ſaid this, he breathed on <hi>them,</hi> and ſaith unto them, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye the holy Ghoſt. 23 Whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; <hi>and</hi> whoſe ſoever <hi>ſins</hi> ye retain, they are retained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The Repetition of our Saviour's endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Salutation to his Diſciples. <hi>Peace be unto you, Peace be unto you.</hi> This was no more than might be needful, to ſignifie his firm Reconciliation to them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their late Cowardize in forſaking of him, and flying from him, when the Storm fell upon him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. How Chriſt doth renew his Diſciples Commiſſion for the Work of the Miniſtry, who poſſibly were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the remembrance of their faint-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the time of his Sufferings; he doth therefore anew Commiſſionate them, and ſends them forth in theſe Words: <hi>As my Father ſent me;</hi> that is, to preach, plant and propagate the Goſpel, <hi>ſo ſend I you.</hi> By the ſame Authority, and for the ſame Ends, in part, for which I was ſent by my Father, do I ſend you; <hi>namely,</hi> to gather, to govern, and inſtruct my Church. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That when Chriſt left the World, he did not leave his Church deſtitute of a Goſpel-Miniſtry, which ſhall continue to the end of the World. As Chriſt was ſent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo are his Miniſters ſent by him; and they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, having the ſame Authority and Commiſſion, the ſame Succeſs and Bleſſing; and the Contempt caſt upon them and their Meſſage, ultimately reflects upon God and Chriſt, whoſe Meſſengers they are. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How Chriſt that ſends them forth, doth furniſh them with the Gifts of the Spirit for their Office: <hi>He breathed on them and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, the Gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. They had received the Holy Spirit before as a Spirit of Sanctification; here they receive it in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts, to fit them for their Office. And Chriſt's conferring the Holy Ghoſt by breathing upon them, ſhews that the Holy Spirit proceeds as well from the Son as from the Father. And as by God's breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the firſt Man was made a living Soul; ſo by Chriſt's breathing on the Apoſtles, they were quickened and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily enabled for the Service they were called to. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That when Chriſt ſends forth any about his Work, he will furniſh them with Endowments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their vaſt Employment: And the beſt Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture they can have, is the Holy Spirit in his Gifts and Qualifications ſuitable to their Work. <hi>He breathed on them and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt. Obſerve,</hi> 4. How Chriſt aſſerts their Authority in the diſcharge of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and declares that what they act Miniſterially, according to their Commiſſion here on Earth, is ratified in Heaven: <hi>Whoſe Sins ye remit, they are remitted. Where Note,</hi> That there is a twofold Power of remitting or forgiving Sins; the one Magiſterial and Authoritative; this belongs to Chriſt alone: The other Miniſterial and Declarative; this belongs to Chriſt's Ambaſſadors, who have a Power in his Name to bind and looſe. It is a pious <hi>Note</hi> of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon this Place, That Chriſt firſt conferr'd the Holy Ghoſt upon his Apoſtles, and then ſaid, Whoſe Sins ye remit, they are remitted. Thereby
<pb facs="tcp:46556:166"/> intimating that it is not they, but the Holy Ghoſt by them, that puts away Sin. <hi>For who can forgive Sin, but God only?</hi> The Power of forgiving Sin that Man hath, is only to declare, That if Men be truly and really Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, their Sins are forgiven them, for the ſake of Chriſt's ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="24">24 ¶ But Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus, was not with them when Jeſus came. 25 The other diſciples therefore ſaid unto him, We have ſeen the Lord. But he ſaid unto them, Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</p>
               <p>What the cauſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> his abſence was, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; it is evident that he was not with the reſt of the Diſciples when Chriſt appeared to them; and his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had like to have coſt him dear, even the loſs of his Faith; and he might have had cauſe for ever to have bewailed his abſence from that Meeting of the Diſciples, had not Chriſt been more merciful. <hi>Learn thence,</hi> That the letting ſlip of one holy Opportunity may prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly prejudicial to the Souls Advantage: It is wiſe and ſafe to lay hold upon every Opportunity for injoying Communion with God and Fellowſhip with his Saints. <hi>Thomas</hi> his abſence deprived him not only of the good News which <hi>Mary</hi> brought of Chriſt's being riſen, but alſo of the ſight of him; which the other Diſciples got by aſſembling together; and for want thereof <hi>Thomas</hi> is left under many Doubts and Fears. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve farther,</hi> What a ſtrange Declaration <hi>Thomas</hi> makes of his obſtinate Unbelief. <hi>Except I ſee the print of the nails, and put my finger into his ſide, I will not believe. Where Note,</hi> How ſtrangely rooted Unbelief is in the Hearts of holy Men, inſomuch that they deſire the Objects of Faith ſhould fall under the view of their Senſes. <hi>Thomas</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Faith at his Fingers ends, he will believe no more than he can ſee or feel; whereas Faith is the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen.</p>
               <p n="26">26 ¶ And after eight days, again his diſciples were within, and Thomas with them: <hi>then</hi> came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut, and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid, Peace <hi>be</hi> unto you. 27 Then ſaith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither, thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide: and be not faithleſs, but believing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here, Firſt,</hi> Our Saviour's appearing again to his Diſciples after his Reſurrection, it was eight days after he firſt aroſe, which was the firſt day of the Week. <hi>Here Note,</hi> That Chriſt's riſing the firſt day of the Week, and appearing on the next Firſt-day of the Week after to the Diſciples, and they obſerving that Day for their ſolemn Aſſemblies, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> adminiſtring on that Day the Lord's Supper, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and commanding on that Day Collections for the Poor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. and St. <hi>John</hi> calling it the Lord's-Day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. From theſe Authorities, and the Primitive Practice, we derive our Chriſtian Sabbath: For we do not find in all the Scripture one Inſtance, of any one Congregation of Chriſtians only aſſembling upon the Jewiſh Sabbath, but on the Firſt Day of the Week, on which we ground our Obſervation of that Day. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 2. The wonderful Condeſcenſion of Chriſt to the weakneſs of <hi>Thomas</hi> his Faith, he bids him <hi>reach forth his hand, and thruſt it into his ſide.</hi> Not that Chriſt was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, but only pitiful towards <hi>Thomas</hi> his Infirmities; and it ought to be no encouragement to any Perſon to follow his Example, in ſeeking or expecting the like Signs of their own preſcribing for helping of their Faith. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 3. How mercifully Chriſt over-ruled <hi>Thomas</hi> his Unbelief for the Confirmation of our Faith. His Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved a means for eſtabliſhing his own and our Faith. Therefore ſays <hi>Gregory</hi> well, <hi>Plus mihi profuit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatio Thomae quam credulitas Mariae.</hi> Had not <hi>Thomas</hi> doubted, we had not been ſo fully aſſured that it was the ſame Chriſt that was crucified who roſe again.</p>
               <p n="28">28 And Thomas anſwered and ſaid unto him, My Lord and my God.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words may be conſidered two ways. 1. As an abrupt Speech, importing a vehement Admiration of Chriſt's Mercy towards him, and of his own Stupidity and Dulneſs to believe. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That the convincing Condeſcenſion of Chriſt turns Unbelief into a Rapture of holy Admiration and humble Adoration. 2. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Thomas, My Lord and my God,</hi> contains a ſhort but abſolute Confeſſion of Faith. <hi>Thomas</hi> rightly collects from his Reſurrection, that he was Lord, God, bleſſed for evermore, the true Meſſias, the expected Redeemer, and accordingly with an explicite Faith he now profeſſes his Intereſt in him, ſaying, <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed: bleſſed <hi>are</hi> they that have not ſeen, and <hi>yet</hi> have believed.</p>
               <p>Here we have Chriſt's Reprehenſion of <hi>Thomas</hi> for not believing without ſuch ſenſible Evidence as he deſired. He believed now that Chriſt was riſen from the Dead, but it was upon the Teſtimony of his Senſes only: Therefore Chriſt tells him, that his Faith would have been more excellent and more eminently rewardable if he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved without ſuch demonſtrative Evidence. <hi>Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Therefore to give Credit to a thing upon the Evidence of Senſe, is not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> How Chriſt pronounces them Bleſſed who ſhould hereafter believe on him through the preaching of the Goſpel, though they did not ſee him as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, nor handle him as he might. This is a ſure Rule, that by how much our Faith ſtands in leſs need of the external Evidence of Senſe, the ſtronger our Faith is, and the more acceptable it is, provided what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve be revealed in the Word of God. <hi>Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30 ¶ And many other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his diſciples, which are not written in this book. 31 But theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 2. The true End for which the Miracles of Chriſt were ſo carefully recorded; <hi>namely, that we might believe.</hi> By believing that Chriſt is the Son of God, we have Life; and by the Evidence of his Miracles we know and believe him to have been the Son of God: The Miracles which Chriſt wrought were the beſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Evidence of his Miſſion. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. That all Chriſt's Miracles, both before his Paſſion and after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were not recorded by the Evangeliſts. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The great Point concerning Chriſt to be known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the Scriptures is this, That Jeſus the Son of the Virgin is the promiſed Meſſiah, the anointed of the Father, he in whom all the Types and Shadows of the Law are accompliſhed; and that this Jeſus is for Nature Co-eſſential, for Dignity Co-equal, and for Time Co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with the Father: One in Eſſence, equal in Power and Glory. Thus believing that Jeſus is the Son of God, and accompanying that Belief with a holy Life, if we believe well and live well, we ſhall have Life through his Name.</p>

               <p>AFter theſe things Jeſus ſhewed himſelf again to the diſciples at the ſea of Tiberias; and on this wiſe ſhewed he <hi>himſelf:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foregoing Chapter acquainted us with ſeveral Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Chriſt to his Diſciples after his Reſurrection: All which were in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This Chapter acquaints us with his appearing to his Diſciples in <hi>Galilee,</hi> whither he had ordered his Diſciples to go, promiſing there to meet them. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> now becomes a forſaken Place, a People abandoned to deſtruction, Chriſt will not ſhew himſelf openly to them; but <hi>Gallilee</hi> was a Place where Chriſt's Miniſtry had found better acceptance; to <hi>Galilee</hi> therefore doth he go. Such Places wherein Chriſt is moſt welcome to preach, ſhall be moſt honoured with his Preſence. <hi>Jeſus ſhewed himſelf to his Diſciples at the Sea of Tiberias,</hi> called elſewhere <hi>the Sea of Galilee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:46556:166"/>2 There were together Simon Peter, and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <hi>ſons</hi> of Zebedee, and two other of his diſciples. 3 Simon Peter ſaith unto them, I go a fiſhing. They ſay unto him, We alſo go with thee. They went forth, and entred into a ſhip immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> That after Chriſt was crucified the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples returned for a time to their Trade and Employment of Fiſhing; tho' they were called to be Fiſhers of Men, yet Churches not being gathered and conſtituted at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor able to maintain them, they labour with their Hands to ſupply their preſent Neceſſities. Afterwards, when at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> they had received thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which did furniſh them for preaching the Goſpel to all Nations, and they went forth to plant and propagate the Goſpel, we may believe they then gave over the Labours of their Secular Calling, and applied themſelves wholly to the Work of the Miniſtry. That may be done <hi>(in Eccleſiâ Conſtituendâ)</hi> in a Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which is conſtituting or about to be conſtituted, which is not convenient to be done in a Church already conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Obſerve farther,</hi> How <hi>Peter,</hi> with the reſt, <hi>toil all night and catch nothing;</hi> but no ſooner is Chriſt come among them, but they incloſe a multitude of Fiſhes. Thereby teaching us, That all human Labours and Endeavours are in vain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chriſt by his Preſence and Bleſſing crown them with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But when the morning was now come Jeſus ſtood on the ſhoar: but the diſciples knew not that it was Jeſus. 5 Then Jeſus ſaith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They anſwered him, No. 6 And he ſaid unto them, Caſt the net on the right ſide of the ſhip, and ye ſhall find. They caſt therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Chriſt was near, very near to his Diſciples, but they perceive it not: <hi>Jeſus ſtood on the ſhoar, but they knew not that it was Jeſus. Learn,</hi> Chriſt is not always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by us when he is preſent with us; it is a double Mercy to enjoy his Company, and to know indeed that it is he. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. Altho' they had laboured all the Night in vain, yet at Chriſt's Command they go to Work again, and with great ſucceſs; <hi>they were not able to draw the Net for the multitude of Fiſhes.</hi> When Chriſt is about to do great things for his People, yet will he have them exert all poſſible Endeavours of their own; and the want of former Succeſs muſt not diſcourage from future Endeavours, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> 3. What a Proof Chriſt here gives of his Divinity and Godhead: How were all the Fiſh in the Sea at his Pleaſure, and obedient to his Command! He knew where they ſwim, and brings them from one part of the Lake to the other, <hi>where the Diſciples had toil'd all night and caught nothing.</hi> Chriſt our Mediator is true God, and as ſuch has a Sovereign Power and Providence over all the Creatures; the Cattel on a thouſand Hills, and all the Fiſh ſwimming in the Sea are obedient to his Power and obſervant of his Commands.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Therefore that diſciple whom Jeſus loved, ſaith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <hi>his</hi> fiſhers coat <hi>unto him,</hi> (for he was naked) and did caſt himſelf into the ſea. 8 And the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came in a little ſhip (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fiſhes. 9 Aſſoon then as they were come to land, they ſaw a fire of coals there, and fiſh laid thereon, and bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. The great Zeal and Forwardneſs of <hi>Peter;</hi> hearing that it was Chriſt, he leaps into the Sea to get to him. Oh how inviting, attractive, and alluring, is a ſight of Chriſt! It will make thoſe that know him, break thro' all Difficulties to come unto him. It is not a Sea of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no not Seas of Blood, that can keep a zealous Soul at a diſtance from Chriſt. <hi>When Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his Coat and caſt himſelf into the Sea. Obſerve</hi> 2. What a Complication of Miracles here were; as ſoon as they came to Land they diſcerned another Miracle, <hi>viz.</hi> A Fire of Coals, and Fiſh laid on and Bread, all created and produced by Chriſt out of nothing, at this time, as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Divine Power; for, before they could get the Fiſh to ſhoar, they ſaw Fiſh broiling upon Coals; which makes it evident that theſe were none of the Fiſh which they had catch'd. Chriſt when he pleaſes, for the Benefit and Comfort of his People, will work Miracle upon Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Mercy upon Mercy, one Wonder upon the head of another. For here after a Miracle at Sea they meet with another Miracle at Land. <hi>As ſoon as they came to Land they ſaw a Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 Jeſus ſaith unto them, Bring of the fiſh, which ye have now caught. 11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fiſhes, an hundred, and fifty and three: and for all there were ſo many, yet was not the net broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. What was Chriſt's End in commanding his Diſciples to bring forth the Fiſh which they had now taken; <hi>namely,</hi> That the ſight of their number and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, together with the ſight of the Net remaining unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, might confirm them in the belief of its being a real Miracle. Chriſt had fed their Bellies before, his buſineſs now is to feed their Minds with the Contemplation of the Greatneſs and Reality of the Miracle. All Chriſt's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were obvious to Senſe, and would bear the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Senſes; not like the lying Wonders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are commonly wrought in the dark to couzen the Vulgar, and are meer Cheats and Impoſtours. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. That this full Draught of Fiſhes which <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples now had, might probably preſage that great and wonderful Succeſs which he and they afterwards were to have, in fiſhing for Men. Here we have an Hundred fifty and three great Fiſhes caught at one Draught; but, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. we find Three thouſand Souls converted by St. <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon. Oh the marvellous ſucceſs of the Goſpel at the firſt preaching and planting of it! Three thouſand then proſelyted by one Sermon. Now we have cauſe to fear that there are Three thouſand Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preached and ſcarce one Soul ſavingly converted. <hi>Lord! Who hath believed our Report?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 Jeſus ſaith unto them, Come <hi>and</hi> dine. And none of the diſciples durſt ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jeſus then cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fiſh likewiſe. 14 This is now the third time that Jeſus ſhewed himſelf to his diſciples, after that he was riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>A twofold Reaſon may be aſſigned why Chriſt did at this time invite and call his Diſciples to dine with him: The firſt and more principal Reaſon was, to evidence to them the reality of his Reſurrection, and to aſſure them of the Truth of his Manhood, that they might not think it was an Apparition only. By the Miracle in catching the Fiſhes, he proved himſelf to be God; by his preſent eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fiſh, he evidenced himſelf to be Man: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently teacheth us, That our exalted High-Prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues our Kinſman in Heaven. He is ſtill Bone of our Bone, and Fleſh of our Fleſh: He has taken poſſeſſion of Heaven in our Nature, ſitting there in our glorified huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, united to the glorious Deity, clothed with that Body which hung in its Blood and Gore upon the Croſs, but now ſhining brighter than ten thouſand Suns. The ſecond and leſs principal Reaſon why Chriſt called his Diſciples to dine with him, was this, To ſhew his tender Care over the Bodies of his dear Diſciples, as being the Tabernacles of his own Spirit, the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt incourages, though not to the pampering, yet to the refreſhing of them. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, Come and dine.</hi> And he would not confer with them till they had dined; as the next Verſe ſhews.</p>
               <p n="15">15 ¶ So when they had dined, Jeſus ſaith to Simon Peter, Simon <hi>ſon</hi> of Jonas, loveſt thou me more then theſe? He ſaith unto him, Yea Lord; thou knoweſt that I love thee. He ſaith unto
<pb facs="tcp:46556:167"/> him, Feed my lambs. 16 He ſaith to him again the ſecond time, Simon <hi>ſon</hi> of Jonas, loveſt thou me? He ſaith unto him, Yea Lord; thou knoweſt that I love thee. He ſaith unto him, Feed my ſheep. 17 He ſaith unto him the third time, Simon <hi>ſon</hi> of Jonas, loveſt thou me? Peter was grieved, becauſe he ſaid unto him the third time, Loveſt thou me? And he ſaid unto him, Lord thou knoweſt all things; thou knoweſt that I love thee. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Feed my ſheep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> 1. Chriſt puts <hi>Peter</hi> upon a threefold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Love unto him; anſwerable to his threefold Denial of him: His threefold Denial required a threefold Confeſſion. True Repentance ought, and will be, as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Fruits and Effects of it, as the Saints Fall hath been. A threefold Denial of Chriſt, ſhall be attended with a threefold profeſſion of Love unto him. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 2. The ſolemn Queſtion put by our Saviour unto <hi>Peter, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou me? Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> That is, more than the reſt of my Diſciples. Doſt thou love me more than thou loveſt them? Or, more than they love me? If ſo, evidence the ſincerity of thy Love to me, by thy Care of mine. <hi>Thence Note,</hi> That Miniſters who are called to take Care of Chriſt's Flock, had need of much Love to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and great Compaſſion for Souls; by which they will be animated and fortified to go through with the Labours and Difficulties, as well as to encounter the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Sufferings which do accompany their Calling. <hi>Simon loveſt thou me? Feed my Flock. Note farther,</hi> That the ſureſt Argument and beſt Evidence of a Miniſter's Love to Jeſus Chriſt, is his conſcientious Care to Feed; that is, to Teach, Inſtruct, and Govern the whole Flock of Chriſt: Lambs and Sheep, weak and ſtrong, the feebleſt in the Fold, were purchaſed by the great Shepherd. And if he judg'd them worth his Blood, well may we judge them worth our Sweat. <hi>Note Again,</hi> That ſuch as would be faithful in their Miniſterial Charge, ought to look upon their People as committed to them by Chriſt himſelf, as loved of him, and committed to their care by him, and for which they muſt be accountable to him. Chriſt calls them three times over, <hi>His</hi> Lambs and <hi>His</hi> Sheep, and as often charges <hi>Peter</hi> to feed them. <hi>Obſerve next, Peter</hi>'s threefold Anſwer to Chriſt's Queſtion. <hi>Simon loveſt thou me more than theſe? Lord! thou knoweſt that I love. Where Note,</hi> 1. The great Modeſty of <hi>Peter</hi> in his Reply, <hi>Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> replies, <hi>Lord, Thou knoweſt that I Love thee;</hi> he doth not ſay, Lord! I Love thee above them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and before them all, here is no boaſting now; once it was ſaid, and <hi>Peter</hi> vaunted, <hi>tho' all Men forſake thee yet will not I;</hi> but now his Fall had taught him Humility, he boaſts not of his Love above others, and makes no compariſon with others, but only ranks himſelf among the true lovers of Chriſt. <hi>Lord! I love thee. Note,</hi> 2. The Evidence that <hi>Peter</hi> gives of his ſincere Love to Chriſt, he dare appeal to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Lord! thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> yea thou that art, Omniſcient, the all-knowing and Heart-ſearching God, <hi>Thou that knoweſt all things,</hi> knoweſt that I Love thee: Oh! 'tis a bleſſed thing when we can and dare Appeal to God's Knowledge, and 'tis matter of high conſolation to know that God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſincerity and Love unto him, and that he knoweth and approveth us as ſuch: <hi>Lord! Thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I Love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 Verily verily I ſay unto thee, When thou waſt young, thou girdedſt thy ſelf, and walkedſt whither thou wouldeſt: but when thou ſhalt be old thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry <hi>thee</hi> whither thou wouldeſt not. 19 This ſpake he, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God. And when he had ſpoken this, he ſaith unto him, Follow me.</p>
               <p>In theſe words our Saviour forewarns <hi>Peter</hi> of his future Sufferings, intimating, that he ſhould prove more ſtout than in his former Trial, when he was young and unexperienced he enjoyed his Liberty, but when he was grown older in Years and ſtronger in Grace, he ſhould willingly ſtretch forth his Hands, and quietly ſuffer himſelf to be bound to the Croſs; for <hi>Peter</hi> (ſay ſome) was not nailed, but tied and bound to the Croſs only, and ſo as a Martyr or Witneſs for the Truth of Chriſt <hi>glorified God</hi> by his Death. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> 1. The Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt when they undertake the charge of his Flock muſt prepare for ſuffering work, and lot upon it: Therefore is this Prediction of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſufferings joined with the former injunction, <hi>feed my Sheep.</hi> 2. That Humane Nature in Chriſt's Miniſters as well as in other Men reluctates Sufferings, has an antipathy againſt a violent Death, <hi>They ſhall carry thee whither thou wouldeſt not.</hi> 3. From the time of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſufferings, <hi>when he is old. Learn,</hi> That the timing of the Saints Sufferings is in Chriſt's Hands, he can, and when he pleaſeth doth ſcreen them from ſuffering till old Age; when their work is almoſt done for God, they cloſe their Days with ſuffering for him. <hi>When thou art old thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thine Hands and another ſhall gird thee. Learn laſtly,</hi> That the ſufferings of the Saints in general, and of the Miniſters of Chriſt in particular, do redound much to the Glory of God; which is a conſideration that ought to reconcile them to the Croſs of Chriſt, and ſupport them under it. <hi>This ſpake he ſignifying by what Death he ſhould glorifie God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 Then Peter turning about, ſeeth the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom Jeſus loved, following; which alſo leaned on his breaſt at ſupper, and ſaid, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 21 Peter ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſaith to Jeſus, Lord, and what <hi>ſhall</hi> this man <hi>do?</hi> 22 Jeſus ſaith unto him, If I will that he tarry, till I come, what <hi>is that</hi> to thee? Follow thou me.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour having foretold the manner of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Death in the foregoing Verſes; here in theſe <hi>Peter</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after, and very ſolicitous for, the Knowledge of what kind of Death St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould die. Chriſt cheeks him for his Curioſity, as meddling with that which did not concern him; yet intimates to him, That <hi>John</hi> ſhould live till he came to take Vengeance on the <hi>Jews</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem. If I will that he tarry till I come;</hi> that is, till I come to execute Judgment upon <hi>Jeruſalem. Here we may Note,</hi> There are two great Vanities in Men with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Knowledge; the one, a Neglect to know what is our Duty to know; the other a Curioſity to know what doth not belong to us to know. Chriſt tells <hi>Peter,</hi> it was none of his Buſineſs to inquire what <hi>John</hi> ſhould do: But he ought rather to be preparing for what he himſelf ſhould ſuffer. <hi>If I will that he tarry, what is that to thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Then went this ſaying abroad among the brethren, that that diſciple ſhould not die: yet Jeſus ſaid not unto him, He ſhall not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <hi>is that</hi> to thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Obſerve,</hi> How ſtrangely our Saviour's Words were miſtaken and miſunderſtood by his own Diſciples: They apprehend preſently that <hi>John</hi> ſhould not die: And ſo it paſſed current among them. <hi>From hence we may Note,</hi> How much the Wiſdom of God is and ought to be admired in giving us a written Word, and tying us to it when we ſee erroneous Traditions ſo ſoon on foot in the World, and our Saviour's own Speeches ſo much miſtaken; and that by wiſe and holy Men themſelves in the pureſt Times. Much more may the Words of others be miſreported, and wreſted contrary to their ſenſe and meaning. How great then is the Vanity and Uncertainty of Oral Tradition! Men are naturally prone to miſtake; to miſtake themſelves and to miſtake one another. The more to be admired is their over-daring Ignorance, who think they cannot err. Such an haughty Opinion of a Man's ſelf, concludes him to be neither good nor wiſe.</p>
               <p n="24">24 This is the diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things: and we know that his teſtimony is true.</p>
               <p>The great Modeſty of the holy Evangeliſt St. <hi>John,</hi> is all along throughout his Goſpel very obſervable; he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth himſelf hitherto under a third Perſon, he calleth himſelf a Diſciple, a Learner; who excelled the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Doctors of the Ages ever ſince. Here he ſpeaks more plainly and expreſly concerning himſelf, declaring that he was an Eye-witneſs and an Ear-witneſs of what he wrote, for the greater certainty thereof. And this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
<pb facs="tcp:46556:167"/> here made by the Evangeliſt of the Truth of what he wrote was highly neceſſary, leſt any ſhould think that Chriſt's extraordinary Love and Affection to him (he being the beloved Diſciple) ſhould move him to exceed (as we are prone to do) in writing the Hiſtory of their Lives, who are dear to us and we to them. <hi>Learn hence,</hi> That this Goſpel was written by <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the Narration is of Divine Truth, worthy to be embraced and received by us as a perfect Rule of Faith and Life. <hi>We know that his Teſtimony is true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25 And there are alſo many other things which Jeſus did, the which if they ſhould be written every one, I ſuppoſe that even the world it ſelf could not contain the books that ſhould be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> being about to conclude the Hiſtory of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Life, aſſerts that there were many other Miracles and ſpecial Deeds done by Chriſt both before and after his Paſſions, which he had not recorded or ſet down; becauſe ſhould all that Chriſt did and ſaid be committed to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it would even fill the World, the Volumes would be ſo many. <hi>From hence we gather,</hi> 1. The wonderful Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Induſtry, and Diligence of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he was never Idle, but that his whole Life was ſpent in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good; becauſe, ſhould all the particular Inſtances have been recorded, it would amount to an incredible Bulk. <hi>Learn,</hi> 2. That it is impoſſible to get all ſaid, which might be ſaid of Chriſt, and in his Commendation; ſuch is the tranſcendent Excellency of his Perſon, and the Weakneſs of our Apprehenſions and Judgments, that if all were written, which might be written concerning him, the World it ſelf could not contain the Books which ſhould be written. <hi>Learn laſtly,</hi> That although many of Chriſt's Sermons, Conferences, Miracles, and Actions, be not Recorded; yet it doth not follow, nor can it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from thence, That any neceſſary Doctrine is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or not ſufficiently confirmed: There being ſo much written as it pleaſed God we ſhould know, and was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to know, in order to our Improvement in Faith and Holineſs. If then, after all the Revelation and Diſcovery which God has made of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and of the Way that leads to eternal Salvation by him, Perſons remain willingly ignorant of him and their Duty to him; <hi>Where ſhall they appear? And how ſhall they eſcape?</hi>

            <p>THE deſign of the foregoing <hi>Notes</hi> upon the <hi>Holy Evangeliſts,</hi> being to recommend the <hi>Inſtructive Life</hi> of our <hi>bleſſed Redeemer,</hi> to our <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Imitation.</hi> Altho' <hi>I</hi> have upon all occaſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded his <hi>Example</hi> to be followed by us in all the ſteps of an <hi>Imitable Vertue,</hi> as the matter every where occur'd; yet adjudging it may be <hi>profitable</hi> to ſum up together the ſeveral <hi>Graces and Vertues</hi> which were ſo Orient in the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that having them daily before our Eyes, we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually correcting and reforming of our <hi>Lives</hi> by that bleſſed Pattern. I ſhall therefore briefly offer at it. Becauſe,</p>
            <p>Nothing is ſo proper to form us to <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> it being abſolutely <hi>perfect</hi> and thoroughly Accommodate to our preſent ſtate; there is no <hi>Example</hi> of any meer Man that is to be followed without limitation: But the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was as the pureſt Gold without the leaſt Allay. His converſation was a <hi>living Law,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> which is the <hi>Beſt</hi> and <hi>Holieſt Inſtitution</hi> in the World, is nothing elſe but a <hi>Conformity</hi> to his <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Pattern.</hi> The Univerſal Command of the whole Goſpel is this, <hi>To walk as Chriſt walked.</hi> This denotes a ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, deſign and endeavour to <hi>imitate</hi> and follow him in all the paths of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Particularly let us imitate Jeſus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>IN his early Piety.</hi> We find him at Twelve Years Old <hi>about his Father's Buſineſs, ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing and asking them Queſtions.</hi> See on St. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46.47. An early Piety gives both the Perſon and the Service a peculiar preheminency; no Comfort in Life, no Happineſs in Death, like the Happineſs and Comfort of being good betimes.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>In his Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Earthly Parents.</hi> See on St. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.51. <hi>He went down to Nazareth and was ſubject to them.</hi> He paid Homage to the Womb that bare him, and to his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and reputed Father that provided for him; let a Perſon be never ſo high above others, he is ſtill below his Parents; if the Higheſt upon Earth think their Parents beneath them, and themſelves above their Parents Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Our Saviour did not ſo, what ſhall we think of thoſe Monſters of Ingratitude, the Reproach of Humane Nature; who are aſhamed to own their Parents, becauſe of their Poverty, or, deſpiſe them becauſe of the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Age. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.22. Hearken to thy Father that begat thee, and deſpiſe not thy Mother when ſhe is old.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>In his unwearied Diligence in doing Good,</hi> Acts 10.38. <hi>Who went about doing good.</hi> This was his Meat and Drink by Day, his Reſt and Sleep by Night. He fed the Hungry, cloathed the naked, viſited the Sick, was Eyes to the Blind, Feet to the Lame, and Adminiſtred to ſuch as were in Neceſſities and Streights. And he has declared that he will Judg us at the great Day, according to our imitation of him in doing good to all Mankind. See the Notes on S. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. Ten laſt Verſes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>In his Humility and lowlineſs of Mind. Math.</hi> 11.29. Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart; witneſs his ſtooping to the meaneſt Office, even that of waſhing his Diſciples Feet, S. <hi>John</hi> 13.5. He that came in the form of a Servant, performs the Office of the meaneſt Servant to his Diſciples. And all this was to ſet us an Example of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Condeſcenſion each to other; if I your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your Feet, you ought alſo to waſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Feet; which Precept tho' it doth not bind us to the ſame <hi>Action,</hi> yet it obliges us to the ſame <hi>Condeſcenſion.</hi> Namely, to think no Office of Love beneath us, which the neceſſities of our Brother call for from us.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>In the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nblameableneſs and Inoffenſiveneſs of his Life and Actions.</hi> He injured none and juſtly offended none, but was Harmleſs as well as Holy; he wrought a Miracle to pay Tribute Money, rather than give occaſion of Offence to the Government. See on <hi>Math.</hi> 19.27. Accordingly let us be Harmleſs and Blameleſs; Wiſe as Serpents, and Innocent as Doves; Piety without Policy is too ſimple to be ſafe; Policy without Piety is too ſubtile to be good.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>In his Eminent Self-Denial.</hi> He emptied himſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, when he was <hi>Rich as God</hi> from all Eternity; He <hi>impoveriſh'd</hi> himſelf by <hi>becoming Man:</hi> Oh! what did he not deny when he left the Boſom of his Father, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable Delights and Pleaſures which he there enjoyed from all Eternity. And inſtead thereof to Drink the Cup, the Bitter Cup of his Father's wrath for our ſake. Lord! how can we enough abaſe our ſelves for thee, who thus deniedſt thy ſelf for us.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>In his contentment in a low and mean Condition in this World:</hi> Yea in a <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Afflicted Condition;</hi> he would not honour the World ſo far as to have any part of it in his own hand, was therefore of himſelf leſs provided of comfortable accommodations than the Birds of the Air, or the Beaſts of the Field. See <hi>Luke</hi> 9.58. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have neſts, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> Let us learn from him to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age an afflicted Condition with a contented Spirit; let there be no murmurings, complaints, or fooliſh chargings of God heard from us, whatever ſtraits or Troubles we may be brought into; <hi>but in whatſoever ſtate we are, let us be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content.</hi> Phil. 4.11.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>In his frequent performance of the Duty of private Prayer and Faſting;</hi> he ſometimes ſpent a whole Night in Prayer.
<pb facs="tcp:46556:168"/> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. <hi>He went into a Mountain to Pray, and continued all Night in Prayer to God.</hi> And Mark 1.35. <hi>In the morning riſing up a great while before Day, he went into a ſolitary place and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> It is certain we have much more buſineſs with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in Prayer than Chriſt had; he had no Sins to Confeſs, no wants of Grace to make known; yet did he delight with frequency and fervency to perform this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his Heavenly Father. Lord! how doth thy Zeal and forwardneſs condemn our remiſneſs and lukewarmneſs in praying to our heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>In his Affectionate performance of the Duty of Praiſe and Thankſgiving,</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour was a great <hi>Pattern</hi> of <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> Matth. 11.25. <hi>I thank thee Oh Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. John 11.41. <hi>Father I thank thee that thou haſt heard me;</hi> when he was to eat common Bread he received it with <hi>Thankſgiving:</hi> What a Pattern of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs then was Jeſus to his followers! There is hardly any one External Duty which we do not find the Hypocrite performing in Scripture, except this of Thankſgiving and Praiſe; we find <hi>Judas</hi> Repenting, <hi>Ahab</hi> Humbling himſelf, <hi>Saul</hi> Sacrificing; but we do not find any wicked Man in an humble Spiritual manner, bleſſing and praiſing God: Need will make us Beggars, but Grace only Thanks-givers.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>In his Compaſſion towards thoſe that were in Diſtreſs and Miſery.</hi> Matth. 20.34. <hi>Great was his Compaſſion to the Bodies of Men;</hi> he healed all that came unto him, he healed many undeſired; with great Condolency and tender Sympathy, he exerciſed acts of Mercy and Compaſſion when the object of Compaſſion was before him, and did perfectly abhor and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemn all Acts of Cruelty: How great was his Compaſſion to the Souls of Men; what Pains did he take, and what Hazards did he run in preaching the Goſpel to loſt Sinners, in his fervent Prayers for them; but eſpecially in Dying for them! Let us imitate Chriſt herein, as his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion was univerſal to all Mankind, to the whole Man Soul and Body; as it was Active and Operative, as it was exerciſed with marvellous Complacency and delight; as it was a preventing Compaſſion, and an unwearied Compaſſion, ſo let ours be alſo.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. <hi>In his Holy and fruitful Diſcourſe, his Lips dropt as the Honey Comb, and his Tongue was as choice Silver;</hi> when walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Diſciples to <hi>Emaus,</hi> with what Heavenly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe did he entertain them in the way! <hi>See Luke</hi> 24.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A good Pattern for our Imitation, when providentially caſt into ſuch Company as will bear it. Lord! what a Shame and Reproach is it to us, that in common Converſation we ſpend ſo many hours together, in talking over all the News of City and Country, and part without ſpeaking one word of Jeſus Chriſt our beſt Friend.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. <hi>In his free Converſation;</hi> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 19. that is, was of a free and familiar Converſe, Affable and Sociable, not Sower or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, never ſhuning the Society of the worſt of Men, even of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> themſelves; but complying with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Cuſtoms, and accompanying them at their Feaſts. <hi>See on Luke</hi> 5.29. We do not find that when Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to any publick Entertainment that ever he refuſed to go, not ſo much for the pleaſure of Eating, as for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Converſing and doing good; Chriſt converſt with bad Men, but as their Phyſician, not as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion: Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. <hi>In his Patience under Sufferings and Reproaches, when he was reviled he reviled not again;</hi> but under-went the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his Sufferings with admirable Patience and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit; when his Name and Honour ſuffered the vileſt Indignities, Blaſphemies and Reproaches, that the Malice of Satan and the Malignity of wicked Men could belch out againſt it; when he was called a Blaſphemer, a Sorcerer, a Devil, a Wine-bibber, a Glutton, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners. For an innocent Perſon, and a dignified Perſon to bear all this, when he could have look'd all his Enemies into Hell, and have frown'd them into nothing: Verily, to bear all this, without the leaſt <hi>diſcompoſure of Spirit,</hi> is the higheſt Triumph of Patience that ever the World was acquainted with. And why all this, but to leave us an Example that we ſhould follow his Steps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. <hi>In his readineſs to forgive Injuries.</hi> One of his laſt Words upon the Croſs, was a Prayer for his Murtherers; <hi>Father forgive them,</hi> Luke 23.34. He offered up his Blood to God on the behalf of them that ſhed it. Thus to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Enemies, and to beg Forgiveneſs for them, will be an Evidence of a Chriſt-like Frame and Temper; when the Grace of God calms thoſe tumultuous and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Paſſions, which at any time we find raging in our Breaſts, moulding our Spirits into Sweetneſs and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, freeing us from all malicious deſires of Revenge, which are ſo far beneath a Chriſtian, that it is the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Man; yea, as Jealouſie is the Rage of a Man, ſo Malice is the Rage of the Devil; 'tis the very Soul and Spirit of the Apoſtate Nature.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. <hi>In his laying to Heart the Sins as well as the Sufferings of others.</hi> Mark 3.5. <hi>He was grieved for the hardneſs of their Hearts.</hi> Such was his Zeal for his Father's Glory, ſuch his Compaſſion to the Souls of Men, ſuch his Antipathy againſt, and hatred of Sin; that he was grieved for Sin where-ever he found it, and mourned over thoſe who had no Hearts to mourn for themſelves. Lord! how far are they from a Chriſt-like Spirit and Temper, who inſtead of mourning for other Mens Sins, rejoyce in Iniquity, and take Pleaſure to ſee their Brother ſtab at once the Chriſtian Name and his own Soul.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. <hi>In his Zeal for the Publick Worſhip of God.</hi> John 2.17. <hi>The Zeal of thine Houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> Now as Chriſt was, ſo Chriſtians ought to be, intenſly Zealous for the Glory of God, the Honour of his Houſe, and the Purity of his Publick Worſhip. The Zeal of thine Houſe; that is, for the Honour of thine Houſe, hath eaten me up. Our Zeal for the Publick Worſhip of God glorifies him moſt, and he accepts it beſt. Now we own that God, whom we ſerve, in the face of the World: And this creates a veneration and eſteem of God in the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. <hi>In his glorifying of his Father in all he did.</hi> John 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on the Earth.</hi> The whole Life of Jeſus when here on Earth, it was a glorifying of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he glorified his Father by the Doctrine which he taught, by the Miracles which he wrought, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Purity of his Life, and by his unparallel'd Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at his Death. In like manner ſhould we glorifie God in all we do, in all we deſign, in all we deſire; in our natural Actions of eating and drinking, in our Civil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, buying and ſelling, in our lawful Recreations, taking care that too much of our time be not conſumed therein. Recreation is not to be our buſineſs, but to fit us for buſineſs; but eſpecially let us ſeek to glorifie God in our Religious Duties; Publick, and Private and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>In his Impartiality in reproving Sin.</hi> He feared the Faces and ſpared the Faults of no Offenders. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were a Proud and Haughty ſort of People, who diſhonoured God above moſt, when they pretended to glorifie him above any. Therefore we find Chriſt denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Bed-Roll of Woes againſt them in one Chapter. St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Wo to you <hi>Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites;</hi> Eight ſeveral Woes are denounced againſt them, for ſo many ſeveral Sins committed by them: Thoſe to whom God has given Authority to Reprove the Sins of others, ought to imitate their Pattern in his Impartiality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Sin. His very Enemies gave him that Character. St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Thou careſt not for any Man, thou regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not the Perſon of Men:</hi> That is, Thou ſpareſt none, but telleſt all Men of their Faults.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. <hi>In his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Obedience to his Father's Will, and chearful Submiſſion to his Father's Pleaſure.</hi> He obeyed the Will of his Father Univerſally, Voluntarily, Sincerely, and with a ſingle Eye at his Glory, perſeveringly, and to the End; and as he was, ſo muſt we be, faithful to the Death, if ever we expect the Crown of Life. And in like manner did he ſubmit to the Will of his Providence, <hi>Father not as I will, but as thou wilt, not my will but thine be done.</hi> O let us keep this Example continually before us, and every day obey the will of God's Precept univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally. And ſubmit to the Will of his Providence very chearfully, this is Heaven on Earth.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. In his Love and Practice of Univerſal Holineſs both in Heart and Life: He was Holy in his Nature, Holy in his Principle and Motives, Holy in his Aim and Ends; he was <hi>perfectly Holy, preciſely Holy, uniformly Holy, exemplarily Holy;</hi> he delighted only in <hi>holy Perſons and holy Things;</hi> it concerns us to imitate him herein, if ever we expect to be where he is. <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>habitation</hi> of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

'Tis not the place of Heaven can make us Happy, but the Diſpoſition and Temper of our Minds in Heaven; without Conformity to the Nature of God there can be no <hi>Communion</hi> with him, nor <hi>Delight</hi> in him; what a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous Courteſie would it be to turn a filthy Swine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Garden of curious Flowers, to lodge it in a Bed of ſweet Perfumes, to bath it in a clear and Cryſtal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Alas! its <hi>unclean Temper</hi> and <hi>ſordid Inclinations</hi> would rather chooſe to lie down in a <hi>Kennel,</hi> and to wallow in the <hi>Mire,</hi> its proper <hi>Element.</hi> Thus unſuitable would <hi>Heaven</hi> be, that place of greateſt <hi>Happineſs</hi> be the greateſt <hi>

            <p>Yet before I cloſe this Exhortation to an Imitation of Jeſus, I muſt ſubjoin this <hi>cautionary Direction;</hi> Take heed that you do not ſo imitate Chriſt for your <hi>Pattern</hi> as to diſown him for your <hi>Prieſt.</hi> This is the dangerous Error of thoſe, who affirm that the great End of Chriſt's Death was to give the World <hi>an Example</hi> of Patience, Humility, Meekneſs, and the fore-mentioned <hi>Chriſtian Graces,</hi> and that his Sufferings were <hi>Exemplary</hi> but not properly <hi>Satisfactory.</hi> We acknowledge that Chriſt's giving us an Example, was one End of his <hi>coming</hi> into the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Dying</hi> for us, but not <hi>the great End.</hi> A <hi>Subordinate</hi> End, but not the <hi>

But bleſſed be God we have not ſo learned Chriſt; as we are Taught ſo we Believe, that the Holy Jeſus by the Sacrifice of his Death has Redeemed us from Death and Hell, and Saved us from Wrath to come; by a full and adequate payment to Divine Juſtice, and by the Redundancy of his Merit, has purchaſed an Eternal Inheritance for us, and as we are Taught and Believe ſo we Pray,</p>

               <p>Almighty God, who haſt given thine only Son to be unto us, both a Sacrifice for Sin and alſo an Example of Godly Life: Give us Grace that we may always moſt thankfully receive that his ineſtimable Benefit, and alſo daily endeavour our ſelves to follow the bleſſed Steps of his moſt Holy Life; through the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Almighty and everlaſting God, who of thy tender Love towards Mankind, haſt ſent thy Son, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to take upon him our Fleſh, and to ſuffer Death upon the Croſs, that all Mankind ſhould follow the Example of his great Humility: Mercifully grant that we may both follow the Example of his Patience, and alſo be made Partakers of his Reſurrection, through the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
